Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed  with Kiva to give Elizabeth access to a loan that will help her farm  grow into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector.

years rural smallholder women have lived poor lives In addition, in some parts of Kenya like Kerugoya, more women were rendered poor by the clashes that followed disputed presidential elections of 2007.Priscillah, a youthful 37-year-old farmer from Kerugoya, a remote town in Kenya, is elegant and admirable in spirit and effort. She is a role model, a mentor and an inspiration to many young farmers in her village because of her resilience despite personal challenges and her passion to support her children as a primary caregiver. The living conditions in the Kerugoya area are very tough and you need to have tough skin in order to survive. Priscillah has always shown the resilience to beat all odds. Because of the hardcore poverty in her village, Priscillah started practicing mixed farming and has been doing it for the past 10 years. With time, she has grown her passion about dairy cattle farming. For a living, she sells milk and maize among other varieties of crops and flowers from her farm. She also diversified into a small business \u201cside hustle\u201d. Priscillah is seeking a loan for two things: to purchase a hybrid dairy cow and to buy a chaff cutter. She loves raising cows. However, over the years the biggest challenge for farmers has been diseases. For this reason, most rural farmers would rather keep traditional breeds that are resistant despite being way less productive. Traditional breed is simply not an option for progressive farmers like Priscillah. With your loan, Priscillah is going to buy a high quality breed that is very productive. To curb diseases, she is going to tighten her belt as far as dairy management in the farm is concerned. An efficient management of cattle will be incomplete without a well-planned and adequate housing of cattle. The Chaff cutter which is a mechanical device that is used in cutting hay into smaller pieces will be used in aiding the cow in eating. No food will be left out because the food will be in smaller pieces hence easier feeding of the cow. Through this loan, Priscillah will generate enough income to take care of the farming costs and expand her milk business.\n Lenders if there is someone that you should lend to your $25 or more then that person is Priscillah you will not regret!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":118.91,"image":{"id":1947368,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality breed of dairy cow and a chaffcutter","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-17T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-16T19:20:03Z","loan_amount":825,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Priscillah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":82000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5803.35},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5972.98},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6147.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6327.21},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6512.12},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6702.43},{"due_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6898.31},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7099.92},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7307.41},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7520.97},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7740.77},{"due_date":"2016-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7966.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.39},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.09},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.85},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.52},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.43},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.4},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.52},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.67},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.88},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.41,"local_amount":6202.96,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:00Z","rounded_local_amount":6329.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024117},{"amount":56.5,"local_amount":5615.64,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5730.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112204}],"funded_date":"2015-09-10T02:19:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Etchison","image":null}},{"id":927460,"name":"Peres","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Speaking with Peres, it becomes obvious that she is a very hardworking and helpful woman, and that everything she does is for her family's benefit and wellbeing.

Being a caring and loving mother, Sarah has been able to take care of her family and support them through the profits she has earned from farming. <br \/><br \/>Although Sarah reaps much profit from farming, one challenge that she is facing that is dragging her down and preventing her from reaching the top of the skies is lack of enough land to farm. For this reason, Sarah is seeking a loan of KES 160,000 to be able to buy a piece of land and expand her farming activities. Having so much experience in farming, Sarah is sure that she will make good use of the land and double her profit levels.

Meet Margaret, a 47-year-old mother who is so humble, honest, and a very hardworking woman on this planet Earth. Margaret is a mother of a lovely family that she really adores so much, and will always do anything good so that they never go to bed with hungry stomachs. Margaret hails from the Kerugoya area of Kenya. Margaret never got the opportunity to advance her education and get a white-collar job but this did not kill her dream of wanting to succeed in life. Margaret started farming and has been doing farming for the past three years. Through those years she has gathered so much experience, and all the farming techniques are at her fingertips. <br \/><br \/>Margaret is a woman who is very enterprising, and she is seeking a loan of KES 30,000 to buy seedlings and start horticulture farming on her farm. Margaret wants to take advantage of the favorable weather patterns, a good road network in her village, good soil and a ready market for horticulture products, and reap more profits. <br \/><br \/>Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring women like Margaret make their farming dreams come to reality through training and loan financing. Margaret hopes that through the loan she will improve her living conditions.

Monica is the mother of three lovely children. At a tender age, Monica\u2019s passion for farming and education drove her to start practising mixed farming. She has been doing this for the past 12 years. When you ask, she\u2019ll tell you her most valuable asset is her two-acre farm. But it wasn't always this way. For a long time, Monica\u2019s farm couldn't even sustain her family. In 2013, Monica heard about Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance institution that serves smallholder farmers, and their partnership with Kiva. And from that day, life has never been the same. Like many farmers in the region, Monica keeps a dairy cow and poultry, and grows different varieties of crops. Nandihills has a thriving market for dairy products. Monica has sustained herself through dairy farming. She enjoys the farming lifestyle. She has a connection with farm animals that goes deep, to the extent that she names each of them. Monica dreams of expanding her dairy farm, but due to financial constraints, she has been unable to do so until now. From Kiva lenders, Monica is kindly requesting 30,000 Kenyan Shillings (KES) to purchase a high-yielding dairy cow. This cow will boost milk production on the farm. As a result, she will have more milk for both consumption and sales. With the money from the additional sales, she will be able to service her loan on time. With increased income from the loan, Monica will be able to cover the high cost of farm production. Many farmers compromise quality because of the high input costs. However, with increased income, Monica will not take such measures. In the long run, her family will realize an improved standard of living.<br \/>Monica loves dairy farming you can support her and get her closer to her goals. Make a loan now and be part of her dreams."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":52.3,"image":{"id":1948743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-17T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-16T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.23},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.85},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.3,"local_amount":5229.85,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5285.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024129}],"funded_date":"2015-09-09T21:19:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":929106,"name":"Tukolerewamu Group Lwanda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The group is located in a rural area called Bitabago and is comprised of 11 members and of both men and women.

He is 65 years old and admirable because at his age, despite illnesses and other disadvantages, he is still standing and fighting to work in his farm. His primary source of income is milk, crops and some vegetables that he plants. He also engages in a personal business and has been able to earn a handsome profit from the venture. Geoffrey practices agriculture with a difference; employing youthful energy, enthusiasm and knowledge from the many agricultural trainings he has been attending to broaden his skills. Although he earns handsome profits from farming, he faces one big challenge and that is the high prices of fertilizers, seedlings and inputs, and this is a result of the monopoly that is enjoyed by the only agro-vet shop in his area. <br \/><br \/>He is requesting a loan to start an agro-vet shop. The Githu area has only one agro dealer who is catering for thousands of smallholder farmers who solely depend on him for agricultural inputs. The agro dealer has been making a killing from farmers by charging them extra amounts, since he is the only agro dealer and enjoys a monopoly. Geoffrey wants to change this and seize the business opportunity, and through your loan, he will start an agro-vet shop and tap into the potential agricultural market. <br \/><br \/>Geoffrey will also help the smallholder farmers in his area who for a long time have been having a serious problem accessing affordable farm inputs.

Through the profits she makes, she has been able to take care of her family and provide basic needs for her parents. Vibian lives near Kabirisan in the Nandi Hills area of Kenya, an area with good weather patterns and favorable weather conditions that support farming. <br \/><br \/>Maize is a very common crop in Kenya and is a staple food for many who regularly eat \"ugali,\" or hard porridge cooked from maize. One can usually buy sifted maize flour in the market, but the cost is higher because of the processing. Flour can be less expensive, however, if it is milled directly using a posho mill. The Kabirisan area has only one diesel posho mill that serves a great number of people. The main problem here is that the posho mill keeps breaking down, so farmers cannot grind their maize. Vibian intends to change this by buying another posho mill to serve the area. <br \/><br \/>She will buy an electric, rather than diesel posho mill, as they are more reliable. Hopefully, breakdowns will be few and far between. To accomplish this, Vibian is applying for an 80,000 KES loan through Juhudi Kilimo to buy a mill. Profits derived from the mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan. In the next two years, Vibian sees herself established and running more than one posho mill.

This region has harsh weather patterns, and poultry farming is the only profitable business venture that thrives. <br \/><br \/>Romana is happily married and blessed with four lovely, good-looking children. For the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been selling milk and crop farming. <br \/><br \/>She passionately loves poultry farming. When asked what is most enjoyable about farming, her reply was \u201cselling eggs\u201d. Her biggest challenge is the lack of funds to increase her poultry farming. <br \/><br \/>She is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Poultry farming is the only business that thrives in the Nandihills area because of the harsh weather patterns, so she wants to take full advantage of the poultry business. <br \/><br \/>Romana is a member of Arise and shine self-help group and through the group, she has received training on financial management and saving.

They live on their own family property, constructed of brick and cement, with a metal roof and wood floors. They rely on potable water, electricity, gas, and sewage. His business is the butcher shop. Everyday he drives to the municipal slaughterhouse where he buys large cuts of meat to bring back to the butcher shop to retail. The most commercial cuts are: steak, chuck round, tenderloin, rib-eye, filet, bone marrow, shoulder, sirloin, and ground beef.\r\n\r\nHe says \"I've grown my business and it continues to be a local shop, the technical commercial designation is Carnicer\u00eda Fina, in honor of my mother.\" The advantage of his business is that he owns the property, the disadvantage is the lack of capital needed to purchase entire cuts of meat. His dream is to increase the physical space of his butchery. He wants to be able to purchase a entire cut of meat to sell at his butcher shop. This is his first loan sequence with any institution in 30 years of work. For these reasons Hermogenes is requesting a loan for the purchase of a entire cut of meat to sell at his butcher shop.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":246.76,"image":{"id":1943074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"with the purchase of an entire cut of meat to sell at his butcher shop.

Meet Fridah, a young farmer from the Nkubu area of Kenya who has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture. <br \/><br \/>Fridah is a proud owner of a small parcel of land on which she has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs and some varieties of crops she plants. She also engages in some personal business to make ends meet. <br \/><br \/>Fridah passionately loves farming and she says that she got interested in farming out of a desire to be a solution to food security that remains a thorn in the flesh for all the farmers in Nkubu and Africa as a whole. From farming, she has been able to earn a decent income and she attributes all this success to hardwork and determination. Although she makes profits, she has always wanted to increase her farming and start a cereal-selling business. The main challenge she has been facing is lack of funds. <br \/><br \/>She is seeking a loan to buy cereals. Demand for cereals is overwhelming in Nkubu and through your loan, she intends to buy different varieties of cereals and be able to satisfy the demand in her village and local markets. <br \/><br \/>With your loan, Fridah will improve her living conditions through increased profits from selling cereals. Fridah has been practicing agriculture with a difference, employing youthful energy, enthusiasm and knowledge attained through training from Juhudi Kilimo.

To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business (dressmaking).\r\n\r\nThe Kitale area is very populated, and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high.\r\n\r\nShe lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 15,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman seeking to access funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved and that she will be able to buy more poultry.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the loan, she will sell more eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to an increased profit margin and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry market to other markets; this will increase her income and improve her living conditions.

His highest education level is primary school and he has never succeeded in getting employment. Despite all these adversities he picked himself up and he has been farming for the past 10 years.\r\n\r\nHe decided that he will be independent and contribute to his community by practicing mixed farming. Johana has a wife, and has been blessed with four lovely children that he refers to as \u201cmy heart beat.\u201d His primary sources of income are crops, milk, poultry, and some personal business that he does to supplement his meager income.\r\n\r\nDeciding to practice dairy farming was not difficult for Amos because he emulated what his parents were doing. However, the demand for milk is overwhelming, and he wants to increase his dairy cattle. The biggest challenge is a lack of funds. He is seeking a loan, with which he plans to purchase a quality breed of dairy cow. He passionately loves dairy farming, and when he was asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, he stated, \u201cfeeding my cows.\u201d His hobby is milking his cow.\r\n\r\nHe sells milk to his neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been so high that he cannot meet it. For this reason, he is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing his farm's milk productivity. The dairy cow that he plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10 and 20 liters of milk per day. This will immediately translate to a higher profit margin and increased income level.\r\n\r\nJohana will use profits from selling milk to paying back the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase his business enterprise. Johana is very visionary, and he intends that in the near future he will start adding value to his milk business through packaging the milk before selling. In addition, he plans to start selling other dairy products, such as cream. An improved income level will assure his family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, he will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":153.86,"image":{"id":1944447,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a high-quality breed dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-17T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-16T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Johana","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":67600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4784.25},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4924.07},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5067.94},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5216.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5368.53},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5525.42},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5686.9},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5853.1},{"due_date":"2016-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6024.16},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6200.21},{"due_date":"2016-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6381.42},{"due_date":"2016-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6567.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.61},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.61},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.17},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.79},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.15},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.91},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.72},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":153.86,"local_amount":15408.68,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:51Z","rounded_local_amount":15649.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024063}],"funded_date":"2015-09-15T02:13:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":926817,"name":"Ning","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ning is a 45-year-old woman who is working in a supermarket.

She is very hardworking and determined to increase her banana farm's output.<br \/><br \/>Loans for smallholder farmers with little, irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. A few organizations such as Juhudi Kilimo support farmers like Dorothy. Through a group of 15 members called Mwangaza, Dorothy has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi, which use the group-based savings as collateral. According to Juhudi Kilimo, farming especially banana farming represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled. In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household. Juhudi Kilimo facilitate loans that empower smallholder farmers like Dorothy because the institution believe that women too are actively involved in various segments of the banana farming industry. Her projections are that by the end of the first year she will be selling bananas to different markets in Kenya.

Alice is seeking a loan to purchase modern farming implements. She realized that she is working increasingly longer and harder on her farm. The women in the area are currently doing tasks on the farm previously performed by men. They have been forced to take over.

She has gone through a lot of adversity in her life, but she has always had the strength to get ahead and continue progressing with her family. <br \/><br \/>Sarah is a smallholder farmer based in the Nandi Hills in the Rift Valley of Kenya. She owns a small parcel of land that she uses to grow maize and keep dairy animals. She has also planted trees on it for aesthetic appearances and environmental health. Not only does the land provide her with capital for her business, but also a home for her family. Sarah is blessed to have five children, with a husband to whom she has stayed married to for 15 years! <br \/><br \/>Sarah is seeking a loan to purchase cereals. The cereals she is seeking serve to replenish stock for food and business. The demand for cereals in the Nandi Hills area, only a few kilometers from Sarah's home, is up. Farmers in the area are rushing to grow more cereal crops. By placing herself in a position of supplying cereal seeds and still being a cereal farmer, she gets to enjoy profits from selling inputs and crop harvests.

She has to work hard and always stay strong through all of the adversities that may arise. Purity, a youthful 27-year-old mother, is a wise farmer who is respected by her neighbours and fellow farmers as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Nkubu, which is in the central region of Kenya. Purity is blessed with two lovely angel-looking children. For the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming. She grows maize and vegetables. <br \/><br \/>Purity also does a side hustle business, and she has dairy cows. Purity has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with the challenge of delivering the produce to the market in a timely manner. This challenge has not made her give up and she states: \u201cI have to do something for my family\u201c. <br \/><br \/>Purity joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. <br \/><br \/>She applied for a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders, to buy a motorbike. Purity is from a remote village that has poor roads, poor terrain and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables and tomatoes), which require timely delivery to the market. <br \/><br \/>This loan will help Purity to achieve her dream and reach her goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Purity feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva that help women to gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. <br \/><br \/>The benefits of this loan will be astronomical, because Purity will never suffer losses due to a delay in delivering her produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume, because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. Her income will increase. <br \/><br \/>Purity is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike and help with the farm work. Purity will use the loan to improve her living conditions and assure her children of a secure future. <br \/><br \/>Kindly lend to Purity to keep her big smile because she believes that it takes someone to help someone!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":99.2,"image":{"id":1948673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike to help her deliver her perishable products to the market in a timely manner.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-18T00:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-17T00:20:04Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Purity","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":90000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4866.54},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5008.76},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5155.15},{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5305.81},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5460.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5620.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5784.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5953.78},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6127.78},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6306.86},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6491.18},{"due_date":"2016-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6680.89},{"due_date":"2016-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6876.13},{"due_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":7077.09},{"due_date":"2016-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":7283.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.09},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.55},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.06},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.61},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.2},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.85},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.54},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.28},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.07},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.91},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.81},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.76},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.77},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.08,"local_amount":5308.12,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5354.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024126},{"amount":46.12,"local_amount":4612.36,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4652.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112213}],"funded_date":"2015-08-19T21:52:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":929733,"name":"Flora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flora is a very skilled rural person with experience in various areas of agriculture, with an innate talent for teamwork and a great entrepreneurial mind. Flora is very young and she has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture that it\u2019s only for the older generation. Flora is a proud owner of a small parcel of land on which she has been practicing mixed farming for the past 5 years. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs and some variety of crops she plants. She also engages in some personal business to make ends meet. <br \/><br \/>Flora passionately loves farming and she says that she got interested in farming out of a desire to be a solution to food security that remains a thorn in the flesh for all the farmers in Nkubu and Africa as a whole. From farming, she has been able to earn a decent income and she attributes all this success to hard work and determination. Although she makes profits, she has always wanted to increase her farming and start a cereal-selling business. The main challenge she has been facing is lack of funds. She is seeking a loan to buy cereals.

With the help of her beloved husband, Leah runs a successful rural enterprise, capitalizing on her small piece of land. The farm consists of her home, a cow, poultry, and trees. <br \/><br \/>Leah is planning to grow her farm business, but the only way she can do this without having to purchase more land is by focusing on poultry. Poultry farming is a very lucrative venture that does not require very much land space to be conducted. Leah is kindly seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to purchase more heads of poultry in a bid to boost egg production and ultimately increase her income.

She lives with her family on a small piece of land. Traditionally, her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops, a personal business, and  she has been practicing farming for the past 13 years. Having done farming for such a long time she has gained so much experience that she is always ranked the best farmer in her village. Kenyans drink a lot of milk. This tradition is probably derived from tribal culture - particularly the Nandi tribe (Jeniffer\u2019s tribe) - where cows represent wealth. <br \/><br \/>Demand for dairy milk has been high and Jeniffer wants to take advantage of the market. Therefore, she is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Through the loan, Jeniffer will not only benefit from milk, but will also benefit from manure that will be used in improving the fertility of her farm, thus saving money that would have been spent buying fertilizer. <br \/><br \/>Jeniffer has been facing challenges in accessing finances, but feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, are there to make her dream come true. Jeniffer chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loan is low and is on a reducing basis. Jeniffer underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and during the training season she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro finance institutions. Through accumulated profits Jeniffer plans to permanently improve her living conditions, and to secure the future of her school-aged children by paying tuition fees for them. She plans that through increased income, she will be able to buy more dairy cows and build a bio-gas digester, and hence save costs incurred in buying fuel.<br \/>You can participate in making her dream a reality by making a loan today!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":42.29,"image":{"id":1951086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality breed of dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-18T00:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-17T00:20:05Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jeniffer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":32050,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2268.27},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2334.56},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2402.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2473.01},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2545.28},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2619.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2696.23},{"due_date":"2016-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2775.02},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2856.12},{"due_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2939.6},{"due_date":"2016-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3025.5},{"due_date":"2016-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3113.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.37},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.34},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.14},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.96},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.81},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":42.29,"local_amount":4170.06,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:48Z","rounded_local_amount":4283.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112222}],"funded_date":"2015-09-10T17:59:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":929772,"name":"Lydia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lydia is an enterprising woman, a dreamer, a creative person who, with only a little, has achieved great things.

Lucia is married and blessed with three lovely children who she refers to as \u201cmy heart beat.\u201d Her primary sources of income are milk selling, poultry farming, and some personal business that she does to supplement her meager income. Deciding to practice Poultry farming for Lucia was not difficult because her parents have been doing poultry since she was young. <br \/><br \/>For the past five years, Lucia has been earning a decent income from poultry farming. However, the demand is overwhelming and she wants to increase her poultry, but the biggest challenge is lack of funds. She is seeking a loan to purchase additional poultry. Poultry farming has become one of the most important aspects of agriculture in Kenya because it creates business opportunity for entrepreneurs and it\u2019s a kind of business that can never dry up. Poultry farming is a less strenuous activity that is profitable. Many poultry farmers find a sense of fulfillment having hens all over their homestead. The hens lay eggs that can be consumed or sold.

Phidah farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kitale, in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. For the past 10 years she has been involved in mixed farming and her main source of income has been growing maize, vegetables, and tomatoes. She also keeps dairy cows and does a side hustle business by operating the only diesel poshomill in her area. Phidah has been able to provide nutritious food for her family.<br \/><br \/>Although she has made profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with the challenge of timely delivery of produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up; \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. Phidah mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that helps aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Phidah is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to market has been a challenge, which is why she has suffered so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price and through this loan Phidah is going to achieve her dream and goals. <br \/><br \/>Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle but Phidah feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help women so that they can gain respect and equality. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Phidah will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market and also, she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. She is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farm work.

Her biggest challenges are diseases and the shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs, such as chemicals, to prevent these diseases. <br \/><br \/>Margaret made a decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help her improve her farming activities. <br \/><br \/>Sometime this month, she applied for a loan to buy seeds and expand her horticultural farm. This will enable her to expand her operations to increase the overall output. <br \/><br \/>The additional income from the expansion will go to her children's education.

With the little time Risper has, she sells crops from their small farm and also keeps dairy cows and poultry. From Kiva lenders, Risper is seeking a loan worth 20,000 KES to grow her horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. <br \/><br \/>While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector.

She is tenacious and very determined. Faced with unemployment, she decided to start practicing farming 10 years ago. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kenyenya, in the Nyanza region of Kenya. <br \/><br \/>Dorica is happily married and blessed with a lovely family. For the past 10 years she has been involved in mixed farming and her main source of income has been growing tea, maize, vegetables and tomatoes. She also keeps dairy cows. <br \/><br \/>Dorica has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. Although she has made profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with the challenge of timely delivery of produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up; \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. Dorica mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that helps aspiring women like her. <br \/><br \/>She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. <br \/><br \/>Dorica is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to market has been a challenge, which is why she has suffered so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price, and through this loan Dorica is going to achieve her dream and goals. <br \/><br \/>Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Dorica feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva, that help women so that they can gain respect and equality. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Dorica will never suffer losses due to a delay in the delivery of produce to the market and also, she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. She is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farm work. <br \/><br \/>With your loan, she will improve her living conditions and assure her school-going children and of a secure future.<br \/><br \/>With your support Dorica will be able to fulfill her dreams, so please help her by making a loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100.89,"image":{"id":1955438,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kenyenya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-18T00:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-17T00:40:17Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dorica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4954.1},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5098.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5247.9},{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5401.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5559.12},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5721.59},{"due_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5888.8},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6060.9},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6238.03},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6420.35},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6607.97},{"due_date":"2016-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6801.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.99},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.01},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.59},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.22},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.89},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.61},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.38},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.2},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.08},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52.95,"local_amount":5295.21,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:18Z","rounded_local_amount":5359.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024216},{"amount":47.94,"local_amount":4793.83,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":4852.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112253}],"funded_date":"2015-09-11T00:54:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":925296,"name":"Crecer Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria contin\u00faa con su negocio de venta de comida tradicional.

This food is distinguished by the use of local foods like yucca and organs like intestine, kidney, tongue, heart, etc. She runs her business from Monday to Sunday for lunch and dinner. \"Thanks to their help I have been able to improve my business and my income.

The advantage of her business is that sales have improved and are daily and her disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy cooking supplies like oil, noodles, rice, yucca, meat, etc. <br \/><br \/>Her dream is to provide her family with comfort. She wants to make the purchase of cooking supplies to have constant work material.

Kenya. Listening to her referring to the different breeds of dairy cows on her compound; one would mistake her with a certified Agricultural Extension Officer. Traditionally, her primary source of income has been eggs, crops, and a personal business. She has been practicing farming for the past 11 years. Having done farming for such a long time, she has gained so much experience that she is always ranked the best farmer in her village. Kenyans drink a lot of milk. This tradition is probably derived from tribal culture - particularly the Kikuyu tribe (Catherine\u2019s tribe). Demand for dairy milk has been high and Catherine wants to take advantage of the market. <br \/><br \/>Therefore, she is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is another profitable agricultural venture in Kenya and Catherine has already identified the breed of dairy cow that she wants. Catherine always says that, \u201cTo become a successful dairy farmer, one does not need to be a livestock expert. All one needs is passion, information, and keenness to learn from the successful farmers.\u201d<br \/><br \/> She has planted so many trees on her farm that food for the cattle will never be a problem. Marketing of the dairy milk and dairy products will not be a challenge, because she will sell the milk directly to the market and also to big dairy processing firms. Through the loan, Catherine will not only benefit from milk, but will also benefit from manure that will be used in improving the fertility of her farm, thus saving money that would have been spent buying fertilizer. <br \/><br \/>Catherine has been facing challenges in accessing finances, but feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, are there to make her dream come true. Catherine chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loans is low and is on a reducing basis. Catherine underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and during the training session, she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro finance institutions. Through accumulated profits, Catherine plans to permanently improve her living conditions. She plans that through increased income, she will be able to buy more dairy cows and build a bio-gas digester, hence saving costs incurred in buying fuel."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":99.87,"image":{"id":1955557,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality breed of dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-18T00:50:20Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-17T00:50:20Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2016-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2016-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2016-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2016-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2016-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.7},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.3},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.65},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.95},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.64},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":99.87,"local_amount":9986.66,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:19Z","rounded_local_amount":10162.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024219}],"funded_date":"2015-09-10T17:40:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":932252,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virginia is 57 years old, widow with four children.

From Kiva lenders, <br \/><br \/>Martha is seeking a loan worth 30,000 KES to buy seeds and grow her horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government of Kenya takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to give Martha access to a loan facility that will aid her to grow her horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With your loan, Martha\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability.

She is happily married, and together with her husband, is blessed with a lovely and cute family. For the past seven years, she has been practicing mixed farming, and, because of the experience she has, she commands a lot of respect from fellow farmers and is regarded as a mentor. Income from operating a mixed farm, selling milk, eggs, and maize has allowed her to earn a decent income. Vivian passionately loves dairy farming, and animals on her farm have been given names. Vivian has been actively engaged in mixed farming. She sells her farm\u2019s produce at a local market near her home. Her in-depth knowledge of her environment has enabled Vivian to get her hands on numerous small business opportunities. Vivian is seeking a loan to purchase more poultry. <br \/><br \/>She is very passionate about poultry farming. The most enjoyable task to her is raising poultry.

She is dedicated and responsible, and knows how to use her skills as a farmer. Although a humble woman, she is creative and knows how to make the most of opportunities. She lives in Sangalo, a remote village in Eldoret area of Kenya. She is happily married and is blessed with four adorable children. <br \/><br \/>She has been practicing mixed farming for the last six years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk and a variety of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. The Eldoret area is very populated, so demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable. She stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. <br \/><br \/>She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, so she is seeking a loan of KES 30,000 to buy poultry. Being a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry.

She lives with her partner. She has a 12 year old son and a 14 year old daughter, and her business is to produce stucco. She is a good mother, strong, striving, constant, active, responsible and very hardworking. She works in the province of \u2018Vichaya\u2019, characterized by its Aymara demographic composition and its archeological wealth, with its huge and diverse funeral buildings, chullpares, that are still present after hundreds of years, which have in their interior relics and human remains of the different cultures that passed through this land. Here, the weather is cold and dry, with temperatures ranging between 0-12 degrees Celsius. Nieves is dark skinned, with brown eyes, long black hair which she uses braided; short and stocky. She dresses in a traditional way (hat, shawl and skirt). Her native language is Aymara, which is spoken in the area, and Spanish because of general culture and in her business. She shares her life with her partner who works in the same business, and with her children who attend school and work in the business. They live in their own room, built in adobe and straw with corrugated iron roof and dirt floor, with electricity. To get water she has to go to the river. Her business is to produce stucco, a fine grain composed by lime, powder marble, plaster, natural pigments, etc. that gets hard when mixed with water. It is used to cover walls and roofs. \"Stucco production is a very tiring job. The whole family helps and works in the business...\", she comments. The advantage of the business is her customers' demand. The disadvantage is the lack of water and fuel to work. Her dream is to consolidate her business. She wants to furnish her business through the purchase of coal and fuel to exploit stucco. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 15 years she has been developing this activity independently. These are the reasons why Nieves is requesting a loan to buy coal and fuel for stucco exploitation in order to consolidate her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":320.54,"image":{"id":1943965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction Supplies","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy coal and fuel for stucco exploitation in order to consolidate her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-08-18T02:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-17T02:10:05Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Unique"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nieves","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-11T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-05T04:00:00Z","amount":109.88},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T04:00:00Z","amount":99.01},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T04:00:00Z","amount":111.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T04:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T04:00:00Z","amount":114.19},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T04:00:00Z","amount":122.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T04:00:00Z","amount":125.13},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T04:00:00Z","amount":130.18},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T04:00:00Z","amount":136.92},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T04:00:00Z","amount":141.51},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T04:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T04:00:00Z","amount":151.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.01},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.65},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.13},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.18},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.92},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141.51},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.25},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":111.01,"local_amount":111.01,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:32:00Z","rounded_local_amount":111.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711469095},{"amount":97.99,"local_amount":97.99,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:17:47Z","rounded_local_amount":97.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296952},{"amount":111.54,"local_amount":111.54,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:07:13Z","rounded_local_amount":111.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752077085}],"funded_date":"2015-08-21T18:31:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Mueller","image":null}},{"id":932890,"name":"Diadema","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Diadema is a 39-year-old married woman with four children, three of whom are currently in school.

She has always strived to give them a decent life and a good education. <br \/><br \/>For the past 25 years, she has been involved in mixed farming and she grows maize and vegetables. She also has dairy cows. Priscilla has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with the challenge of delivering the produce in a timely manner to the market. This challenge has not made her give up, and she states: \u201cI have to do something for my family.\" <br \/><br \/>Priscilla joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Priscilla is from a remote village that has poor roads, and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables, and tomatoes) which require timely delivery to the market. This loan will help Priscilla to achieve her dream and reach her goals. <br \/><br \/>Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Priscilla feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help women to gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Priscilla will never suffer losses due to delay in delivering produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. Her income will increase. Priscilla is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike and help with farm work. Priscilla will use the loan to improve her living conditions and assure her children of a secure future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":166.82,"image":{"id":1952717,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-18T03:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-17T03:20:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Priscilla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2016-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2016-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.39},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.42},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.58},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.71},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.87},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.06},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.29},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.56},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.86},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.2},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":166.82,"local_amount":16682.33,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:11Z","rounded_local_amount":16868.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024180}],"funded_date":"2015-09-12T09:24:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":926611,"name":"Evaristo Florentino","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Evaristo contin\u00faa con su negocio de producci\u00f3n de estuco.

Sharon mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. <br \/><br \/>She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Sharon is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge, hence she has suffered so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if they are to fetch a high price, and through this loan Sharon is going to achieve her dream and goals. <br \/><br \/>Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle but Sharon feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help out women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts.

Increased income from this intervention will help Losalina to scale up her business and improve the quality of life being led by her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":133.61,"image":{"id":1953464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorcycle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-18T03:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-17T03:30:09Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Losalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":95000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4085.77},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4205.18},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4328.08},{"due_date":"2015-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4454.57},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4584.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4718.74},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4856.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4998.58},{"due_date":"2016-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5144.66},{"due_date":"2016-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5295.02},{"due_date":"2016-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5449.76},{"due_date":"2016-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5609.03},{"due_date":"2016-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5772.96},{"due_date":"2016-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5941.67},{"due_date":"2016-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":6115.32},{"due_date":"2016-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":6294.04},{"due_date":"2016-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":6477.93},{"due_date":"2017-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":6667.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.86},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.05},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.85},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.19},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.57},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.98},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.45},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.95},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.5},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.09},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.73},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.42},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.15},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.94},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.78},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":92.62,"local_amount":9261.82,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:12Z","rounded_local_amount":9365.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024183},{"amount":40.99,"local_amount":4099.46,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4145.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112232}],"funded_date":"2015-09-14T19:45:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":924881,"name":"Nancy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A large percentage of the people living in Kenya, particularly the Kerugoya area of Kenya, are poor, with the women bearing the brunt of it.

The above picture presents to you Nancy, 39 years of age. She is very ambitious and enterprising, and a go-getting woman who hails from the Kerugoya area of Kenya.

Nancy wants to take advantage of this and start horticultural farming. She is seeking a loan to buy seeds and start horticulture farming. Through improved income she will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her family. The financial benefits that Nancy will reap are almost immediate, and hence she will be assured of a secure future.

He is a husband, grandfather, and father who is a mixed small-scale farmer based in the remote village of Gitumbi, Kerugoya. He has been practicing agribusiness for the past 20 years and has never looked back. To earn a living, Joseph sells milk and food products from his farm into the local market. He makes extra money doing a side hustle business. He enjoys seeing clients coming back for more of his products and he really feels satisfied. <br \/><br \/>Although Joseph has been making profits through farming, he has always wanted to do poultry farming. The main challenge he has encountered is a lack of funds to get his business off the ground. Joseph is seeking a loan to buy quality breeds of poultry. Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in Kerugoya and is a business that can be done on a part-time basis to earn extra income. Joseph does not worry too much about competition because the market for poultry products is good; chicken is a popular meal for many people and this can be seen if you visit any fast food joint. <br \/><br \/>With this loan, Joseph is confident that his income will increase and this will allow a permanent change in his life. He plans to buy different breeds of broilers and layers and will be selling eggs and meat to the local market and other major markets in Kenya. He also plans to start breeding, which will help increase the number of poultry on his farm. Other than profits from selling eggs, poultry feathers, and poultry meat, Joseph will also benefit from using the poultry manure, which is an excellent source of nutrients for his farm. Through this loan, he will assure his large family a secure future and improved living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":139.28,"image":{"id":1943694,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-18T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-17T04:40:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2016-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.7},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.65},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.95},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.64},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":97.4,"local_amount":9739.84,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:33:49Z","rounded_local_amount":9960.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024056},{"amount":41.88,"local_amount":4188.42,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:38Z","rounded_local_amount":4283.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112165}],"funded_date":"2015-09-14T18:07:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":925084,"name":"Evans","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evans comes from a remote village found in the Kitale area of Kenya.

She wakes up every day to go to work and care for her land. This is a skill that she learned on her own, and little by little, she has perfected her techniques and abilities in this field. Eunice is dedicated in full to her work. This mum only thinks about going forward and delivering good produce. She knows that many people consume her farm products, and because of this, she makes sure her products are pure and of good quality. <br \/><br \/>She is a 45-year-old farmer from Cbebiemit village, situated in the Rift valley province of Kenya. She lives with her family on a small piece of land where she keeps cows and grows a wide variety of crops. For 10 years, her primary sources of income have been milk and produce. Her biggest challenges are diseases and the shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs, such as chemicals, to prevent these diseases. Eunice made a decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help her improve her farming activities. <br \/><br \/>Sometime last month, she applied for a loan to buy seeds and expand her horticultural farm. This will enable her to expand her operations to increase the overall output. The additional income from the expansion will go to her children's education. The cost of education in Kenya is increasingly becoming prohibitive to low-income communities, especially in the rural areas.

She invested her previous loan in the purchase of an industrial oven. Her loan payments were punctual because her business did not have any problems (she is in the middle of the photo, wearing a brown sweater and carrying a baby). \r\n\r\nAt this time she met with her communal bank to request a loan to improve her business. The businesses in the communal bank are: tire repair shop, sale of bathroom articles, sale of desserts, production of bedsheets, sale of lamb meat, sale of fruits, leather artisan goods and sale of natural medical products. Her business continues improving, her menu is more varied and also the quantity of customers and sales has improved. \"My business is growing, the new dishes on the menu have attracted more customers and I lose sales because I don't have tables where I can serve them,\" she says. The advantage of her business is that she makes sales daily. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy tables and chairs to serve more customers.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to improve her food stand.

Her business is selling plastic utensils. She is enterprising, independent, generous, optimistic, kind, responsible and very hard-working. She works in the '21 de octubre' area where new domestic gas supplies have just recently been connected. The area has a cold dry climate with a temperature which varies between 0-12 degrees Centigrade during the day. <br \/><br \/>Daisy has a dark complexion, brown eyes and long black hair which she wears in a plait. She is short and of medium build. Her mother tongue is Aymara which she speaks within the family and she speaks Spanish for general purposes and for carrying out her business. She shares her life with her parents who work independently. They live in a house belonging to the family which is built from brick and cement with a corrugated metal roof. It has electricity, a drinking water and domestic gas supply and a sewer connection. <br \/><br \/>Daisy's business is selling plastic items such as plates, cutlery, bottles, containers etc. \"Now it would be difficult to imagine that some aspects of our daily life, from the economy to technology, would be possible without plastics. We only have to look around us and analyse how many objects are made of plastic to see the economic importance that these materials have...\" she says. <br \/><br \/>Alongside her business she is studying a course in gastronomy at night. The advantage of her business is that it is situated in a commercial area while the disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy plastic plates and cups wholesale. Her dream is to establish herself in the market and finish her studies. She wants to buy plastic plates and cups wholesale and pay for her study books with the profits. This is the first loan cycle with the institution in the 5 years she has been doing this work independently. These are the reasons why Daisy is asking for a loan, to buy plastic plates and cups wholesale and pay for her studies with the profits."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675.44,"image":{"id":1945701,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy plastic plates and cups wholesale and pay for her studies with the profits.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-08-18T08:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-17T08:50:02Z","loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daisy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-13T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":1491.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":1523.26},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":1583.09},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":1669.32},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T04:00:00Z","amount":1732.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":223.73},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":245.18},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":219.2,"local_amount":1492.44,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T14:32:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1514.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711469097},{"amount":223.72,"local_amount":1523.18,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1545.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296962},{"amount":232.52,"local_amount":1583.1,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1606.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752077095}],"funded_date":"2015-08-18T14:06:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judith McInally","image":null}},{"id":930434,"name":"D\u00e9d\u00e9","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"D\u00e9d\u00e9 est une femme mari\u00e9e \u00e2g\u00e9e de 31 ans qui vit \u00e0 Baguida avec ses  deux enfants.

Jane is happily married and is blessed with a lovely family. For the past 15 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and she grows maize and vegetables. She also has dairy cows. \r\n\r\nJane has been able to provide nutritious food for her family.

This challenge has not made her give up and she states: \u201cI have to do something for my family.\"\r\n\r\nJane joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She requests a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Jane is from a remote village that has poor roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables, and tomatoes) that require timely delivery to the market. \r\n\r\nThis loan will help Jane to achieve her dream and reach her goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Jane feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help women to gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Jane will never suffer losses due to delay in delivering produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. Her income will increase. \r\n\r\nJane is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike and help with farm work. Jane will use the loan to improve her living conditions and assure her children of a secure future. You can be part of this dream.

Su negocio es la venta de golosinas y l\u00e1cteos en su kiosco como; gaseosas, refrescos, agua embotellada, dulces, papas fritas, man\u00ed, chocolates, galletas, etc. \u201canteriormente vend\u00eda dulces de forma ambulante y tambi\u00e9n vend\u00eda electrodom\u00e9sticos, cansada de transportar cajas pesadas cambie de actividad y ahora tengo mi kiosco propio\u2026\u201d comenta. La ventaja de su negocio es que se encuentra bien ubicado y las ventas son constantes, la desventaja es la falta de capital para la compra de mercader\u00eda surtida para su kiosco. Su sue\u00f1o es mejorar su capital de trabajo, ella desea realizar la compra de mercader\u00eda surtida para abastecer su kiosco y poder trabajar. Esta es la 2 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 1 a\u00f1o que se dedica a esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Gregoria solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de golosinas y refrescos para abastecer su kiosco y continuar trabajando.\n","en":"Gregoria is a 40-year-old woman, married, has a 24-year-old son, and her business is selling candies and dairy products in her kiosk.<br \/><br \/>She is a good mother, enterprising, independent, reliable, responsible, and very hard-working. Her business is in the El Prado zone, characterized by housing public and private businesses, where there is a lot of commercial and social movement. It has a cold and dry climate with a temperature that varies during the day between 0-12 degrees centigrade.<br \/><br \/>Gregoria has dark skin, dark eyes, long black hair she wears braided, is short, has a thin physique, she dresses traditionally (hat, shawl, and pollera [traditional Andean skirt]), her native language is Aymar\u00e1 which she speaks locally and she speaks Spanish due to the general culture and for the business she does. She shares her life with her husband who works in transportation and with her son who goes to school and works. They live in their own room built of brick and cement with a roof of metal sheeting and a cement floor which has drinking water, electricity and sewer services. Previously, she worked selling household appliances, she was able to sell all of her merchandise and purchase a kiosk in the center of the city. Her business is selling candies and dairy products in her kiosk such as soft drinks, bottled water, candies, french fries, peanuts, chocolates, cookies, etc. \"Before, I sold sweets as a street vendor and I also sold household appliances. Tired from carrying heavy boxes, I changed my business and now I have my own kiosk...\" she says. <br \/><br \/>The advantage of her business is that it is well-situated and the sales are constant, the disadvantage is the lack of capital to purchase an assortment of merchandise to stock her kiosk and be able to work. This is her 2nd loan cycle with the institution in the 1 year she has done this work. <br \/><br \/>For these reasons, Gergoria asks for a loan to purchase candies and soft drinks to stock her kiosk and continue working."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1947538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

For this reason, Gladis is asking for this loan from Soluz Honduras to purchase a solar-powered freezer, which will help her to serve her customers better and, above all, she no longer will spend money on the purchase of ice and won't have to travel great distances to get it, and in this way her business will increase in earnings and her customers will be satisfied."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":237.51,"image":{"id":1949268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Innovative Loans","Green"],"use":"to purchase a solar-powered freezer which will help her to serve her customers better and will increase the earnings of her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Colon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":390,"posted_date":"2015-08-18T12:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-17T12:20:02Z","loan_amount":3375,"lender_count":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":74000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":3375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2584.38},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2623.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2662.49},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2702.43},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2742.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2784.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2825.87},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2868.26},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2911.28},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2954.95},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2999.28},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3044.27},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3089.93},{"due_date":"2016-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3136.28},{"due_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3183.32},{"due_date":"2016-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3231.07},{"due_date":"2017-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3279.54},{"due_date":"2017-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3328.73},{"due_date":"2017-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3378.66},{"due_date":"2017-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3429.34},{"due_date":"2017-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3480.78},{"due_date":"2017-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3533},{"due_date":"2017-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3585.99},{"due_date":"2017-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3639.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.64},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.1},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.98},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.88},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.82},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.78},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.77},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.79},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.84},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.93},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.04},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.19},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.36},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.57},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.82},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.09},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.41},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.75},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.13},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.55},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":117.87,"local_amount":2584.38,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:08:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2584.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731169921},{"amount":119.64,"local_amount":2623.15,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:32:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2623.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752258337}],"funded_date":"2015-08-18T15:47:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Wendy Harris","image":null}},{"id":930716,"name":"Luis Emmanuel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Luis Emmnauel es un joven estudiante de Licenciatura en Administracion de empresas, \u00e9l solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para poder cubrir sus gastos educativo, esta es su historia: Mi nombre es Luis Emmanuel, vivo en San Pedro de Macor\u00eds, Rep.

That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plough. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. <br \/><br \/>Kenya's Chuka area, one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Poline could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. Accessing funds has been a challenge for Poline, but she now feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. <br \/><br \/>Poline believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Poline to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children.<br \/><br \/>Like Poline, many entrepreneurs await for your help. Get inspired, make a loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":67.35,"image":{"id":1955901,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cereals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-18T12:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-17T12:30:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Poline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3244.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3339.18},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3436.76},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3537.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3640.58},{"due_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3746.97},{"due_date":"2016-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3856.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3969.19},{"due_date":"2016-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4085.19},{"due_date":"2016-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4204.57},{"due_date":"2016-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4327.45},{"due_date":"2016-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4453.98},{"due_date":"2016-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4584.09},{"due_date":"2016-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4718.06},{"due_date":"2016-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4855.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.39},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.37},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.41},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.47},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.57},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.69},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.85},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.05},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.27},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.54},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.18},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.56,"local_amount":3655.65,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3720.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024226},{"amount":30.79,"local_amount":3078.89,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3133.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112263}],"funded_date":"2015-09-13T22:53:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":930558,"name":"Azangounoss","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Veuve de 53 ans, Azangounoss est une femme habitant \u00e0 Tokoin avec ses quatre enfants \u00e0 charge.

She discovered that being a smallholder farmer gave her a way out of her economic problems, because it is very difficult to find work in the Kapsowar area of Kenya. <br \/><br \/>Regina has defied the common thinking of many Kenyans that agriculture is not a profitable venture. Regina is a lovely mother who has been farming for the last 10 years to supplement her income from the small business she does. Regina does crop farming and cattle raising and she enjoys farming a lot. Her biggest challenges are animal diseases and the lack of finances to improve her farming. <br \/><br \/>Regina is seeking a loan of KES 30,000 to purchase sheep. Her projections are that, by the end of the year, these sheep will have given birth to at least four lambs. Through sheep-raising, she will be able to get sheep wool, which is very expensive and fetches good profits. This translates into more income and improved living conditions for her family. Also, she will be able to sell sheep meat and sheepskin, which will increase her income level. The profits will be used to repay the loan on time and to grow the

region of Kenya. Alice owns a small parcel of land. On the farm, she practices mixed farming.

She is very hardworking and determined to increase her farm's output. Loans for smallholder farmers with little irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. Few organizations such as Juhudi Kilimo support farmers like Alice. Through a group of 15 members called Simotwet Elite, Alice has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi, which use the group-based savings as collateral. <br \/><br \/>According to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled. In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household. Juhudi Kilimo facilitates loans that empower smallholder farmers like Alice because the institution believes that women too are actively involved in various segments of the horticultural industry.<br \/>Support the dream of Alice, be inspired, make a loan!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":66.48,"image":{"id":1953772,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy seeds and start horticulture farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kericho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-18T14:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-17T14:30:06Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3184.78},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3277.85},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3373.65},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3472.24},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3573.72},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3678.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3785.65},{"due_date":"2016-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3896.29},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4010.16},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4127.36},{"due_date":"2016-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4247.98},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4372.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.74},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.74},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.78},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.86},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.1},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.48},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.48,"local_amount":6648.46,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:15Z","rounded_local_amount":6721.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024198}],"funded_date":"2015-09-13T20:10:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":931207,"name":"Margaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello, lenders.

She is hardworking,honest, charismatic and cheerful, and has a very good sense of humour. These qualities have been her inspiration to work hard on her farm. With children to raise, water to fetch, and food to cook, Paulina has little time to make money to financially support her family. With the little time Paulina has left, she sells crops from the family's small farm and also keeps dairy cows and poultry. <br \/><br \/>Paulina is seeking a loan of 50,000 Kenyan shillings from Kiva lenders. She will use the loan to buy seeds and grow her horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by steadily rising exports. Although experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that people with small farms and poor farmers are included in the opportunities in this market sector. <br \/><br \/>It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to give Paulina access to a loan.

Rose is a mother of five lovely children that she really adores so much and will always do anything good so that they never go to bed with hungry stomachs. Rose hails from the Kitale area of Kenya. <br \/><br \/>Rose started farming and has been doing farming for the past twenty eight years. Throughout those years, she has gathered so much experience and all the farming techniques are at her fingertips. Rose practices mixed farming on her farm and through the profits, she has managed to take care of her family's needs and give her children a good education because she believes that education is the only \u201ckey to success\u201d. <br \/><br \/>She is seeking a loan of KES 35,000 to buy seeds and start horticulture farming on her farm. Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in her village, good soil and a ready market for horticulture products, Rose wants to take advantage of that and reap more profits. Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring women like Rose to make their farming dreams come to reality through training and loan financing. Rose hopes that through the loan, she will improve her living conditions. Rose's dreams and projections are that by the end of the first year, she will not only be selling in the local market but will also be selling in international markets through exporting fruits and vegetables. Through this, she will be able to assure her children a secure future and uninterrupted learning because she will be able to pay tuition fees on time. Rose is not a selfish mum and will also want to impact positively on society. That is why she will employ people to work for him on her horticulture farm, hence having an impact on society.<br \/>Her biggest dream is to give her children a good education and a comfortable life.<br \/>For this reason, she is turning to Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders for their help."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":51.5,"image":{"id":1953865,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To start horticulture farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-18T14:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-17T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2477.05},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2549.45},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2623.95},{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2700.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2779.57},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2860.8},{"due_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2944.4},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.45},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3119.02},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3210.17},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3303.99},{"due_date":"2016-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":3400.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":51.5,"local_amount":5150.42,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:15Z","rounded_local_amount":5207.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024199}],"funded_date":"2015-08-19T16:47:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":930721,"name":"Rosa Nelly","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa, utiliza los cr\u00e9ditos que le otorgan Padecomsm y Kiva para mejorar la venta de antojitos y gallinas, se siente satisfecha por los buenos resultados que le dan, manifiesta tener mejores ingresos con los que cubre necesidades b\u00e1sicas de su familia y logro hacer reparaciones importantes a su vivienda.\nNuevamente solicita un cr\u00e9dito para comprar papas, yuca, ma\u00edz, frijol, aceite, etc., para elaborar la venta de antojitos, el resto lo invertir\u00e1 en gallinas, surtir\u00e1 el inventario de su negocio para continuar trabajando.\n","en":"Rosa has used the loans extended by Padecomsm and Kiva to enhance her sales of snacks and chickens.

Through a group of 15 members called Shikulu, Elizabeth has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi, which use the group-based savings as collateral. According to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled. In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household. Juhudi Kilimo facilitates loans that empower smallholder farmers like Elizabeth because the institution believes that women too are actively involved in various segments of the horticultural industry.

As a woman, accessing funds is very challenging but, through institutions such as Juhudi, via Kiva, she feels relieved to know that her dream will be achieved, and that she will be able to buy more poultry. As a result of this loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbours and to the local market. These sales will translate into increased profit margins and an improved income level.

Pauline is one of the strong and hardworking dairy farmers who start their work early in the morning (5 o\u2019clock) to make that cup of milk possible. Pauline has one child.

She always believed that was best for her. <br \/><br \/>Pauline is a smallholder farmer from Chuka, Kenya, which she has been doing for nine years. Like many farmers in the region, she keeps a dairy cow. Chuka has a thriving market for dairy products. She enjoys the farming lifestyle. She has a connection with farm animals. <br \/><br \/>Pauline dreams of expanding her dairy farm, but due to financial constraints, she has been unable to do so until now. She is requesting a loan for 65,000 KES, which she will use to purchase a high yielding dairy cow. This cow will boost milk production on the farm. As a result, she will have more milk for both consumption and sales. With the money from the additional sales, she will be able to repay her loan on time and cover the high farming cost of production. Many farmers compromise quality because of the high cost of inputs. However, with increased income, Pauline will not take such measures. In the long run, her family will realize an improved standard of living. <br \/><br \/>By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets.

She says she began with one table, 10 glasses, one icebox, and four benches. <br \/><br \/>With the passing of time and the prestige of her business, she was able to set up a location within the market thanks to the additional profits she obtained from integrating the sale of chocolate milk and breakfast.  From 7 in the morning the curtain of her place is open so that her customers can enjoy a rich breakfast, and during the day a delicious seafood cocktail.  She says that the idea of starting this job arose from the demand she saw in the market's stalls when she went to buy groceries.<br \/><br \/>The loans that she has received have been useful.  She invested each one of them in the purchase of shrimp, crab, octopus, sauces, lemon, avocado, dough, cream, cheese, oil, sodas, and napkins.  With the profits she moved the property, and in the same way was able to open another seafood cocktail business.  It is located on the highway and is tended to by her husband.  <br \/><br \/>This time the loan will be used to buy shrimp, crab, octopus, oysters, milk, plantains, and sugar in such a way that will allow her to satisfy her customers.  For Do\u00f1a Aurea the customers are most important, and because of this she always serves them with a smile on her face and treats them kindly as well as with quality service.  \"To achieve what we have now has been the result of effort and work.

Through the loan, Edina will be assured of a bumper harvest, and this will translate into more profits and cash. Through the use of good seeds and fertilizer, Edina will reap more, which will assure her of comfortably taking care of her family and repaying the loan.

Mrs. Tam is also satisfied with the training and counselling provided by the program, which has helped her constantly overcome the difficulties in cultivation and animal husbandry and make the production more efficient. <br \/><br \/>She hopes that her investment this time will go successfully just like previous ones so that she could provide better for her family. <br \/><br \/>Mrs. Tam dreams that her family will have a more abundant life and her children will have good job with bright future. In the picture, she stands at the first from the right."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1957005,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to have enough money to buy a buffalo to develop her farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"VN","country":"Vietnam","town":"Dien Bien","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.166667 107.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":342,"posted_date":"2015-08-18T16:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-17T16:20:05Z","loan_amount":2175,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" In","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Nhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Don","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Panh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Quy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Thieu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Tam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Oanh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"VND","disbursal_amount":47000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":2175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":47000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-09-10T17:27:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":930745,"name":"Emperatriz Elena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Emperatriz, es viuda, vive en casa propia con una hija, dos hijos m\u00e1s ya son independientes; sus ingresos provienen de atender un chalet en el que vende pupusas, bebidas, comida, golosinas, etc., adem\u00e1s recibe una pensi\u00f3n mensual, inicio su negocio en el 2013, lo ha ido ampliando con las ganancias obtenidas, el negocio lo tiene ubicado en la unidad de salud de su  localidad, trabaja de seis de la ma\u00f1ana a cuatro de la tarde.\nCon el prop\u00f3sito de tener mejores ganancias solicita un cr\u00e9dito para comprar bebidas, ma\u00edz, harina, arroz, frijoles, quesillo, aceite, etc., al por mayor para adquirir los productos a menor precio y elaborar siempre la venta de comida y pupusas, espera saber administrar el cr\u00e9dito y resarcirlo sin problemas.\nSus sue\u00f1os son mantener su negocio, ofrecer mercader\u00eda m\u00e1s variada y ense\u00f1ar a su hija la administraci\u00f3n del mismo.\n","en":"Emperatriz is a widow.
