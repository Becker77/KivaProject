This group of 3, led by Ranjitha, living in Kulithalai in the state of Tamil Nadu has understood the importance of having a toilet at home. But they do not have the means to build one. With no access to a toilet, her family has to walk long distances to answer nature's call in private: in dense bushes or isolated fields. The women and girls, seeking privacy, often resort to waking up before sunrise to relieve themselves. They are subsequently at risk of infection, molestation, and insect or animal bites. <br \/><br \/>So, taking advantage of the awareness initiatives, the group now seeks a loan of Rs. 42000 to build toilets in their homes. As they begin to enjoy the benefits of basic sanitation and their families improve in health, they will be able to save on medical expenses.

el se\u00f1or  Rufino quien trabaja en el campo desde que era un adolescente, actualmente de ellos depende un nieto de 12 a\u00f1os, desde hace 8 a\u00f1os cuando su nieto llego a casa fue la

m\u00e1s grande, a los 6 meses de iniciar con la venta de refresco sus clientes le sugirieron vendiera pan e inicio con una segunda actividad desde entonces de san miguel soyaltepec le llevan diariamente un gran canasto de pan hasta la puerta de su casa.\nAl ver que el pan y los refrescos hicieron buena combinaci\u00f3n y sus ganancias asi lo demostraban decidi\u00f3 construir una palapa (\u00e1rea con techo de palma) para poder colocar el canasto del pan sea temporada de lluvia o de seca, recientemente con las ganancias logro cambiar la palma pues ya estaba deteriorada\n\u201cLos

de su nieto al cual trata y ve como un hijo.\u201d \n\u201cno tenemos las palabras adecuadas para agradecer todo lo que hacen por nosotros al brindarnos un pr\u00e9stamo\u201d son las palabras de

the towns that preserves 90% of its culture and the Mazateco language.  The residents here work in the fields cultivating sugar, corn, and beans.  Others work as fishermen.  Due to financial difficulties and the lack of schools, most of the adults do not know how to write, although it is worth  mentioning that some have put in more effort and have learned to read and write now that they are adults.  In this community, a communal bank has formed named \"La Palapa\" (palm roof), just like the roof that is on Rosa's house.  This group includes Rosa, who formed the group, and sells beverages and bread.  Also included are:\r\nVirginia and, Sof\u00eda \u2013 who sell snacks\r\nHilarina \u2013 who sells roasted chicken, drinks and bread\r\nEsther- who sells drinks and snacks\r\nEligio \u2013 who sells chicken\r\n\r\nRosa is one of the adults who does not know how to read or write.  Over time she has learned to carry out basic operations and change money and bills.  She is married to Rufino, who has been a farmer ever since he was an adolescent. At this time they have a dependent grandson who is 12 years old.  Rosa was inspired to start her business 8 years ago when her grandson came to live with her.  She sells a variety of flavors and sizes of drinks, juices, and mineral water.  With her earnings, she managed to buy a larger refrigerator.  \r\n\r\nSix months after starting her drink business her customers suggested that she sell bread as well, and so she started a second business activity at that time.  Ever since, she goes daily to San Miguel Soyaltepec to carry a large basket of bread back to her house.  Seeing that bread and drinks made a good combination, which improve her profits, she decided to build a palapa (a gazebo with a palm roof) where she could put her basket of bread no matter if it was the rainy or dry season.  Recently, with her earnings, she managed to replace the palm fronds that had deteriorated.\r\n\r\n\"The previous loans that I was granted helped me so that today I have what I have and can continue with my activities,\" are the words of Rosa, who comments that at this time she will invest the loan in the purchase of drinks, juices, and different sized bottles of mineral water.  She states that what is most important is the well-being of her family and her grandson, who she treats and sees as a son. \"Words can't even convey how much we appreciate everything that you are doing for us by providing this loan,\" are the words of some members of the group.\r\n\r\nNote:  in the photograph the members of the \"La Palapa\" communal bank are seen.  Rosa is the one wearing a white and grey striped shirt.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1093.75,"image":{"id":1949317,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy drinks to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Cosolapa Caracol, San Miguel Soyaltepec, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-08-18T17:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-17T17:30:02Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilarina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sofia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eligio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":468.75,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":7626.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701414},{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:58:41Z","rounded_local_amount":5084.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204513},{"amount":312.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":5084.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291934}],"funded_date":"2015-08-19T01:44:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":933186,"name":"Rukhshona","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rukhshona is a clever girl.

Meet Esther, a 33-year-old farmer from the remote village of Koibarak, situated in the Rift valley province of Kenya. The living conditions in this area are tough because there is no clean water nor electrical connections. Esther lives with her lovely family on a small piece of land where she keeps dairy cows and poultry and grows a wide variety of crops. <br \/><br \/>For 10 years, her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs and horticultural produce. Esther's biggest challenges are disease and a shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs such as chemicals to prevent these diseases. Esther made the decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help her improve her farming activities. <br \/><br \/>Sometime this month, she applied for a loan for expanding her horticulture farm. This will enable her to expand her operations and increase her overall output. The additional income from the expansion will go to Esther's children's education.

In the same way, one can appreciate plantings of sugar cane, which indicate the great production of a natural sweetener in the region. In a community that is divided in two by the highway, a group has formed that bears the name \"Las Inocentes\" (The Innocents) because they are pure women.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group and their businesses are: Antonia, soft drinks; Enriqueta, food; Maria, store; Rosalvana, soft drinks and snacks; Alejandra, tortillas; Juana and Karina, shoes; and Margarita, groceries.\r\n\r\nAt her age of 47, Do\u00f1a Margarita is stronger than an oak. In the neighborhood, she is known as Mago. Eight years ago, she decided to set up a little grocery store so that she didn't feel alone and so that she didn't have to depend on her children, since she had just been widowed. Since then she has paid the household expenses with the help of the earnings and the economic support of her children. Do\u00f1a Mago comments that she is very happy with her store, since all day she is busy serving her customers. When her closest friends come to buy, they take advantage of the opportunity to chat.\r\n\r\nIn order to set up the store, she made some modifications. She changed a little door to two panels that open toward the the sides. She bought metal shelves where she displays the merchandise. When the doors are open, it is a symbol that there is service. Even so, if one of her customers needs matches, soup, water, soft drinks, or an air time [cell phone] recharge, she serves them if she is not yet asleep. In the first loan cycle, she invested the loan in the purchase of sugar, rice, beans, detergents, Sabrita [brand] snacks, and crackers.  This time, she will invest in the purchase of beans, soup, eggs, oil, matches, and cheese, since these are the products with the greatest demand.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for making the clients such as myself feel fulfilled in their businesses from making appropriate use of the loans that you offer us to help us continue with our businesses or to begin one.\"\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken outside of Do\u00f1a Mago's store.

Isabella, 27, has been farming for the past 5 years. Through these years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Isabella is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plough. <br \/><br \/>Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by buying seeds so that she can plant them and once the crops are ready for harvest she can sell them. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy seeds for planting. Kenya's Kitale area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for crop produce. This means that Isabella could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. Accessing funds has been a challenge for Isabella, but she now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. <br \/><br \/>Isabella believes that this loan will be of much help and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for crops. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable a permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Isabella to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going

Sirenas (The Mermaids) is the name of the group made up of 8 clients, all of them originating from the same city, belonging to a sugar cane region that also has a lot of cattle raising, where the majority of the people give part of their life to the field. It is important to mention that cattle raising plays an important part in the economy as the production of milk allows there to be cheese producers of various types (Jarocho, Cotija, Hebra and dry). The cheeses are distributed to different communities. <br \/><br \/>The name of the group was chosen due to the mysticism of mermaids. The members are:<br \/>Josefina \u2013 Refreshments<br \/>Maria T\u2013 Cosmetics, Silver and Gold Leaf Costume Jewelery<br \/>Candelaria \u2013 Snacks <br \/>Elia \u2013 In-season Fruit <br \/>Maria C \u2013  Food <br \/>Andrea \u2013 Desserts and shoes <br \/>Itzel \u2013 Domestic items<br \/>Norma \u2013 Cosmetics<br \/><br \/>Mrs. Maria T is 45 years old, everyone knows her as Mari. 25 years ago she established a family with Mr. Esteban, who she had 2 children with, both now of age. Mrs. Mari has always made a living as a street vendor to support her parents and the expenses at home. <br \/>6 years ago she resumed her sale of underwear via catalog thanks to the first loan she was granted. A short time later she decided to change her activity because the income decreased and she began selling cosmetics via catalog. The earnings obtained and one of the loans allowed her to eventually begin selling gold and silver leaf costume jewelery. She travels the streets of the community showing the catalogs, delivering orders and offering bracelets, rings, chains, charms and earrings. <br \/><br \/>\"I like visiting my clients, walking is good for me and especially if I obtain a profit\" says Mrs. Mari who is requesting a new loan to purchase bracelets, earrings, rings, lipsticks, eye shadows and creams that her clients have requested. <br \/><br \/>Her children's well-being and the studies they were able to provide for them were funded by her husbands salary and the profits she acquired. Currently she uses these profits to help her husband with the expenses, cover loan payments and pay for her personal expenses. <br \/><br \/>\"Thank you for believing in us and granting us new loans for our activities through which we are able to improve our quality of life and our family's as well\" are the words of the group \"The Mermaids.\"<br \/><br \/>*the photograph is taken in the patio of Mrs. Josefina's house.

Meet Jane, a 40-year-old farmer from a remote village in Cheptongei in the Kapsowar area of Kenya. She resides with her husband with whom she is blessed with a lovely family. She has been actively involved in farming for the last 12 years and has never regretted or looked back. She practices mixed farming and sells milk, eggs and various food crops at the local market. She passionately loves poultry farming but the biggest challenge she is facing is a lack of capital to buy quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs. <br \/><br \/>She is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase additional poultry. She believes the excess maize she has will be used in feeding the poultry, sorghum will be used in giving the poultry energy and green grams for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs that are of good quality, which will translate to more income. Apart from an increase in egg output, she will get increased output from poultry meat, and this will increase her income and profit margins. Through increased profits, she is going to turn around her living conditions and live a better life. <br \/><br \/>Other than profits, she is going to benefit from chicken manure, which contains the highest amount of nitrogen of any livestock manure and is very valuable as fertilizer. She will save more money that could have been spent in buying fertilizer. Your loan will bring joy to this family because she will be able to support her family and improve her living conditions.<br \/>Thanks to your support, Jane will succeed in making her dreams come true; take action and give a loan!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":46.63,"image":{"id":1957337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-18T19:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-17T19:30:09Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2016-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2016-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.85},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.63,"local_amount":4663.09,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4801.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112268}],"funded_date":"2015-08-19T21:17:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":933338,"name":"Nan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nan, 39, resides in a rural village of Kampong Cham province.

December, in addition to the posadas (processions reenacting Mary and Joseph\u2019s search for a place to stay in Bethlehem), the livestock fair also takes place, in which there are horse races, rodeo, and bullfights are held, to name the most important events, at which the inhabitants of La Novia del Sol (nickname for the city of Tierra Blanca) and neighboring communities gather, although there are also those who come from afar to make an appearance.<br \/><br \/>In the neighborhood where the fairground is located, a group formed to apply for a new loan from Vision F Mexico and invest it in their productive economic occupations. The name of the group is Media Luna. The members of the group are:<br \/>Am\u00e9rica \u2013Food and Shoes <br \/>Hada X -Candy, Soft Drinks, Clothing, Costume Jewelry <br \/>Itzel-Clothing<br \/>Roc\u00edo- Cosmetics and Vegetables<br \/>Jos\u00e9-Clothing and Footwear<br \/>Clara- Shoes<br \/>Hada-Food<br \/>Lluvia, Yadira-Cosmetics <br \/><br \/>Roc\u00edo is married to Iran, with whom she has had two children, ages 12 and 7, who study in the neighborhood\u2019s elementary school. For 4 years Ch\u00edo (Roc\u00edo\u2019s nickname) has worked in catalog cosmetic sales, obtaining 50% of the sales total as profit. She relates that before doing direct sales she was helping her friend, who motivated her to enroll. The profits obtained, the first loan granted and a taste for the country motivated her to start with the planting and sales of vegetables. In addition to obtaining profits from her street sales of the aforementioned products, she no longer spends on purchases for her consumption.<br \/><br \/>Every so often when the vegetables are ready, Ch\u00edo cuts them and arranges them in a wheelbarrow in order to be able to transport them in the quickest manner through the streets of the neighborhood and offer her customers a product 100% organic and fresh. Unfortunately last month the rain ruining her planting. She relates that she has not replanted because the inclement weather can affect her again.

Lucyline has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. After her husband lost his formal job, the role of primary caregiver of the family fell to Lucyline. It has been overwhelming because she now has to shoulder the responsibility of feeding the whole family. This challenge has not made her give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family,\" she said. <br \/><br \/>Lucyline is requesting a loan to buy an additional quality dairy cow and to build a modern dairy unit. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profits and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used in repaying the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. <br \/><br \/>Lucyline is very visionary, and she intends that in the near future, she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling it. She will also start selling dairy products such as yoghurt. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets.

Each loan she has received she has used for the home orders (of which she is receiving more.)<br \/><br \/>For Hortencia, the support of her daughters is fundamental, so the help her to mark prices and make notes in the notebook of the products and costs of what they ordered. The earnings have allowed her to integrate selling clothes for busy women through both jobs. <br \/><br \/>Hortencia has motivated more than 10 women who, similar to her, are single mothers. Today they sell cosmetics from catalogs to afford their home and provide a good quality of life to their family. <br \/><br \/>She is used to ordering more products, so her customers turn to her when they don't have eyeliner, eyeshadows, mascara, deodorant, cream, and perfumes. She says that she takes advantage of when the products are on sale, so in the following time when the prices are raised she sells at a lower price than the catalog. She will do this with the loan. <br \/><br \/>\"Thank you for supporting entrepreneurs like the members of our group, for giving us a new opportunity, and for showing interest in us and the well-being of our families\" are the words of appreciation from Hortencia. <br \/><br \/>*The photograph was taken at Alberto's house.

Calm, friendly but above all, it is distinguished for being a community of hardworking people who are always committed to creating respectful, responsible people.<br \/><br \/>The residents of this community demonstrate this every day that they get up early in the fields to cultivate the products that they later will serve as food. They are very proud to see how these, and other attitudes, contribute to the betterment of their families, friends and neighbors. <br \/><br \/>Don Navor is a man who is hardworking, friendly and always smiling. He is 53 years old and has been married to Concepcion for ten years. As of now, they do not have any children. Don Navor talked about before having a family; he worked in Mexico City building houses. Fortunately he met Concepcion with whom he decided to get married and this is why he didn\u2019t return to work. Don Navor left the city for the countryside and, for ten years, Don Navor has worked raising and fattening animals such as sheep, calves, chickens, hens, etc. He says that he got this idea because his parents also worked raising animals. \u201cSince I was little, my dad taught me to care for animals, because of this, I wanted to start my own business and also, it is a good business,\u201d commented Don Navor very happily.<br \/><br \/>He shares that he buys them very small, and, for some time, he cares for and fattens them in order to afterwards sell them. He buys them in his own community or in other communities and, when it is time to sell them, he tries to offer them to butcher shops or other people who come to his community. Fortunately, Don Navor does not have any problems with his animals. He remembers that when he stared he did not have pens, and when he started his business, his animals were very small and he bought them with his own savings.

She and her family live in a very quiet community. It is a Mazahua area and it's inhabitants are very friendly and are constantly trying to get ahead in some way.<br \/><br \/>Abe, as the people in her community know her, has a great entrepreneurial spirit. At 29, she has a stationary store that she has operated for seven years now. Abe says that she started her stationary shop because of the need to help her husband with the household expenses and the education of her children. At first she thought of opening a grocery store but there was a lot of competition. Then she thought of taking advantage of having a school quite close to her house and thought that a stationary store would be a good idea. \"I started out with only a few notebooks, paint, pens, ballpoint pens, erasers, the most indispensable items but little by little saw good profit and every time clients asked for more stationary products. She explains that with the small loans that the institution awarded her she was able to better her business little by little. <br \/><br \/>This time she is requesting a loan to buy stationary products like notebooks, loose leaf paper, erasers, paint, crayons, etc.  She is getting ready for the return to classes. She says that right now her profits are low as there are no classes. Abe is content and grateful for the loan because she says because of the loans her business has grown. Thanks to the loans she has been able to buy a photocopier, gifts, micro memory cards, USB sticks, children's stories, balls amongst others that have helped to increase her revenues. Every day Abe opens her shop very early to take care of her clients. She likes to have a lot of contact with her clients so she tries to offer them the best prices. <br \/><br \/>Abe's goal is to stock her stationary shop a bit more. she thinks that it is missing a number of things. She wants to continue with her business as it is a very good way to help with the family's expenses. And if on the other hand she were to close her shop she would have to go out and work and wouldn't be able to take care of her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":358.8,"image":{"id":1947457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy notebooks, loose leaf paper, pens, pencils, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Santa Cruz Mextepec, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-08-18T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-17T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1854},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1949.79},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2094.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2158.73},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2306.84},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2389.45},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2512.9},{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2691.85},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2781.82},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2940.98},{"due_date":"2016-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3077.5},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":3241.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.79},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.61},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.4},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.32},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.36},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.87},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.75},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.23},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.91},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.21},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":112.79,"local_amount":1854,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T19:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1854.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711701399},{"amount":118.61,"local_amount":1949.79,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:58:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1950.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204495},{"amount":127.4,"local_amount":2094.19,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2094.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291916}],"funded_date":"2015-08-25T17:48:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":933242,"name":"Judith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Judith is a married woman with six children.

The railroad created a demand for labor and brought the agricultural and livestock industries to their peak.Today, the area is known as \"La Novia del Sol\" because of the high temperatures that it experiences throughout the year. <br \/><br \/>The group's members and their businesses are:<br \/><br \/>Araceli - Sweets<br \/><br \/>Luis - Natural medicines <br \/><br \/>Maria - Footwear, clothing, and silver<br \/><br \/>Adriana - Sweets, pork cracklings, and shoes<br \/><br \/>Adela - Shoes and cosmetics <br \/><br \/>Braulia - Clothing <br \/><br \/>Estela - Shoes and bags<br \/><br \/>Don Luis is 61 years old and is the father of five children.  Presently, none of them depend financially on him.  For 10 years Don Guicho, as he is known, worked in a pharmacy where he learned the formulas of medicines.  He also studied a technical career as a pharmacist.<br \/><br \/>30 years ago he decided to become independent and started selling natural medicines as a street vendor from Monday to Friday.  He put a blanket on the ground where he placed the medicines.  With the passing of months, he built some wooden shelves where he displayed his merchandise the same way.  The profits he got allowed him to meet some of the household expenses.  He financially helped the mother of his children with the same expenses.<br \/><br \/>Today, he has moved from selling on the sidewalk to selling from a small shop where there are other merchants and he is the only one selling natural medicines.  Now he displays the medicines in racks, shelves, and a table.  \"The main motivation has always been my family, to provide the best for my children, and to see my work grow.\"  He says that the most difficult thing has been tolerating the insults from ignorant people who treat him like a charlatan.  Although it was annoying at first, today it does not bother him in the least because he is sure of what things are and he is happy to be earning a living in an honest way.<br \/><br \/>Don Luis has invested each of the loans in the purchase of eye drops, pills, soap, oil, and natural supplements, depending on which product he most needed.

In the afternoon, from Monday through Friday, \u00c1ngel goes to the shoreline of the dam to await the fisherman who sells him the fish and helps him to clean them (remove the entrails). After this, he groups them into small sets of a minimum of 3 to 7 fish depending on the size and weight. He fastens them with a string and an Izote plant leaf, for better control. In order to return home early, \u00c1ngel leaves home at 6 in the morning, at the latest, and begins selling by 8 in the morning. He offers good sized fish, friendliness and affordable prices, in addition to selling on credit to his most trusted customers. <br \/><br \/>He will use the loan he has received to buy as much fish as with the previous loans, thus securing his business\u2019s growth.

In the Linda Vista district, a group was formed 5 years ago, and its members decided to name it as the place where they live, thus \"Linda Vista\" (Beautiful view). Currently, the group has 10 members. They are:  Susana, Irma, Rosalina, Magdalena - Grocery Store Items, Soledad \u2013Tamales, Lina \u2013 Footwear by catalog, Alejandra - Daycare Center, Angelina \u2013 Clothing,  Guillermina \u2013 Botanas (Seeds), \u00c1ngeles \u2013 Hot Dogs. Susana is 37 years old. God gave her the joy of a 9 year old daughter and a 5 month old boy. She lives in domestic partnership with Domingo for 8 years already. Susi, as she is called here, had her mother's grocery store transferred to her, which has allowed her to pay for her daughter's expenses, who was 6 years old at the time. The earned income has allowed her to continue with the store, because she has invested it to buy rice, beans, sugar, soup, oil, eggs, tuna fish, sardines, mayonnaise, canned chiles, beverages, cookies and chips, just to mention some of the products she buys in big quantity when she gets the loan. Her two children are her main motivation to continue and give the best of her day by day. To offer them a better future and assets is her most precious wish. This time, the loan will be useful to buy: sugar, coffee, oil, milk, detergent, toilet paper and beverages. Besides using the earnings for the store and for her children's expenses, they will be helpful to change the stove, refrigerator and two fans. \"I like to work, to assist each and every one of my customers.

Ten years ago, with the help of her husband, and because she loved plants, she started a small nursery on the patio of her house where she cultivated a variety of species of plants.  When each of them bloomed, the patio was washed with color, and she would sell the plants to the visitors that would come to her from the community to buy plants.  She mentions that the best sellers are: Dahlias, Corona de Cristo, Ixoras, palms, and Beaucarnea plants.  On her own initiative she has made her own compost from the trees with the help of her daughters.  Her son helps her care for the plants when he can.\r\n\r\nChabe cares for her plants as if they were her children. \"I am content with my plants and my family, and feeling useful and making money motivate me,\" she says.  With her previous loan, she bought organic fertilizer, plastic bags, and a variety of plants to fulfill her commitment to sell plants in the town fair. She will use this loan to buy plastic bags, plants, fertilizer, and boxes for planting and transplanting.  \"Not everyone has the hands to plant plants and have them 'stick',\" are the words of Chabe, who propagates plants by layering in order to produce more plants and offer a good selection to her customers.  \r\n\r\nNote:  the photograph was taken in the patio where Chabe keeps her plants.

She combines the store with vegetable vending and a mini-canteen. She cooks viands and snacks for her mini-canteen. Usually her customers take out the food and sometimes they just eat in front of her store while standing. You may notice that she lacks facilities such as tables and chairs, and the place has a small roof. She wants it renovated to make it conducive for eating so it can attract more customers. She will also buy grocery items as added supplies for her variety store plus additional vegetables. To meet this purpose, she applied for a PHP 25,000 loan. Her increased income will help meet her daily needs and her savings. She's a widow with children who are no longer dependent on her. They are starting their own families. That's why Carmen doesn't want to depend on them. As much as possible, she still intends to earn money by herself.

growing, and harvesting sugar and corn and cutting mango.  The barking of dogs, the clucking of the chickens, and the song of the roosters are music to the community.<br \/><br \/>A group formed in the community, Vicente Guerrero, which is the name of the main street.  The members of the group and their jobs are Rosal\u00eda, Mar\u00eda A., and Daniela, soft drinks; Luciana, groceries; In\u00e9s, cosmetics; Yolanda and Mariel, clothing; Josefina, chicken; Lidia, Tupperware and bedclothes; Teodora, food and soft drinks; Jessica, food; Mar\u00eda, costume jewelry; and Yesenia, cosmetics and shoes.<br \/><br \/>Luciana, 60, was widowed six years ago.  She has seven children and thirteen grandchildren who fill her home with happiness on the weekend and during vacations.  Luc\u00ed, as she is known, started selling chicken seven years ago with her first loan from VisionFund Mexico (previously Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad).  Two years after receiving her first loan she started a new job with her profits and another loan.<br \/><br \/>For five years Luc\u00ed has awakened at 5 in the morning to kill and season the chickens.  She's the only one who sells chicken, so she sells an average of 15-20 per week.  She puts them on a shelf with the scale and the pan where she displays her merchandise.  To be able to set up her little store, she made a place in what was the living room of her house where now she puts the rice, sugar, beans, soup, oil, tuna, mayonnaise, flour, corn flour, eggs, matches, detergent, and toilet paper.<br \/><br \/>\"I'm happy with my work that keeps me in assets.\"  The loans have been useful to her for this.

On the island of San Miguel Soyaltepec, there is a small Mazateca community who conserves its traditions and customs, keeping the site in accordance to their traditional lifestyle. It makes the place a tourist destination on the lagoon called (Laguna de Las Mil Islas) The Thousand Islands, which is the Miguel Aleman dam. <br \/><br \/>The group is called \"Selecci\u00f3n (Selection)\" because they form part of a group selected by the same members according to their references. The group is currently formed by: Mar\u00eda (beauty shop), Efigenia (water purification), Natalia (fruits and fruit juices), Julia, Rosal\u00eda, M\u00f3nica (grocery store), Domitila (food), Obdulia (tailoring), Mar\u00eda Isabel (taco shop), Ofelia (chicken), Adriana (clothing), and Dulce (taco shop). <br \/><br \/>Mar\u00eda is 66 years old. In town, everyone knows her as Mari. She has dedicated 34 years of her life to being a stylist in a small building located in the market, where she gives her customers appointments as part of the friendly service, compliance with her requirements, and the prices that she offers. \"I learned to cut hair from watching my mother who cut our hair.\"<br \/><br \/>Upon reaching her older age, she began to take beauty courses offered by DIF and this was how she learned the main skills. She says that as time has passed, the practice allows her to be constantly updated. When she first started, she cut hair in her house for 6 years while she saved up the money to set up shop in the building where she now is. <br \/><br \/>For Mari, her beauty shop is the best thing because with the earnings, she has been able to make sure her children keep studying, she is paying the household expenses, she has made adjustments to the building, and she teaches two grandchildren who live with her. <br \/><br \/>The first loan that she received was used for 2 razors, 1 hairdryer, dye, combs, cloaks and a wooden bench. She was looking to offer quality and comfort to her customers, which has worked well for her because she continues to work.

Since childhood Clau (as her neighbors know her) was taught by her parents to work and invest her time in something productive. When she was young she helped her mother deliver tamales and stuffed peppers every weekend. Upon reaching adulthood she started to work in a beauty shop to be able to support her parents with the expenses of the home. After turning 40, she put a small beauty shop in her house which is made up of a large mirror, a chair, brushes, a dryer, a small shaving machine, scissors, barrettes, capes and a lot of charisma. They are the perfect allies to offer her clients a quality service. The earnings allowed her to start selling a well-known brand of cosmetics, obtaining 50% of the earnings. She learned to do facials as a demonstration of the cosmetics. <br \/><br \/>She invested the previous loan in the purchase of cosmetics (creams, blush, eyeliners, concealer, face masks, and lotions) that her clients had asked her for. On this occasion, motivated by closures, she will invest in the purchase of bleach, peroxide, dye, hair ties, barrettes, tubes, spray, gel, styling cream, and hair treatments. <br \/><br \/>\"I like what I do and I earn money by doing it; perseverance allows me to reach my objectives, like dreaming with my eyes open\" are Clau's words.<br \/><br \/>The members of the group express thanks to Visi\u00f3nFund M\u00e9xico and KIVA for providing them a new loan. <br \/><br \/>*The photograph was taken in Clau's house in the space where she cuts, styles, and dyes hair, and applies makeup.

Thanks to Babban Gona's support, Ayuba now has the opportunity to increase his yields and income and use his additional earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1957550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase improved farm inputs that will increase the farmer\u2019s yields.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-08-19T01:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-18T01:30:04Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ayuba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":42647.61,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":42647.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-08-19T16:17:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":933484,"name":"Irvin Francisco","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irvin is a 24-year-old man who recently finished his career at the local state university. <br \/><br \/>Irvin just obtained his degree in social services, but he wants to get a masters degree at a private college.

She runs a tailoring and clothing-selling business.\r\n\r\nShe is optimistic, cheerful, and a good mother\u2014a hard worker who has a good attitude and is responsible and committed to her work.\r\n\r\nHer business is located in the Plan 3000 suburb, in the southern part of the city, within the peri-urban area. This region has a subtropical climate, with temperatures around 21-35 degrees Celsius (69.8-95 degrees Fahrenheit). The area has seen a significant population growth in the last few years mainly because of the arrival of migrants from the interior. \r\n\r\nAyda is short, with a slim build. She has a tanned complexion, brownish-grey eyes, and long black hair\u2014which she ties up. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks at home, and she speaks Spanish for general knowledge and business purposes. (In the photo, she is the one sitting on the right, wearing a white blouse with horizontal stripes.) \r\n\r\nShe shares her life with her partner, who works as a cab driver, and her son, who is finishing school. They live in their own wooden house, which has a corrugated iron roof and brick flooring. The house is equipped with basic utilities (water, electricity, and a sewer system).\r\n\r\nThe need to improve her business drove her to lead a communal bank in order to ask for a loan to improve the members' businesses. These businesses include selling fried chicken, beverages, second-hand clothing, vegetables, cheese, ceramic crafts, and sheets.   \r\n\r\nAyda's business is making and selling clothing. She buys different lengths of fabric to make women's and men's clothing to sell. She works from her home the whole week. \"I buy an assortment of fabrics in all colours and make simple garments such as blouses and tops. I sell the garments at my business and also on the streets,\" she says. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that she sells her creations. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy lengths of fabric in different colours. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to expand her sewing workshop in her home. She wants to buy lengths of fabric and an industrial sewing machine. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan cycle with the institution in the six years that she has been running this business.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Ayda is requesting a loan to buy lengths of fabric in different colours so that she can recover her lost customers.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1603.93,"image":{"id":1943096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy lengths of fabric in different colours so that she can recover her lost customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-08-19T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-18T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":4725,"lender_count":127,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ayda Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katerine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Escarly Asunt","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Clarithze","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Casta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Pascuala ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicia             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Solange               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-13T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":32500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-13T04:00:00Z","amount":3463.8},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":3716.64},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T04:00:00Z","amount":3851.91},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T04:00:00Z","amount":3992.13},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T04:00:00Z","amount":4137.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-31T04:00:00Z","amount":4288.04},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T04:00:00Z","amount":4444.13},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T04:00:00Z","amount":4605.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":503.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":540.34},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":560.01},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":580.39},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":601.52},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":623.42},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":646.11},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":669.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1043.92,"local_amount":7180.44,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":7192.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296945},{"amount":560.01,"local_amount":3851.91,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3858.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752077079}],"funded_date":"2015-09-17T15:25:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Flores","image":null}},{"id":933574,"name":"Ilene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ilene is married with three children and operates a motorcycle transportation business.

Many of the women work in traditional weaving. <br \/><br \/>The women in the group range in age from 23 to 41. Four of them are illiterate and the most education any one of them has is sixth grade. In the group there are seven who sell traditional clothing, one who has a small store and also makes and sells ice cream, and one who sells coconuts and fried potatoes. These are hardworking women and they became interested in working with Namaste because they felt they needed to know a lot more about managing a business. Namaste will provide them with basic financial training, a business adviser to help them develop and follow a business plan, and a small loan. They are very hopeful that these tools will make a difference in their business and their profits.<br \/><br \/>Do\u00f1a Francisca is 35 years old, married with three children.

She herself has only a fourth grade education.  Her husband works as a day laborer. Francisca has worked selling traditional clothing since she was very young. With the income from her business she helps support her family. She will invest her loan money in increasing her stock of clothing. She specifically wants to buy belts, shawls and a larger variety of blouses. Her dream is to make enough money to buy a gas stove, to avoid having smoke in the house from the wood stove she uses now. She knows the smoke affects the health of her family.<br \/><br \/>She currently has a monthly net profit of 3765 Guatemalan Quetzales, working 200 hours a month.

difficult to make a decent profit, a situation which worsens in the hot season (now ongoing), which typically sees very low sales.<br \/>When October rolls around, however, Alejandra needs to be ready to increase her production, since her products are very much in demand during the winter.<br \/>Alejandra is a loyal member of VFM\u00e9xico, and the financial support the latter extends helps her

The above picture presents Florah, who is a mother of two and has been practicing agriculture for the last 5 years. Because of the immense knowledge she has about farming, she commands a lot of respect among other farmers and she is viewed as a mentor in her village. She lives together with her children in the Kitale area of Kenya, which is known for maize plantations for export and for local consumption. Her primary income sources are eggs, milk, and some personal business she engages in to supplement her meagre income. Generating an income through selling harvest is the part of farming she enjoys most. Availability of labour is a major challenge for Florah. She also keeps a dairy cow. <br \/><br \/>Before joining Juhudi Kilimo, Florah could not access loans from banks since they considered her a high risk client. She mobilized marginalized farmers and created the group Musemwa self-help group. Through the group, she joined Juhudi Kilimo and learnt about loan management and agribusiness. She also got to learn about Kiva. <br \/><br \/>Florah is seeking a loan for constructing a cow shed and to purchase farm implements. With your loan, Florah will introduce zero grazing (an environmentally sound method of cattle care) and purchase more effective modern tools that will make her farm activities much easier. This will boost her income and enable her to pay school fees for her children. Florah waits for your kindness.<br \/>Support this great smallholder farmer who is not deterred by difficulty so that she can achieve a good future for her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":94.2,"image":{"id":1957407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farm implements.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-19T13:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-18T13:20:08Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2016-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.35},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.73},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.62},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.13},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.68},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.28},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.92},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.62},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.36},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.6,"local_amount":5360.22,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:21Z","rounded_local_amount":5518.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024232},{"amount":40.6,"local_amount":4059.84,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4180.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112269}],"funded_date":"2015-09-14T20:33:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":933417,"name":"Beatrace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrace, a fifty-two-year-old hard working, married woman, living in Kamwenge, Uganda, used her previous loan to buy more farm inputs for her coffee plantation.
