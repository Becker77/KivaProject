The women who live in the town wear some of the most beautiful and colorful traditional outfits in Guatemala. The customs and governments of Chichicastenango are based on a mixture of indigenous and Catholic traditions. The beautiful church in the center of town is a perfect example of this mixture.  Mayan ceremonies and processions are often seen on the steps and around the exterior of the church while religious ceremonies occur inside.<br \/><br \/>Friendship Bridge serves over 22,000 impoverished women in the country who greatly benefit from the \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program of the organization that combines education and small loans. In Chichicastenango, the Trust Bank \u201cCumez\u201d is about to begin its second loan cycle with Friendship Bridge. The ladies have seen how much they have progressed, both economically and personally, in their first loan cycle. They are excited to be requesting a second loan that they hope will be funded by Kiva lenders.<br \/><br \/>The women in \u201cCumez\u201d have an average of 6 children and have varying degrees of a primary school education. Sebastiana is 53 years old and a member of the group. She has six children and works hard to meet their needs. She has two businesses including animal husbandry and the embroidering of traditional colorful woven blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d (pronounced wee-pee-les). She creates them in various styles and designs. Sebastiana also sells chickens and pigs that she raises. She is requesting a loan to purchase 15 pounds of thread, 25 boxes of high quality embroidery cotton in various colors and other supplies. Her goal is to attract more clients and increase her earnings.\t<br \/><br \/>The ladies in the \u201cCumez\u201d Trust Bank want to thank Kiva lenders for believing in them and their goals. They are poised to step into a more prosperous future benefitting themselves, their families and their community in Chichicastenango, Guatemala. Thank you, Kiva lenders!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":920,"image":{"id":1957585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase good quality thread and other necessary supplies for her textiles business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.666667 -90.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2015-08-19T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-18T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":4600,"lender_count":138,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sebastiana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melida Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Marta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sebastiana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Angela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santos Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herlinda Tomasa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tomasa Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":4600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-14T06:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T06:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T06:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T06:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T06:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T06:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T06:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T06:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T06:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T06:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":460},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":460},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":460},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":460},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":460},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":460},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":460},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":460},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":460},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":460}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":460,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3516.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730991595},{"amount":460,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3516.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752079864}],"funded_date":"2015-08-19T20:33:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":931473,"name":"Carlos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El socio Carlos se dedica al negocio de venta de choclos, el socio es una persona trabajadora que por medio de este negocio el socio saca adelante a su familia,el sue\u00f1o del socio es ampliar el negocio de venta de choclos.El socio solicita el cr\u00e9dito para comprar choclos al por mayor.\n\nEl socio est\u00e1 feliz por el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con los pagos de su cuota.","en":"Carlos sells sweet corn.

The terrain is mountainous frequently having low hanging clouds swirling about that makes it seem to the people that they live next to the sky.  Santa Cruz del Quiche is the capital of the State and this is where seven inspired and industrious women formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cLos Celajes\u201d.  Recently, they successfully completed repaying their first loan financed by the investors of Kiva.  They are very pleased with their success and now they are requesting a second loan.<br \/><br \/>The always smiling twenty-nine year old Hilda graduated as an executive secretary.  She sells underwear and also makes and sells sausages (chorizos, longanizas, pickled beef & chicken). Hilda\u2019s short term goal is to save money so that she can open a market where she can display her products.  She is asking Kiva lenders for another loan so that she can buy a variety of clothing to resell.  She also wants to buy the raw products to make her sausages.  All of these efforts go toward her ultimate goal of being a strong source of income that will provide a good education for her two children, as well as provide opportunities for a good healthy life. <br \/><br \/>The ladies of \u201cLos Celajes\u201d meet once each month to make payments on their loans and to participate in educational training sessions led by a Friendship Bridge Facilitator. The organization calls the effective combination of loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d. Some of the subjects covered include violence against women and women\u2019s rights, self-esteem and empowerment as well as setting goals. Other topics include nutrition, health and hygiene and the use of medicinal plants. The women learn to manage their loans most effectively with information about planning, budgeting, pricing, marketing, customer service and accounting.<br \/>All the women of \u201cLos Celajes\u201d are proud to be a part of an important organization like Friendship Bridge.  This is especially the case of Gulelia who says \u201cThanks to the loans from Friendship Bridge, I have been able to buy land and build a house.  Before I had to rent.  I was able to do this because I learned so much from the monthly classes where I was taught about gender equity, business management and investment, as well as the importance of having savings.  Thank you again Kiva lenders for helping to make my life brighter!!\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":840,"image":{"id":1957595,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy the raw products to make her sausages.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santa Cruz del Quiche, El Quiche","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2015-08-19T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-18T13:40:02Z","loan_amount":4200,"lender_count":128,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gudelia Bettzaida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayra Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda Aurora Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina Del Socorro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Catarina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-12T06:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":32000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":4200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-17T06:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T06:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T06:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T06:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T06:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T06:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T06:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2016-04-21T06:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2016-05-19T06:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2016-06-16T06:00:00Z","amount":3200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":420},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":420}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":420,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:18:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3210.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730991596},{"amount":420,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:16:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3210.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752079865}],"funded_date":"2015-09-17T14:26:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":933689,"name":"Anecita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anecita is already 73 years old.

She has worked in agriculture raising poultry for more than 10 years.  Nga lives in Quang Xuong district, a  rural town in Thanh Hoa province.<br \/>Her family is a low-income household in village, moreover the income from this job is unstable because when some diseases on poultry happen, she has nothing to sell and she will be in trouble with finance.<br \/><br \/>The main hardship that Nga faces is lack of capital.

She also hopes to help her less fortunate relatives and friends.

Basically, sari-sari stores can be found in every town and city. Products here are cheap, since for only P1.00 you can buy a piece of candy or sweet, compared to supermarkets where most products are sold wholesale. You  can even buy a sachet of shampoo, powdered drink or other small item. They earn approximately Php 20,000 each month from the variety store.\r\n\r\nManaging more than one business is enjoyable for Pia since she and her husband work together to make a living.

She decided to apply for a loan of Php 18,000 to add grocery items to her variety store and upgrade\/repair each of her computers. She also wants to thank lenders for helping entrepreneurs like her. She is hopeful that you will consider her story. \r\n\r\nPia believes that if you want success to come, you need God to be your greatest foundation. She is consistent in attending a weekly fellowship group for CCT partners that consists of 15 to 30 members where she gains spiritual strength from members' life changing testimonies, shares her own experience of God\u2019s love, pays micro finance loans and hears God\u2019s word that is conveyed to them every week."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":346.68,"image":{"id":1957995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to upgrade and repair the computers and to add grocery items for her variety store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Muntinlupa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-08-19T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-18T15:10:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":133.35,"local_amount":6000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":6169,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434428},{"amount":106.68,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:36:19Z","rounded_local_amount":4935.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955377},{"amount":106.65,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:13:41Z","rounded_local_amount":4935.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045221}],"funded_date":"2015-08-19T17:11:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Margaret Rosen","image":null}},{"id":933730,"name":"Elna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of five children, Elna works hard to support her family.\n\nShe has a rice retailing business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from buy and sell charcoal.

Jelly sees the opportunity in that need. \n\nWith this in mind, Jelly decided to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan as additional capital for her direct sale business. She believes that one of the secrets to increasing the profit of a business is to add to the quantity of products, that is why she asks for your help to increase her income.\n\nBeing a longtime member of the CCT, Jelly has been consistently attending the CCT fellowship group.

This is the fourth loan for Tae with Kiva\u2019s partner, VisionFund. She completely paid back the past loans. Now she is applying for another loan to buy fertilizers and pesticide for her farmland and will also use some of it to spend on plowing the fields. She hopes this loan will enable her to extend her agribusiness and also grow her crops healthily so she can make more income to improve her living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":1952460,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizers and pesticide for her farmland and to plow the fields.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Siem Reap Province, Srey Snom district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2015-08-19T17:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-18T17:20:10Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tae  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":625000},{"due_date":"2017-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":625000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.25},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:13:59Z","rounded_local_amount":516875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752282297}],"funded_date":"2015-08-25T17:02:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":933772,"name":"Jlg-004-Kurichi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Devagi is a mother of four children.

She studied up to grade 2 and due to the economic situation of her family studied no more. She is single and has three children, all of them adults with two of them married. So she and her daughter live alone in her house. <br \/><br \/>Amargot works selling snacks like tamales and atole (a corn based drink). She decided to sell these snacks when her children were small. Doing this she raised them and could provide them with what was necessary. Her business worked for her and it seemed like a good idea to keep it going. For this reason she has many clients today who request orders so she doesn't have to go out and sell from house to house. These days the customers come to her house. <br \/><br \/>But besides her small business she also works in small scale farming. Thanks to the profits her business brings in she can plant corn and beans. When the harvests are good she sells her grains to have another income and have what she needs for her and her daughter. <br \/><br \/>Amargot needs the loan to buy a griddle to make pupusas and tortillas, and to buy corn flour, vegetables and condiments to make the foods she sells. This will allow her to make her work easier and make food quicker. This way she can increase her food production and improve her profits.<br \/><br \/>Amargot dreams of improving her business and increasing her sales.

He is a role model, a mentor, and an inspiration to many young farmers in his village because of his resilience despite personal challenges and his passion to support his family as a primary source of income. The living conditions in the Kitale area are very tough and one needs to have tough skin in order to survive. Emmanuel has always shown the resilience to beat all odds. <br \/><br \/>Because of the hardcore poverty in his village, Emmanuel started practicing mixed farming and has been doing it for the past 5 years. Emmanuel's sources of income are from producing vegetables, maize, and eggs. These products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, which is a problem for Emmanuel. The Kitale area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market. <br \/><br \/>Emmanuel is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. Emmanuel is very determined to succeed, and because he is very disciplined with finances, he plans to accumulate profits to provide a secure future for himself and for his parents. Emmanuel's dream is to provide a secure future for his family.

The money was used to buy additional stock like bottled drinks, grocery items, school supplies and other products.

She is aware that competitors in this line of business are rampant. That\u2019s why she is still contemplating ways on how to attract buyers\/consumers. Turning her sari-sari store into a grocery store is one of her goals. Since it is her bread and butter, Evelyn exerts her effort and hard work for the business since this really helped her sustain her family\u2019s needs and support her children\u2019s education. Added capital will help her business flourish. <br \/><br \/>That\u2019s why Evelyn decided to apply for another P40,000 this year to buy additional stock such as laundry products, drinks, toiletries, canned goods, school supplies and other items. <br \/><br \/>Despite being busy managing the business, Evelyn is still consistent in attending CCT group fellowship that consist of 10-15 individuals. This is where she can gain strength spiritually, where she hears testimonies from other CCT partners and is able to hear God\u2019s word, study the Word of God, build social relationships with other partners, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":473.98,"image":{"id":1953517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional stock such as laundry products, drinks, toiletries, canned goods, school supplies and other items for her variety store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-08-19T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-18T18:00:03Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.45},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.45},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.45},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":328.14,"local_amount":15000.03,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":15184.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955327},{"amount":145.84,"local_amount":6666.68,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":6748.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045171}],"funded_date":"2015-09-10T12:47:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":933838,"name":"Dorothy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dorothy is a married woman with 2 children.

The one thing she would like to change, however, is the fact that they lack a toilet at home.<br \/><br \/>With no access to a toilet, her family members have to walk long distances to answer nature's call in private: in dense bushes or isolated fields. The women and girls, seeking privacy, often resort to waking up before sunrise to relieve themselves. Due to this lack of sanitation facilities, they are at risk of infection and fall ill often, spending a significant portion of their savings on medical expenses each month. <br \/><br \/>So, taking advantage of the awareness initiatives, Logeshwari is seeking a loan to build a toilet at home. The other women in the group are in a similar situation and are also seeking loans to build toilets at home. Your loan will help these 4 hardworking rural Indian families to access basic sanitation, and consequently, safety, improved health, medical savings, and improved productivity."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":97.23,"image":{"id":1957477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to construct toilets and improve sanitation facilities in their homes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Kulithalai","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":428,"posted_date":"2015-08-19T18:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-18T18:00:06Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Logeshwari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Muthulakshmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dhanalakshmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chitra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":56000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3111.11},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3111.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3111.11},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3111.11},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3111.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3111.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3111.11},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3111.11},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3111.11},{"due_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3111.11},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3111.11},{"due_date":"2016-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3111.11},{"due_date":"2016-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3111.11},{"due_date":"2016-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3111.11},{"due_date":"2016-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3111.11},{"due_date":"2016-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3111.11},{"due_date":"2017-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3111.11},{"due_date":"2017-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3111.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.62},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.62,"local_amount":3111.11,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3165.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731047096},{"amount":48.61,"local_amount":3111.11,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":3165.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752135848}],"funded_date":"2015-09-02T02:52:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":931048,"name":"Jlg-015-Ayyarmalai Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"34-year-old Vijaya from Kulithalai, in rural Tamil Nadu has no toilet at home or in the immediate vicinity.

Trias, Cavite, Philippines. She is happily married to Isidro, a chief cook. To help her husband make a living and save up for their old age, Florencia thought of putting up a \"Smart Padala\" Center.<br \/><br \/>A \"Smart Padala\" business is like a small remittance center where people can send and receive cash as long as they are registered with Smart Money. Filipinos who work in industrial zones or manufacturing companies regularly send money to their families and relatives who live in the provinces. <br \/><br \/>To help her operate her business, Florencia is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan to purchase a new mobile phone and pay for money credits from banks to use in her funds transfer business. She is happy with the initial outcome of her money remittance business. Filipinos prefer to go to a Smart Padala Center rather than the other older Money Remittance Center for its cheaper fees. <br \/><br \/>Florencia believes that her fund transfer business is going to be more successful in the coming years as more manufacturing companies are being built in their area.

It will also mean they no longer need to walk long distances, especially when they are sick. So, together, the group is seeking a loan of INR 42,000 to build a toilet in their respective homes. Your loan will help these three hardworking rural Indian families to access basic sanitation, and consequently, safety, improved health, medical savings, and improved productivity."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":72.23,"image":{"id":1958193,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to fund the installation of a toilet in her home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Kulithalai","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":428,"posted_date":"2015-08-19T19:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-18T19:10:16Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rojamani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jothilakshmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kavitha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":42000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2017-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2017-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.12,"local_amount":2333.33,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:16:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2359.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731047102},{"amount":36.11,"local_amount":2333.33,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2359.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752135856}],"funded_date":"2015-09-11T09:42:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":933853,"name":"Believe In Ourselves - N1Ttr\u00e01Qtrung Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs T\u00e2m is 33 years old and she is marrie  She has had a retail business selling\u00a0dry food and general things for 8 years.

She works hard to support her family with a limited income of INR 8500, and saves diligently. However, the current income is not adequate for her family to access basic necessities like a toilet in their home. They have to trek long distances at dawn to use the fields to relieve themselves. These unsanitary practices make them vulnerable to infections, and the lack of privacy exposes them to molestation or worse. Sometimes, the monthly salary is spent on health problems caused by lack of toilets; hence leaving little for other expenses. <br \/><br \/>Taking advantage of the awareness initiatives, the group members now seek a loan of INR 42,000 to build toilets in their homes. Your loan will provide these three families the privacy of using their own toilet, which will be a big step towards a better standard of living for them. Higher standards of hygiene will also lead to reduced medical expenses, and hence, more savings in the long run."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":72.23,"image":{"id":1958197,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to construct a toilet and improve sanitation facilities at her home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Kulithalai","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":428,"posted_date":"2015-08-19T19:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-18T19:20:09Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vasavi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malarmani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Umamaheshwari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":42000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2017-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2017-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.12,"local_amount":2333.33,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:16:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2359.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731047103},{"amount":36.11,"local_amount":2333.33,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2359.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752135857}],"funded_date":"2015-09-11T08:18:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":933858,"name":"Benta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benta is a married woman and describes herself to be hopeful.

He also married a beautiful and loving wife and they have 3 children. <br \/><br \/>Paul practices farming on a 4-acre farm that is owned by the family in the village of Kaptoror. On the farm, he grows vegetables, beans and maize. He also keeps more than two highly productive dairy cows for milk production. The 34-year-old farmer sells his produce in bulk to the nearby market. His key clients are his neighbours and local people. He is a member of Sangat self-help Group, a group formed to help members, who are smallholder farmers, to save and use the savings to access loans from financial institutions. <br \/><br \/>Paul is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to build a greenhouse and also to start milk vending business. He needs greenhouse technology to continuously improve the productivity, profitability and sustainability of his major farming systems. A greenhouse will provide a favorable environment for his plants. It will also protect the plants from adverse climatic conditions such as wind, cold, precipitation, excessive radiation, extreme temperature, insects and diseases. <br \/><br \/>With your lending, Paul will have a year-round production of crops and off-season production of vegetable and fruits. He will also save on the use of natural resources such as water. Water requirement of crops is very limited and easy to control with this technology. Through the loan he will be able to sell milk to his neighbours and also to the nearby market hence making more money. Paul has a great credit history he took a KES 65,000 loan and successfully serviced it. This will be his second loan with Juhudi Kilimo. After successfully clearing the previous loans, he stated that this loan will change his life. Profits from this investment will be be plowed back into the business to fuel further growth. There still remains so much space on his land for future growth. If there ever was an opportunity to invest a $25 loan in someone's future, it is here!

Edith has a store where she sells all that is needed for cooking, such as sugar, rice and oil. She has had the store for ten years, and it was the need to have an income source which motivated her to open it, and it was successful.

Although she has only farmed for the past ten years, she is working hard and learning good farming practices. Through the profits she makes from keeping cows and goats, she has been able to take care of her family and provide the basic needs for her parents. Philis lives near Matisi in the Kitale area of Kenya, an area with good weather patterns and favorable weather conditions that support farming. <br \/><br \/>Maize is a very common crop in Kenya and is a staple food for many who regularly eat \u201cugali,\u201c or hard porridge cooked from maize. One can usually buy sifted maize flour in the market, but its cost is higher because of the processing. Flour can be less expensive, however, if it is milled directly using a posho mill. The Matisi area has only one diesel posho mill that serves a great number of people. The main problem here is that the posho mill keeps breaking down so farmers cannot grind their maize. <br \/><br \/>Philis intends to change this by buying another posho mill to serve the area. She will buy an electric, rather than diesel, posho mill, as they are more reliable. To accomplish this, Philis is applying for a 60,000 KES loan through Juhudi Kilimo to buy a mill. Profits derived from the mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan. In the next two years, Philis sees herself established and running more than one posho mill.

She then transports them to a grinding mill where they are refined into fine PVC substances which she then sell to a local shoe manufacturing company.<br \/><br \/>Ongai together with her other group members joined Thrive in June 2015 and received business advice which she said were very helpful to her and is very appreciative for these trainings. They have applied for a combined loan of $US 1,450 and she wants to use her portion of the loan amount to transport many tonnes of PVC material from dumpsites to the grinding mill and also to pay for the refinery charges. Ongai said she has a long term plan of buying her own grinding mill and start to refine PVC on her own selling to shoe manufacturing companies."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":483.34,"image":{"id":1958287,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wholesale","sector":"Wholesale","themes":null,"use":"to transport PVC waste in bulk for recycling.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-08-19T21:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-18T21:00:07Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patience","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ongai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":241.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":241.67,"local_amount":241.67,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:30:06Z","rounded_local_amount":241.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731183094},{"amount":241.67,"local_amount":241.67,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:52:02Z","rounded_local_amount":241.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752271238}],"funded_date":"2015-08-20T10:49:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":932906,"name":"Gulnara","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0413\u0443\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0430, 51 \u0433\u043e\u0434, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0433\u043e\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438 3 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 -

Her garments are made to order for each customer, according to his or her specifications, while maintaining innovative designs and excellent quality. Marlene is applying for her first Kiva loan through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. She will invest the funds in improving her shop in order to expand it, purchasing new display cases and raw materials. This investment is very important, since she will be able to buy her materials wholesale at a lower cost, and her profits will be more respectable. In this way, she will get closer to her goal of having her own boutique in her home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":54.22,"image":{"id":1954275,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to invest in buying new display cases and raw materials to improve and expand her workshop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-08-19T21:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-18T21:30:04Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":66555},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":86552},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":89148},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":91823},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":94577},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":97415},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":100337},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":103347},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":106448},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":109641},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":112930},{"due_date":"2016-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":141227}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.57},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.65},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.57},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.52},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.54},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.6},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.7},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.83},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":23.57,"local_amount":66555,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":69373.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730994723},{"amount":30.65,"local_amount":86552,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":90216.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752082672}],"funded_date":"2015-08-28T15:37:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":933952,"name":"Asia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asia is 55 years old woman, residing in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, with her husband and 3 children.

Although her husband is an OFW, she thought of putting up a small general store not only to keep herself busy but also to earn extra income to adequately meet their daily household needs and more importantly to send her children to private schools. school. \n\nMay has been operating her store for eight years already. Her earnings has greatly helped cover their daily sustenance. She sells dry, and packaged commodities directly to consumers. All products are essential food items. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store means a lot to her since it has been their main source of income when her husband was not an OFW yet.\n\nTo help her expand her business, she is requesting a Php 19000 loan which she will use to buy additional sacks of rice and other grocery items such as can goods, instant noodles, biscuits, soda, toiletries, etc. Although there are times she has difficulty collecting her receivable from some of her customers she still maintains a positive and understanding attitude towards them. \n\nMay dreams of having a big grocery store someday and of course to see both her children finish college and become successful professionals.

This group of four, led by Vani, living in Kulithalai in the state of Tamil Nadu understands the importance of having a toilet at home. Vani is 31 years old and has a family size of two. They do not have the means to build a toilet. With no access to a toilet, her family has to walk long distances to answer nature's call in private: in dense bushes or isolated fields. The women and girls, seeking privacy, often resort to waking up before sunrise to relieve themselves. They are subsequently at risk of infection, molestation, and even insect or animal bites. <br \/><br \/>Taking matters into their own hands, Vani and her group want to build toilets for themselves in their own homes.

Last year, she experienced a great joy in life: she became a mother for the fourth time. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kitale, which is in the Rift valley region of Kenya. Everline is happily married and is blessed with a lovely family. For the past 10 years, she has been involved in maintaining dairy cows and growing maize and vegetables. Everline has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with the challenge of delivering the produce in a timely manner to the market. This challenge has not made her give up, and she states, \u201cI have to do something for my family.\u201c Everline joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a micro finance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She requests a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Everline is from a remote village that has poor roads, and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables, and tomatoes) that require timely delivery to the market. This loan will help Everline to achieve her dream and reach her goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Everline feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva that help women to gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are significant because Everline will never suffer losses due to delay in delivering produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. Her income will increase. Everline is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike and help with farm work. Everline will use the loan to improve her living conditions and assure her children of a secure future. With your contribution this farmer will be able to achieve her dreams."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":117.14,"image":{"id":1958340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike to transport her farm products to market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-19T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-18T22:00:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Everline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5661.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5827.3},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":5997.6},{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":6172.88},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":6353.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":6538.96},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":6730.06},{"due_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":6926.74},{"due_date":"2016-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7129.18},{"due_date":"2016-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7337.53},{"due_date":"2016-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7551.97},{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":7772.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.62},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.98},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.73},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.53},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.39},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.3},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.27},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.29},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.37},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.52},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.4,"local_amount":5739.93,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:22Z","rounded_local_amount":5892.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024239},{"amount":59.74,"local_amount":5974.44,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":6132.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112273}],"funded_date":"2015-09-17T11:44:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Steven Soltesz","image":null}},{"id":931480,"name":"Heidy Yamileth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Heidi, de 20 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta sexto grado, est\u00e1 casada y su esposo al igual que ella se dedica al comercio de pan, tienen un hijo de tres a\u00f1os de edad.\n\nHeidi, tiene una venta de pan y esta actividad la realizan desde hace cinco a\u00f1os y ellos trabajan todos los d\u00edas desde muy temprano y salen a repartir el pan en una motocicleta.\n\nEl cr\u00e9dito lo necesita para comprar insumos para la panader\u00eda y para reparar la motocicleta en donde salen a vender, porque es la herramienta que ellos utilizan para poder distribuir el pan.\n\nSus sue\u00f1os son, tener su propia vivienda y que su hijo tenga una mejor calidad de vida.\n","en":"Heidi, age twenty, studied until the sixth grade.

The school does not have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children.  Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. \r\n\r\nThe loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nKasojo Preparatory School will repay its loan from school fees, which it collects each term.  Maurice ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration by reducing the number of children who fall sick from water-borne diseases, as well as

The group requires a micro-loan of Rs. 42,000 to construct toilets at their places. \r\n\r\nA toilet will mean privacy and peace of mind for Malathi and her family. It will also mean they no longer need to walk long distances, especially when they are sick.

She went to university but did not finish her degree. Now she is retired, and since 1993 has been farming in order to supplement her income. On her farm she has cows, 10 sheep, and a horse. On her 1.5 hectare plot she grows potatoes and beans for profit. In order to further grow her farm, she turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 100,000 KGS to purchase a cow to increase her milk output as well as two calves; a portion of the loan will also be used for cultivating the land.

Vairamani belongs to Kulithalai, in rural Tamil Nadu. She works as a daily wage labourer in the agriculture sector. She has four members of her family including two children. Her monthly saving is Rs. 2,050 only. She has no toilet at home or in the immediate vicinity. Vairamani\u2019s family is one of the millions affected by rural India's sanitation crisis. Without access to a toilet, they have to walk long distances to relieve themselves in the false privacy of dense bushes or isolated fields and hence are subsequently at risk of infection, molestation, and even insect or animal bites. \r\n\r\nJoining hands with Saritha and Adhilakshmi, whose families face similar problems due to a lack of sanitation facilities, Vairamani has formed a group of three members and is hoping to address this issue. Access to a toilet will mean privacy and peace of mind for Vairamani, Saritha and Adhilakshmi and their families.

While in college, he got a job digging irrigation ditches for a private owner of three houses to earn money for college. During this time, he lived with a host family who introduced him to the real estate business in San Diego and the social responsibility of making a profit. <br \/><br \/>Four years later, after studying real estate, his first real estate deal came from one of the houses he worked on. In 2004, he entered the real estate market as a sales agent, became a real estate broker in 2007, and eventually a partner in a real estate company. When the 2008 real estate market crashed, Clinton decided to return to school as a business student. He graduated with a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in International Business in 2012, and then in 2013 completed his Master\u2019s Degree. <br \/><br \/>Now that Clinton has completed his education, he felt it was time to get back into the real estate industry.  His wife Breonne will also be helping him run the business. She began her real estate career in 1998 as an administrative assistant for a top real estate agent in California, and spent a majority of her career in Mortgage Financing.  <br \/><br \/>Clinton and his wife will operate as real estate agents representing first-time home buyers with an emphasis on millennials and those of the Christian faith. The business will also provide notary services as needed. <br \/><br \/>Clinton will use his $2,000 Kiva loan to print marketing materials such as business cards and flyers, and for additional hard costs related to starting his business.

Joining hands with 3 others whose families all face similar problems due to a lack of sanitation facilities, Lalitha has formed a group with 3 other women and is hoping to address this issue. Without access to a toilet, their families walk long distances to relieve themselves in the false privacy of dense bushes or isolated fields. This puts them at risk of infection, molestation or attack, and even insect or animal bites.<br \/><br \/>Seeking to improve their situation, they seek a loan of Rs. 5600 to build toilets in their homes. As they begin to enjoy the benefits of basic sanitation and their families improve in health, they will be able to save on medical expenses.  Access to a toilet will mean privacy and peace of mind for Lalitha and family. It will also mean they no longer need to walk long distances, especially when they are sick. Your loan will help these 4 hardworking rural Indian families to access basic sanitation, and consequently, safety, improved health, medical savings, and improved productivity."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":72.23,"image":{"id":1958277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to construct toilets and improve sanitation facilities in their homes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Kulithalai","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":428,"posted_date":"2015-08-20T02:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-19T02:50:05Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pappathi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalitha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veeramani ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":42000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2017-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2017-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.12,"local_amount":2333.33,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:16:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2359.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731047105},{"amount":36.11,"local_amount":2333.33,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:17:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2359.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752135865}],"funded_date":"2015-09-10T17:24:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":934069,"name":"Maribel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mabel is 23 years old and is 1st of four children in the family.
