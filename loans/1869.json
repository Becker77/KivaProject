She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Eldoret, in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. For the past 5 years she has been involved in mixed farming and her main source of income has been growing maize, vegetables and tomatoes. She also keeps dairy cows. Irine has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. <br \/><br \/>Although she has made profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with the challenge of timely delivery of produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up; \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. Irine mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that helps aspiring women like her. <br \/><br \/>She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Irine is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to market has been a challenge, which is why she has suffered so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price, and through this loan Irine is going to achieve her dream and goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle but Irine feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help women so that they can gain respect and equality. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Irine will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market and also, she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market.

Kisinga Vocational School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 1000 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nKisinga Vocational School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

She is a daily wage labourer who works hard to make ends meet. Viji has no toilet at home or in the immediate vicinity. Viji's family is one of the millions affected by rural India's sanitation crisis. Joining hands with three others whose families all face similar problems due to a lack of sanitation facilities, Viji has formed a group and is hoping to address this issue. Without access to a toilet, her family members walk long distances to relieve themselves in the false privacy of dense bushes or isolated fields. Due to this lack of sanitation facilities, they are at risk of infection and fall ill often, spending a significant portion of their savings on medical expenses each month. The women and daughters in their families are exposed to the additional risk of molestation. \n\nAccess to a toilet will mean privacy and peace of mind for Viji and family.

At age 44, he spends every day of the week on his mixed farm, tirelessly working.  He is one of the most hardworking and dedicated men on planet earth. He is based in Kanyakine a remote village in the Nkubu area of Kenya. He is happily married to Lydia, who adds additional income to support their family. They have 3  children. <br \/><br \/>For the past 10 years he has been engaged in mixed farming, and through selling milk, eggs and a variety of food crops he has earned a decent income. Like many farmers in his village, he also plants trees on his farm to complement the region's natural forests. <br \/><br \/>Although Paul makes profits selling his farm produce at the market, the biggest challenge he faces is lack of water to irrigate his farm and water for home consumption. Paul comes from an area where there is no water connection and he is always forced to walk for a long distance for this \u201cprecious commodity.\" Paul faces challenges carrying water on his back because of his failing health. <br \/><br \/>Paul is seeking a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes. Most of the farmers in Kenya depend on rain-fed agriculture but Paul wants to change that notion and start irrigation farming. Through the loan he intends to harvest rain water (which always goes to waste) and store it in the tank. He intends to buy pipes that will be used to pump water from the river directly to his farm. With your loan, Paul will be saved the trouble of walking a long distance in search of water, and he will have enough water for home consumption. Irrigating his farm will boost productivity since water is an important requirement in the germination of crops. Paul is very excited about this project and hopes his dream will be achieved through the loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders. Increased productivity means increased income and this will translate to improved living standards. He will use the additional income to improve and secure the future of his children.

That makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk sales, she lacks a proper dairy unit and is seeking a loan to build one. A good dairy unit provides a place where cows can relax and also prevents them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. \r\n\r\nCatherine believes that through this loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have increased milk production.

Doris is a smallholder farmer from Chuka who has been practicing farming on a small inherited piece of land for the past six years. \r\n\r\nTo afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs and a variety of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in other small personal businesses. The Chuka area has a high demand for poultry products. Like many farmers from her region, Doris finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d \r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand that is really high. She lacks the funds to increase her poultry farm, so she is seeking a loan of 20,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being from a marginalized community, she finds that accessing funds is very challenging. However, through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. \r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will be able to provide more eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market.

Meet Lydia, 46 years of age, a very hardworking, honest, and dedicated farmer who lives in Gatwe, a remote village in Kerugoya. She is happily married and is blessed with three adorable children. \r\n\r\nLydia has been practicing mixed farming for the last five years and has gained much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in another small personal business. \r\n\r\nThe Kerugoya area is very populated and demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand, which is really high. \r\n\r\nShe lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 10,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman, accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and that she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. \r\n\r\nBeing a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and increase her poultry market to other markets and this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":15.13,"image":{"id":1959143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-20T17:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-19T17:30:06Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lydia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":707.73},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":728.41},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":749.7},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":771.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":794.16},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":817.37},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":841.26},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":865.84},{"due_date":"2016-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":891.15},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":917.19},{"due_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":944},{"due_date":"2016-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":971.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.08},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.72},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.94},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.17},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.41},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.66},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.91},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.17},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.44},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":7.56,"local_amount":756.46,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:24Z","rounded_local_amount":776.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024249},{"amount":7.57,"local_amount":756.87,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:28:59Z","rounded_local_amount":776.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112279}],"funded_date":"2015-08-20T18:08:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Margaret Rosen","image":null}},{"id":934534,"name":"Pascoela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pascoela is 53 years old.

Several years back she started her business with the goal of helping her husband economically with the needs at home as his income varies because he is a taxi driver. She was a member of a Woman's Bank, which had an excellent payback track record. She also had the need to have economic independence and feel good by socializing with other people. Her clients are neighbors, family members and other people in the community. <br \/>This is the third loan of the individual credit type and she has maintained an excellent habit of repayment. She is looking to grow and be able to contribute more to the household because she is going through a tough family situation. This motivates her to invest in a broader variety of jewelery and now even women's clothing in order to have more income and be able to meet her objectives.

She is 42 years old and from the province of Silang, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Edwin, an OFW (Overseas Filipino Worker), and they have two children who are both still in high school. Although her husband is an OFW, she thought of opening a small general store to keep herself busy and to earn extra income to adequately meet the growing needs of her family.<br \/><br \/>Marivic has been operating her store for three years already. Her earnings have greatly helped cover their daily needs. She sells dry and packaged commodities directly to consumers. All products are essential food items. She earns an income by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store means a lot to her since it has been their main source of income before her husband was an OFW. <br \/><br \/>To help her expand her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan to fill her store with canned goods, instant noodles, sugar, soda, candies, etc. Although there are times she has difficulty collecting her receivables from some of her customers, she still maintains her faith that they will have enough for their day-to-day needs. <br \/><br \/>Marivic dreams of having a big grocery store someday and finding more ways to increase their income. She wants her chidlen to finish their studies to allow them better opportunities in life.

On the main street they put up a pharmacy where she not only generates her income but also acts as a doctor. \"Since I was a little girl I always dreamed of one day becoming a doctor and helping everyone as much as possible, with determination and sacrifice it's what I've achieved\" are the words that moved her telling the story.\n\nDuring the four years she's had the pharmacy she's supported her parents with expenses to demonstrate her gratitude for all they've done for her. This is the first loan cycle for Edith with VF M\u00e9xico and she states that she would invest the loan to purchase ladies' underwear for a catalog, which is her other business. \n\nThe pharmacy's hours of operation are from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. She employs two people, each on different shifts. She says that if any customer needs consultation during the evening she gladly attends to them at her home or the patient's domicile. \"The most important thing is the patient and all doctors recognize the oath that we must respect.\"\n\nEdith's latest proposition is to have a franchise of pharmacies in communities that are difficult to access and to bring work to doctors that like her have the desire to help and support. \n\n\"Thank you for the ray of light you have given by granting a loan which will be the beginning of better things to come.\" The members of the group thank you for the new opportunity they have received.\n\n*The photograph was taken in the office where Abigail works and sells cosmetics.

Currently she is the head of the family and her children are in secondary school and depend on her. She started her business 7 years ago with the aim of obtaining income and be able to get ahead with her children. She is a woman with great leadership qualities and for this reason she was chosen as the president of the \"Banco Mujer Los Girasoles\" group. <br \/><br \/>She lives in a rural community called Maravilla where the main source of income is bananas. She works selling women's and men's clothing itinerantly as well as children's clothing. Things are going well and her clients are her community and the workers on the different banana farms in the community where she lives and the surrounding areas. <br \/><br \/>This group was formed a number of years ago as the woman that belong to it have common goals such as improving and expanding their business activities. They see an opportunity in the Fundaci\u00f3n to become successful in their businesses with the loans to support them. <br \/><br \/>Some of the members are the the head of their family but others have spouses or companions.

Six women came together so that they could gain access to credit and join to the Fundacion Mujer program.  This is their third loan and they have always responsibly made their payments by the agreed-upon date.  These women fit the requirements to continue participating in the Reglas de Oro program because because they see the opportunity to grow in their productive activities, and the majority of them are the heads of their households and count on a minimum contribution of child support for their children.  This is their main motivation to work hard so that they can move ahead with their children.  \r\n\r\nIleana is a single woman and mother of 4 children.  She lives in a common-law marriage with their father.  Three of her children are in secondary school and one is in primary school.  She started this business because she has a big family and the salary that her partner makes is too small to maintain her family.

as far as the eye can see. In her small but clean mud house, Martha, pictured above with her husband, has been able to raise her angelic looking children, who give her the determination to keep pushing on even when things get rough.<br \/><br \/>Thanks to practicing mixed farming, Martha can see a bright future. Each morning at 5:00 a.m., she arises to go to her farm in the remote village of Mukure. She passionately loves green house farming of vegetables and dairy farming, and has nicknames for her cows. Because of her great knowledge of farming, farmers from her village view her as a mentor.  However, the biggest challenge Martha faces is satisfying the overwhelming demand for milk in her village. <br \/><br \/>She is seeking a 102,000 KES loan through Kiva's field partner Juhudi Kilimo to buy another dairy cow of good quality. She believes that another cow will enable her to sell more milk, improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children.<br \/><br \/>Having gone through training with Juhudi Kilimo, Martha is confident that the skills she acquired will help her increase her business, and that she will be able to pay back the loan.

Currently, only one out of the 5 children is a minor and lives at home with her and her husband.  She has been married for approximately 30 years and she has always been dedicated to her family.  She is a hard-working woman with a great interest in growth at the personal, family, and business level.  <br \/><br \/>She started her bakery business because a nephew gave her the great idea, thanks to the fact that the community that she lives in doesn't have any bakeries, only general stores where bread is sold.  There isn't any competition for selling bread and fresh pastries in the rural area of Perlita where she lives.  The major source of employment is banana and pineapple plantations.  <br \/><br \/>The business is family-run, and she works there with her husband, a son, and a son-in-law who is the pastry chef.  The business is the principal source of income for her family.  She has experience raising animals, but she doesn't want to continue with that activity for various reasons.  They were able to sell a plot of land that they had and use the proceeds to build a shop and to buy part of the machinery and primary materials necessary to undertake the business.  <br \/><br \/>They have contracts to sell bread and pastries in different general stores in the surrounding communities and with small restaurants on some of the banana plantations in her community.  Her customers are also from the community since they prefer to eat something delicious and fresh.  <br \/><br \/>This is the first time that she is requesting financing to reinforce her business.

Jane is totally a life warrior - despite not securing a formal job she goes out every day to work in her small farm, showing that women are also involved in farming. Jane decided that she would be independent and contribute to her community by practicing mixed farming.<br \/> <br \/>Jane is married and blessed with three lovely children who she refers to as \u201cmy heart beat.\u201d Her primary sources of income are selling milk, pig farming, and some personal business that she does to supplement her meager income. Deciding to practice pig farming was not a difficult decision for Jane. She has earned a decent income from pig farming for six years. The demand is overwhelming and she wants to increase the number of pigs, but the biggest challenge is lack of funds, so she seeks a loan to purchase additional pigs.<br \/> <br \/>Pig farming has become one of the most important aspects of agriculture in Kenya, because it creates business opportunities for entrepreneurs and it\u2019s a kind of business that will always be needed. Pig farming is a less strenuous activity and it is profitable. Many pig farmers find a sense of fulfillment having pigs all over their homestead.

You\u2019ll see this in every barrio, barangay or even in cities. You can find here a variety of items that can be bought at a cheap price since they sell items by volume, kilos or by the piece. Sari-sari stores are rampant in the Philippines since Filipinos can take care of their family while doing the business. Most sari-sari stores are located in the comfort of their own home where they just put up a grill or screen as a protection against theft. In front, you\u2019ll see products hanging such as biscuits, candies, and snack foods to attract customers. <br \/><br \/>Elma is engaged on this type of business. She has been a 58 year old, Center for Community Transformation (CCT) partner since January 20, 2010 and a dedicated member as well.  She\u2019s managed her own sari-sari store business for 10 years now and also a videoke business. It\u2019s another business in the Philippines where people rent equipment which includes a television, a videoke machine and a catalogue where you\u2019ll find hundreds of songs to choose from. Each song has an equivalent number. Once the number is entered in the machine the chosen song will be played with a subtitle. Since Filipinos love to sing, at every celebration they include renting a videoke machine, so that\u2019s why the business is growing. Her estimated earnings are PHP 28,000 every month.<br \/><br \/>Elma believes that CCT helps aspiring entrepreneurs in their businesses by granting loan requests.

She has five children who are her greatest motivation in life to persevere, because she wants to provide for them a better future. Elizabeth was unable to study to get a professional career because of the economic situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming for the past 10 years. Elizabeth always says, \u201cI have always had an affinity for farming, and it runs in my blood.\u201d <br \/><br \/>She is able to get between 10 and 15 liters of milk a day and this helps her support crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements and that is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements.
