In the future she would like to open a restaurant or maybe, since her daughter is a beautician, a beauty salon. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":276465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy soft drinks, beer and candy.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Los Olivos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.851111 -76.390556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-02-22T19:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":160,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":104.32,"local_amount":95.38,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":104.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27084914},{"amount":70.68,"local_amount":64.62,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-25T07:45:48Z","rounded_local_amount":70.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44439282}],"funded_date":"2009-02-22T20:12:07Z","paid_date":"2009-06-25T07:45:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Molly Puglisi","image":null}},{"id":95079,"name":"Dominika","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dominika M. is 35 years old and married, with three children ages 15, 6 and 3.

D. is 36 years old and is married with four children.  She sells vegetables.  Katia\u2019s husband works as a motorcycle taxi driver.  \r\n\r\nKatia has been working with Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for three years and belongs to the communal bank \u201cMadres Coraje\u201d (Mothers with Courage).  Katia plans to invest this loan of 1000 soles in local agricultural products to sell at her vegetable stand.

She lives with her husband and children in a rented apartment in a town called Kade. Most of the town's inhabitants are involved in farming and other trading activities. Esther is in the fish selling business. She buys smoked fish from nearby fishing communities, then hawks her goods in her own community as well as selling at the local market. Esther has been in this business for 15 years. She hopes to obtain a loan to procure goods in bulk in order to expand her business. She believes the loan will help her inject more working capital into her trade in order to enable her to make enough income to support her family and ensure her children's education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":426121,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fish in bulk for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Kade","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":88,"posted_date":"2009-11-15T03:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":116.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:56:22Z","rounded_local_amount":119.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110760339},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-04T09:22:59Z","rounded_local_amount":119.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118149041},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-26T07:59:20Z","rounded_local_amount":119.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123987177},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-18T08:26:57Z","rounded_local_amount":119.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129017848},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-20T08:21:36Z","rounded_local_amount":119.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136742684},{"amount":83.32,"local_amount":116.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:02:14Z","rounded_local_amount":119.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144775467}],"funded_date":"2009-11-18T15:23:18Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T10:02:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":156719,"name":"Tapaga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tapaga L. is a 41-year-old woman living in the town of Taga.

His shoemaking business began when he was still a young boy and he used to help his father.  This was his first training in this field, where he learned how to be on his own.  Later on, he worked for several shoemaking companies where he deepened his knowledge and experience.  However, his salary as an employee was not sufficient because he wanted to be independent.  \r\n\r\nHe took the leap and started his own business.  It was quite an effort but, for the last four years, he has had his own cobbler\u2019s shop where he manufactures shoes for women, men and children.  He works based on prior orders from his customers.  Antonio designs the shoes according to the latest fashions and his customer\u2019s needs and wishes.  His greatest challenge is to be up-to-date on innovations so that he can always be on the cutting edge of his field so he must be aware of what\u2019s in the latest kraft journals, he must visit shoe stores, observe artists, and do whatever is necessary to be tuned into supply, demand, and the latest fashions, in order to offer his customers the very best.\r\n\r\nAntonio is 35 years old and is a cheerful and calm person.  He lives in his own house, which is in Atl\u00e1ntico department.  He\u2019s married and has two children, 11 and 14 years old, who he wants to see intensely studying so that they may become professionals with opportunities for well-being.  He wants his business to grow because that represents improving his family\u2019s standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation; he\u2019s asking for $1.500.000 which will be used to buy raw materials in larger quantities such as, synthetic strap material, soles, leather, toe pieces, especially glue-on.  He hopes some day to have his own line of shoes and is gradually preparing himself for that end.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":481811,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To buy shoemaking raw materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-02-02T06:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonio Jos\u00e8","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109233},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113592},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115958},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118374},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120840},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123358},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125928},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128551},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131229},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133963},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":136754},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142220}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.44},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.69},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.91},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.16},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.74},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.06},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.42},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.8},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.21},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":56.44,"local_amount":109233,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":111745.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949034},{"amount":58.69,"local_amount":113592,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":116204.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677823},{"amount":59.91,"local_amount":115958,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:59Z","rounded_local_amount":118625.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712197},{"amount":61.16,"local_amount":118374,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":121096.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895702},{"amount":62.43,"local_amount":120840,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":123619.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636027},{"amount":128.8,"local_amount":249286,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:18Z","rounded_local_amount":255019.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410760},{"amount":203.43,"local_amount":393743,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":402799.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688027},{"amount":144.14,"local_amount":278974,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":285390.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000687}],"funded_date":"2010-02-02T10:28:12Z","paid_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":177535,"name":"Wilson","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wilson M. is a young entrepreneur who is 31 years old.

He is very experienced and has the special skills in livestock care that help him to develop his business. He raises and sells livestock and sells meat and milk. \r\n\r\nMuzafar is requesting a loan of 5,000 Somoni to enable him to purchase a second dairy cow. The second cow will enable him to increase the milk produced and will provide income security to the family when one of the cows is with calf.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The fifteen women know each other well, living as neighbors in a rural village just outside of Chimaltenango.  Now, in addition to being neighbors, they are learning to become confidants and support each other in business, sharing ideas for success, and helping one another overcome obstacles.  After the success of their first loan, other women took note and have joined the group. The veteran members will teach them about solidarity and responsibility within the group. They are confident of their ability to repay, and excited to take on this new challenge. <\/P> \r\n\r\n<P>All fifteen women are weavers, crafting beautiful \"huipiles,\" the traditional Mayan blouse, whose intricate designs reveal a woman\u2019s hometown, marital status, or beliefs.  A single huipil C. take up to three months to produce, working all day.  After an initial investment of about $30-$50, it C. be sold for up to $200.  The women also save money by weaving for themselves, rather than buying from others.<\/P>  \r\n\r\n<P>They are asking for a loan of 24,000 quetzales, about $3150 USD, with which they will purchase thread in bulk to weave the huipiles, as well as skirts and belts and other crafts. Some of the women sell their weaving in markets in the nearby town of Chimaltenango, and most are well known in their own village and receive orders from friends and neighbors.  Buying in bulk drastically lowers the cost of thread, and it also cuts back on the trips that must be made to the market to buy materials, saving on time and travel expenses.<\/P>      \r\n\r\n<P>The women are excited about their loan and the possibility of better providing for their families. They dream of being able to support their children in school past 6th grade, opening up opportunities for them that will help stop the cycle of poverty within their families.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>(The two

Thi Mai, 46 years old, has been participating in the Fund for 5 years.  In the beginning, she borrowed 700,000 VND to invest in raising livestock.  Besides livestock, the family also has a very stable income stream from her husband's field tilling service.  With an income of 3,000,000 VND\/month, Mrs. Mai's family is seeing a steady improvement in their quality of life.  Her two children can also go to school.  In this round of funding she would like to borrow 10,000,000 VND to invest in a water pump and a new tilling machine to provide better service for the locals.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from

The goal of Margarita is to stock her store and improve her house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amy Schapiro, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":444456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"The purchase of a cart","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-01-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:06:24Z","rounded_local_amount":500.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118118526},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:41Z","rounded_local_amount":250.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954300},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:55:00Z","rounded_local_amount":250.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987304}],"funded_date":"2010-01-02T08:27:22Z","paid_date":"2010-04-23T07:55:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Schapiro","image":null}},{"id":165007,"name":"Ana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana P. is 32 and married with 6 children.  She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Ana has many years of experience in this business.  Ana needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 750 talas or US $313 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nAna joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ana's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Ana P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Lan has successfully repaid a previous loan of 30,749,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future.  She is now requesting a new loan of 3,079,800 VND which will be used to purchase more baby livestock to raise and sell.

and other businesses needing excellent customer specialists.   LaToya has hired a staff with extensive experience in customer service and LaToya herself has experience working in the call center industry.  Their combined experience gives Prosperous Staffing the know-how to be the bridge connecting the gap between employer and employee.  With many companies operating call centers in Houston, LaToya recognized the opportunity for a niche staffing agency that knows the ins and outs of the industry.  \r\n\r\nLaToya is using this loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana to purchase business cards, brochures, workers compensation insurance, and to update her business\u2019 website.  When LaToya first opened Prosperous Staffing in 2009, she relied solely on her savings to get the business up and running.  Looking back, she realizes that a lack of financing prevented her from starting the business with enough resources to be effective, which is why she turned to ACCION Texas-Louisiana after temporarily closing her business.   This loan gave her the means to re-launch and aggressively advertise her business.  Having just celebrated the re-launching of her business on May 2, LaToya is running her business full-time and has engaged the help of a part-time recruiter and a part time field worker.  \r\n\r\nLaToya credits her parents with giving her the confidence to be a small business owner.  After working for years in Corporate America, she decided it was time for her to create her own opportunity.  LaToya is utilizing the business counseling services offered by the Houston Minority Supplier Diversity Council and the Women\u2019s Business Enterprise Association for networking and instruction in business development.  LaToya\u2019s goal is to establish Prosperous Staffing as the premier staffing agency for call centers in the greater-Houston area.  When the time comes, she will expand Prosperous Staffing to other markets where call centers have a strong presence.   \r\n\r\nCheck out LaToya\u2019s website at http:\/\/www.prosperousstaffing.com

This is because cheese is the base for many delicious foods, and it is also used as finger food during Christmas and New Year's parties. She has the following message for Kiva lenders:\r\n\"Thank you for supporting me. In return, I will be punctual with my repayments.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":576515,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

She has been doing it to increase family's income. Her husband's income is Rp700,000.00 (about US$77)\/month. That amount is certainly not sufficient. Daily expenses are about Rp30,000.00 (about $3.30), rent for house and food stall. Although her 2 children are independent, she has to work. The rice stall business gives her gross profit of Rp100,000 (about $11). The distance she has to take between her house and her rice stall is about 2 km.  Her rice stall location is quite strategic. One factor is that the road is quite busy. That fact is also supported that the food Sadwathi sells are liked by her customers. Also the many building laborers working around Sadwathi's food-stall. Raw materials prices are quite high, but this mother relies on capital to buy enough raw materials. The to be obtained loan would be used to add to her capital.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nSadwathi memiliki usaha warung nasi. Dia menekuni usaha ini untuk menambah penghasilan keluarga. Penghasilan suaminya per bulan Rp 700.000,00. Uang sejumlah itu tentu saja masih belum mencukupi. Biaya hidup per hari Rp 30.000,00, kontrakkan baik untuk rumah maupun untuk warung nasinya. Walaupun kedua anaknya sudah mandiri, dia harus bekerja. Usaha warung nasinya ini memberikan keuntungan kotor per hari mencapai Rp 100.000,00. Jarak yang harus dia tempuh dari rumah menuju warung \u00b1 2 km. Letak warung nasinya cukup strategis. Salah satu faktornya jalur yang melewatinya cukup ramai. Hal tersebut juga didukung oleh makanan yang dijual Sadwathi diminati oleh pelanggan. Hasilnya penjualannya pun sangat bagus. Hal ini ditambah dengan banyaknya buruh bangunan yang bekerja di sekitar warung Sadwathi. Harga bahan baku sekarang memang cukup tinggi, tapi ibu ini memanfaatkan modal yang ada untuk membeli bahan baku yang cukup. Pinjaman yang dia peroleh akan dia manfaatkan untuk menambah modal yang sudah dia miliki."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":75630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy rice, vegetable and spices\r\n<p>Membeli beras, sayur, dan bumbu.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Badung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.5 115.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-16T23:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nyoman Sadwathi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-31T00:30:41Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":125,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-23T04:27:51Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-31T10:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85266},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-31T08:48:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-31T10:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":105300},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-30T03:01:42Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-31T10:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124114},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-31T10:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144905},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-31T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-31T10:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":169889}],"funded_date":"2007-10-17T00:30:41Z","paid_date":"2008-03-31T10:05:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":25456,"name":"Aisha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aisha is a small entrepreneur owning a pharmacy shop.

In order to overcome this situation, Yarlin Yohanna purchased a solar panel, and therefore, she seeks the support of CEPRODEL, which she hopes will provide her with a loan that will allow her to finish paying the solar panel , which she and her family use to get their at their humble home.\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Antonella Sacconi, Kiva Volunteer, <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<div align='justify'> \r\nYarlng Johanna es habitante del municipio de Achuapa en la ciudad de Le\u00f3n teniendo su negocio de agricultura dedic\u00e1ndose a la siembra de semilla en su localidad.

Al querer superar esta situaci\u00f3n ha adquirido un panel solar y para ello muy responsablemente busca apoyo en CEPRODEL para obtener un cr\u00e9dito que le permita cancelar la deuda del panel y

Her food stand is quite popular in her neighborhood and has enabled her to save enough to establish a general store adjacent to her house. She also makes and sells banana cue. Banana cue is made of fried bananas on skewers that are coated with sugar and cooked until the sugar caramelizes.\r\n\r\nThe income her business generates helps her cover household expenses. Over the years, she has been able to pay to build her house and to create a savings for future security. Although she's been in this business for over 20 years now, she still enjoys managing the daily activities. She now earns about PHP 9,000 per month. Her last loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon was her 19th one and she borrowed PHP 19,500, which she used as additional capital for her business. This time around, she intends to borrow PHP 22,000 for her 20th cycle to reinvest further into her food vending business.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

She owns a business venture, selling traditional handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Faasaveve has many years of experience in this business.  Faasaveve needs a loan of WST $1000 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 tala or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Faasaveve joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faasaveve's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faasaveve T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He has a few physical laborers to help provide his service. He receives a lot of orders from his clients to construct their houses. \r\n\r\nHe has another partner in his wife, who appears in the picture above. She sells meat to people who eat it with beer or wine in the village. \r\n\r\nMr. Suon N. has three children, one of whom is married and lives independently, and the other two are students and dependent on him.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Their three children are all in school: with one in college, another in high school, and the youngest in elementary.\r\n\r\nNerissa finished midwifery but chose to do a business related to transportation. They presently own vehicles which are for hire, mainly by companies. Nerissa also has a small business in rag-making. Altogether, the net earnings of the family per month amount to P11,960. \r\n\r\nNerissa is applying for a loan of P12,000, which she plans to use to register two of her vehicles to be officially used in business. She would also use the loan to improve the conditions of the vehicles by changing the color and adding some accessories.\r\n\r\nAt present, Nerissa finds the daily collections from the business difficult. Sometimes, the vehicles are penalized for violation, which adds up expenses. At times, the vehicles get damaged and need repairs. However, Nerissa still hopes and believes that God has destined her for a greater purpose. She dreams to own a bigger business with more vehicles that would cater to many more companies in Metro Manila and beyond. She also hopes that her rag-making business will increase in sales. She aims for these breakthroughs in business because, at the bottom line, she aspires to buy her family their own house and lot.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":584502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Towards vehicle registration and maintenance.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-08-17T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nerissa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2012-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":11.46,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:57:00Z","rounded_local_amount":518.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166821736},{"amount":11.46,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:53:09Z","rounded_local_amount":518.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172088980},{"amount":126.04,"local_amount":5500,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:39Z","rounded_local_amount":5699.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380346},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2072.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816688},{"amount":80.21,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:54Z","rounded_local_amount":3627.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652671}],"funded_date":"2010-08-17T06:43:49Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":227066,"name":"Rahimjon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"M.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She\u2019s married and has two children who are 16 and 8 years of age; both go to school.  Her husband is a merchant.   She\u2019s been in the communal bank for three cycles and she likes it because the loans have been improving her life day to day.\r\n\r\nShe is taking out this loan to build a small cistern in her house so that they\u2019ll never lack water, this so vital liquid that is not available in this sector.  She tells us that in this part of the city water does not arrive through pipes but rather it must be purchased and stored in small tanks.

She studied at school until fourth grade.  The reason she had so little education was the death of her parents when she was still a child.  She is a single mother and has four children, 16, 10, 8 and 5 years old, respectively.  She lives in her own house.\r\n\r\nMatilde has been a merchant for more than five years and owns her own business.  Learning this trade was a matter of survival.  She sells fresh produce in the local market and her daily sales vary between 500 MT and 700 MT.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan.  She has never worked with other microfinancing institutions, but has only worked with Hluvuku.  With this loan she plans to increase the volume of her merchandise and diversify the products she sells.\r\n\r\nIn the future, she plans to have indoor plumbing and to build a weather-proof wall for her home.  She counts on having more loans from Hluvuku.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Heidi Petersen, Kiva

She owns a business venture, selling pork products in the local community.  Nia has 3 years of experience in this business.  Nia needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nia joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Nia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Nia T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Rajabboy owns a large piece of land where he cultivates different kinds of vegetables, but due to the poor quality of the soil and the insects, he is no longer able to satisfy market demand.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She decided to start this business in order to support her three children who are most important and what motivate her to keep going.

make a living. \u201cI get so excited about making bags. I never thought I could do it as a real job!\u201d Jennifer, of Jendarling Bags, began designing and producing bags in 2008 in the scarce free time her 9-5 job afforded her. Over the past three years, her hobby has quickly turned into an all-consuming endeavor: she debuted her first collection at the London Fashion Week, at an Ethical Fashion event, at The Hospital Club, and she has been featured by local news sources such as DailyCandy, Treehugger and San Francisco\u2019s beloved local magazine, 7X7.  \r\n\r\nJen\u2019s one-of-a-kind bags are a reflection of her diverse background and interests. With degrees ranging from nonprofit management and business to working at an environmental agency, she drew from each of these experiences when developing her company. \r\n\r\nAs a businesswoman and an environmentalist, Jen prides herself on her business\u2019 commitment to sustainability: various collections incorporate sustainable efforts such as using local, fair trade and organic materials. Many of the zippers are nickel-free, and she relies on mostly reclaimed materials for the bags. All of the leather comes from nearby Napa and is manufactured right here in the Bay Area, supporting local jobs and reducing the carbon footprint inherent in outsourcing. \r\n\r\nJen recently landed a partnership to sell her bags in a high-end retail store. \u201cI was thrilled to land this account because it will open my business to a whole new array of clients!\u201d said Jen. However, when the retailer placed two orders for June and July, Jen realized she did not have the capital she would need to purchase nine different colors of leather to fill this large order.\r\n\r\nJen knew that her bank would not be interested in giving her the small loan amount she needed, nor would it be able to provide her a quick turnaround. Having learned about Opportunity Fund at San Francisco\u2019s Small Business Week, she turned to the local microlender and was approved for a loan within days. This loan of $3,000 will help her to secure the large order with her new partner, affording her the opportunity to grow her business.\r\n\r\nJen takes pride in her fabrics, her mission and her commitment to sustainability. She dreams one day of opening up her own boutique devoted to the same values.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3000,"image":{"id":811470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to pay for more materials to make her handbags.

At this time, she is working hard to send her daughter to school to finish her degree.\r\n\r\nRosejean oversees operations of their jeepney (see footnote) transportation business. They have a jeepney that has a capacity of 18 persons, which is paying a boundary (daily quota) of 1,000 each day. Rosejean\u2019s husband drives the jeepney. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 20,000 loan. She will use he loan to buy new tires for the jeepneys, and renew her registration. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRosejean dreams that her child will finish her education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n-Curiously, Jeepneys have purely American origins. They were first used by American soldiers helping the Philippines throw off the invading Japanese. Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for every day travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain. Now, the jeepneys are one of the things that makes the Philippines truly Philippines.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Living in North-Iraq, Shahla is not only taking care of her business, but she is also a mother of 5 children and as such truly understands the meaning of multitasking and time management. \n\nShahla is 48 years old and is currently managing her beauty salon located in the refurbished, street-front garage of her building. The spotless, colorful, yet in many ways modest salon meets clients' hair, beauty and make up needs with the help of her staff.\n\nShahla understands that building a clientele differs from keeping them and it is her priority to make sure her returning clients receive something new from time to time with constantly improving care. To facilitate her investments she took a loan in the past from Relief International Microfinance Iraq, which she used for purchasing a machine for facial treatments. Shahla successfully repaid the past loan. She decided to take a new loan, this time in the amount of USD 7000 to purchase high quality raw materials for her work. Also Shahala would like to move her salon away from her home to a new location. She has already made plans for the move which is expected to take place around August, and will use part of the loan for the miscellaneous costs of the move and make improvements to the salon.\n\nRelief International Microfinance Iraq provides qualified clients with a loan product specifically tailored for Small and Medium Enterprises (or SMEs). Select SME entrepreneurs, featured on Kiva, are participants of the program \"WLIFT: Leveraging the Internet for Financial Transformation\", developed for women in Iraq in a partnership between Kiva, Relief International, and the Cherie Blair Foundation. In addition to receiving credit, these female entrepreneurs also benefit from targeted technical assistance and ongoing mentoring designed to stimulate growth in their businesses.\n\nBased on the political and social challenges of lending in Iraq, personally identifiable information about this borrower has been altered for their protection.

SPBD development programs and training assisted this family with knowledge, not only in financial assistance, but also with Victoria\u2019s savings plan as she saves $10 each day from her business operation and $25 for her family\u2019s basic needs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":16571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase barbeque stove, turkey tails, chicken, sausages, taro, and a pot; and cement, sand, timber, iron roof, and nails for the stand\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"WS","country":"Samoa","town":"Moamoa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.8 -171.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":15,"posted_date":"2007-03-02T02:50:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vitoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-19T05:40:43Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1150,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2007-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2007-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2007-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2007-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2007-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2007-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2007-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2007-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":95.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-05-02T23:43:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14661},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-05T22:26:36Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20508},{"amount":192,"local_amount":192,"processed_date":"2007-07-19T09:15:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":192,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":33491},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-19T09:15:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44234},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-19T09:15:29Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":56246},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-19T09:15:39Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":69239},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-11-19T10:16:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":83411},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-12-19T10:16:04Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99152},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2008-01-19T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":117885},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2008-02-19T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137986},{"amount":94,"local_amount":94,"processed_date":"2008-03-19T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":160982}],"funded_date":"2007-03-05T06:40:43Z","paid_date":"2008-03-19T10:02:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":9103,"name":"Lemalie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lemalie S. is thirty eight years old and has five children.

Married with two children, he made the decision to seek a place to live and have a workshop.<p>\r\n\r\nThe money that he was able to save was enough to acquire land in the high area and he also bought some very rustic, small artisan weaving machines.  He still works with them because his budget is not enough.  Now there are seven members of his household: him, his wife, their four children and his brother who came to the town and asked him for work.<p>\r\n\r\nHis artisan weavings are made with Alpaca, Ovino and Llama wool.  They have a good finish and it is because of this that his market is basically the exclusive areas of the capital that recognize the quality of the product and pay a fair price.

As such, she, alongside her husband, have dedicated themselves for the past 5 years to the sale of regional fruit.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

His house is made from cement but it needs work.\r\n\r\nDavid has always enjoyed driving.  Some years ago now he had the opportunity to rent a car to use as a taxi.  Little by little with effort and through working late nights in the streets of Guayaquil, he was able to purchase his own car.  He works from 7.00am until 9.00pm every day, driving around the streets of Guayaquil.  He has regular clients who call him when they need transport.\r\n\r\nWith his loan, he would like to purchase cement, stones and paint in order to be able to improve his house so that his wife and daughters can live well.  In the future, he would like to continue working as a taxi driver so that he can provide his daughters with a stable

She is unemployed, married, and has 6 children. Her husband does not have a permanent job, and is not able to earn enough money to support their family. Peata's biggest worry has been the school fees for her 4 children attending school and other basic needs for her family. She opted for starting the business, because cakes are cheap to make, and because the business would not much interfere with her busy schedule as a full time mother. In addition, pork cakes are a favourite among the locals, especially children. To start out, Peata bought flour and meat, and now makes about 40 buns daily, 7 days a week. She sells the cakes to school children during the week and to other village people during the weekends. Occasionally, Peata's husband delivers the cakes to nearby shops.  She earns up to  280 tala (US$90) a week, and is now able to cover the family's basic needs in addition to paying her children\u2019s school fees.

Faasu has been engaged in this business for over four years and earns approximately 600 WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Faasu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Her goal was to help improve her living situation and to increase her ability to engage in business activities. Faasu has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise.  \r\n<p>\r\nFaasu is now requesting a new loan of 1,800 WST, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise. The loan will be the third loan she has taken out from SPBD. Faasu plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

The bank is located in one of the most beautiful places that the city Cuenca has, which is about 20 minutes outside of the city.  Being the viewpoint of Cuenca, it is visited by natives and foreigners coming here to admire the beauty of the enclosed city.\r\n\r\nTur\u00ed Centro is comprised of a group of enterprising women who have found the formula to get ahead in their households and in their businesses.  They serve as an examples of success and perseverance.  They are:\r\n\r\nGladis Esperanza I. C. is a member of the Tur\u00ed Centro Communal Bank in the city of Cuenca.  She is 43, and she has five children who are 23, 21, 19, 17, and 14.  Her oldest child is outside of the country.  He migrated to the exterior to give his family a better future.  Her second daughter is married and making her own home.  Only three of her children live in her home.  One of her daughters enrolled this year in the State University of Cuenca.  Her two last children study in the T\u00e9cnico Tur\u00ed school.  She has been divorced for four years, and they live in their own home.\r\n\r\nGladis raises small animals like chickens and guinea pigs.  She also does the household chores.  She has been raising animals for six years, and it is going very well.  She tells us that the earnings are dependent upon how much is invested.  And that can vary because not all of the chickens are raised, some die.  But, she is happy because this business supports her household.\r\n\r\nThis is her second cycle working with the Foundation, although she did withdraw for a while.  The money that she gets now from the ESPOIR Foundation will be used for food for the chickens (ground, balanced) and the guinea pigs.\r\n\r\nHer future goal is to keep growing with her business of raising animals and giving her children a better today and tomorrow.\r\n\r\nTania Paola M. C. is also an active member of the Turi Centro Bank.  She lives in the Centro de Tur\u00ed in the viewpoint of Cuenca.  She is 30 and happily married.  Her three children; 12, 9, and 7, are testaments to their love.  Her oldest child goes to the Miguel Merch\u00e1n school.  The last two goes to the Pr\u00edncipe de Paz school.  Her husband works as a carpenter.  Being her friend, they are inseperable in the moments of pain and happiness.  They rent where they live because they do not have the money to buy or build their own house.\r\n\r\nTania studied tailoring and passed to the second year.  She sells clothes two day a week.  On Wednesdays she sells in the free marked in a space her mother gives her.  On Saturday she buys all her clothing stock for her business.  One of her biggest difficulties is not having her own place.  She has to inconvenience her mother a little bit.  The advantage is that working with her mother she knows lots of people, and she gets new customers each time.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is asking the foundation for is to buy merchandise to increase her business and to have a large stock for her demanding customers.\r\n\r\nHer future goal is to be a tailoring teacher and to continue with her clothing business.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Patricia is another active member of the Turi Centro Communal Bank.  She was previously a member of another bank that broke up.  She is 39, and she has been separated for seven years.  She lives with her four children.  Her ex husband gives her child support only when her remembers.\r\n\r\nElizabeth works in the market on Thursdays and Sundays selling a great variety of fruit.  She starts at six in the morning and works until nine at night.  She has been doing this for five years.  The rest of the week she devotes to her home.  The greatest difficulty she has is when sales drop and she barely gets enough money to cover the debts that she owes.  When sales are good, she gets income to invest in her business and for the daily sustenance of her household.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth cycle working with the ESPOIR Foundation.  She previously was a member of another communal bank that broke up.  The money she is asking for is to buy more fruit to better stock and improve her stand because there is a lot of competition.\r\n\r\nElizabeth\u2019s dream for the future is to succeed in her business and to be able to educate her children until they become good professionals.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

It has four branches and three units with offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":405575,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, selling puletasi (Samoan formal wear).  Fagaitaua has 2 years of experience in this business.  Fagaitaua needs a loan of WST $1250 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nFagaitaua joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Fagaitaua's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Fagaitaua F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:
