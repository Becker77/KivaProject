Mercy is hardworking and always says, \u201cI eat from my sweat.\u201d Her primary source of income has been milk, eggs and crops. <br \/><br \/>Most of the small holder farmers in her village own approximately half an acre per household and this has made them work extra hard to fully utilize their farms. Mercy has been practicing mixed farming and she enjoys the income she gets, but she has been facing challenges delivering her products to the market. Eldoret town is a very remote area and the roads are in pathetic condition; this has hampered Mercy from making timely delivery of products to the market while still fresh. Mercy sells vegetables, milk and tomatoes which are very perishable and require quick delivery if you are to fetch a high price. <br \/><br \/>Mercy is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike that will help her deliver her products to the market in a timely way so she can overcome the challenge of facing losses. Through the loan she will deliver the products in a timely manner to the market, and this means she will never suffer losses, which will translate into an immediate increase in profits. Mercy plans to employ someone who will help her on the farm and deliver products to her large client base. Profits from the loan will be used to comfortably repay the loan fully and invest in a solid foundation for her family to come."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":64.34,"image":{"id":1959415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike to deliver her products to the market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-20T23:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-19T23:30:01Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2933.06},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3018.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3107},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3197.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3291.26},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3387.45},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3486.44},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3588.34},{"due_date":"2016-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3693.2},{"due_date":"2016-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3801.14},{"due_date":"2016-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3912.23},{"due_date":"2016-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4026.56},{"due_date":"2016-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4144.24},{"due_date":"2016-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4265.35},{"due_date":"2016-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4390.01},{"due_date":"2016-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4518.3},{"due_date":"2017-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4650.35},{"due_date":"2017-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4786.26},{"due_date":"2017-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4926.04},{"due_date":"2017-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5070.1},{"due_date":"2017-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5218.28},{"due_date":"2017-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5370.78},{"due_date":"2017-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5527.74},{"due_date":"2017-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5689.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.6},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.43},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.29},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.18},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.09},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.03},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.99},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.99},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.01},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.06},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.14},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.26},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.41},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.59},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.8},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.05},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.34},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.03},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.43},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.88},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.36},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.9},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.13,"local_amount":2782.67,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2796.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024256},{"amount":37.21,"local_amount":3816.47,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3835.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112284}],"funded_date":"2015-09-18T20:22:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miranda A","image":984688}},{"id":934745,"name":"Nayfa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nayfa is a 53 years old housewife; she is responsible for her daughter\u2019s education.

She is a hardworking woman and lives in the area of Nkubu. It is a thriving area full of people like Joyce, who, with entrepreneurship and honest work, make this remote town a better place. Joyce counts herself lucky to have had a supported childhood. She managed to clear her primary education. She studied two years of high school education before having to drop out and help her family in farm work. <br \/><br \/>She started farming in 2011 on a 3.5 acre piece of run-down land with the help of her loving husband. If you visit the farm today, you will find bananas, vegetables, cows, hens and trees. Not only is Joyce concerned about the productivity of the land today, she is also worried about the changes in climate caused by human activities. She makes it up by planting more trees always. <br \/><br \/>Joyce is seeking a loan to purchase irrigation equipment for her farm. She is planning to expand her banana farming but she cannot count on steady rainfall. However, with an irrigation kit in place, she will be able to consistently supply water to her plants on a regular basis. This will ensure the bananas grow green and healthy.

In this way, Aury will see the completion of her dream become closer, which is to have a well-established business but in a place independent from her house.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":76.92,"image":{"id":1956034,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy feed concentrate to feed the birds and to buy more chickens and pigs to allow her to take good advantage of the space that she has available.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Sahagun","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2015-08-21T03:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-20T03:10:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aury Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.19,"local_amount":143400,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":149704.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731020916},{"amount":26.73,"local_amount":76364,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":79721.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752109067}],"funded_date":"2015-09-15T14:43:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":934728,"name":"Maribel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maribel, aged 43, is married with four children.

Together with her husband, she works with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started this in 2013 with the purchase of livestock for 25,000 som (KGS). <br \/><br \/>Thanks to Indira's persistent work, her farm currently has a cow, 50 sheep and two horses. She also processes 1.85 hectares of land, where she mainly grows haricots. The harvest she gets she sells wholesale. She also sells ecological milk from the cows and horses.

He has taken advantage of this experience to open a blacksmith's shop in his home, offering services like iron enclosure construction, railings, window grates, gates, and other protection for the home.

Meet Harriet, a 38-year-old smallholder farmer who always brings a pleasant feeling when she is at home. She hails from the Chuka area of Kenya, an area that is a city of champions because of producing so many elite athletes. Being a mother comes with lots of responsibility, and feeding her large family requires a lot of hard work; hence, Harriet has to put in extra effort to comfortably take care of her family. \r\n\r\nHarriet started farming just after finishing high school since she never advanced her education. Because of the high unemployment rate, she ventured into farming, and she has never regretted this because of the profits she has been making. Harriet practices mixed farming and is regarded as one of the hardest working farmers in her village because she is able to juggle between keeping pigs and also doing crop farming. \r\n\r\nHarriet is a visionary and enterprising person and has always wanted to do pig farming on a large scale, but one of the challenges she has faces is lack of capital.\r\n \r\nThat is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy additional pigs. The Chuka area has the highest demand for pork meat and through this loan, Harriet is going to sell her pork meat to the nearby market and also to her neighbours. \r\n\r\nOther than pork meat, she will also benefit from the manure from the pigs waste which will save her the cost that she used to incur buying fertilizers.\r\n\r\nThrough the loan, Harriet is confident that her life will be transformed and her dream of providing a secure future for her family will be achieved. Harriet is relieved to know that her life can be secured through partners such as Kiva who help small-scale and aspiring women such as Harriet.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50.83,"image":{"id":1959267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy additional pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-21T08:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-20T08:10:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Harriet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.23},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.85},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":50.83,"local_amount":5083.4,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:24Z","rounded_local_amount":5239.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024252}],"funded_date":"2015-09-11T06:01:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul Lavender","image":1304534}},{"id":934629,"name":"Catherine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Catherine is a married woman with 1 child.

This is James. He is the Head teacher of Kirinya Parents School, a mixed school in the Urban area of Kampala with 300 students. Kirinya School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nKirinya School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. James ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":1959510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-08-21T09:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-20T09:20:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kirinya Parents School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3035000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":607000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":607000,"processed_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":620375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755507292}],"funded_date":"2015-08-22T21:13:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":934808,"name":"Sona","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This nice and charming woman\u2019s name is Sona and she lives in the village Verin Khotanan of Syunik region.

years old, single, with a daughter. Bermet is a very responsible and calm woman. She has completed secondary school. Now she sells groceries and cold beverages for a living. Bermet's seed capital when starting this business was 50,000 som (KGS). Her current turnover is 100,000 som (KGS) with the monthly income of 19,000 som (KGS) which is not enough to support herself and her daughter. That's why she turned to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to buy groceries to increase her store's turnover. Bermet plans to further develop her business in the future to improve her family's well-being."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":256.75,"image":{"id":1955891,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She\u2019s a long time member of the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Araneta branch. \r\n\r\nMina is engaged in different types of businesses. One is an internet shop with four computer units. Basically, every unit is like a vending machine where the user will drop a P 1.00 coin for it to operate. This is known as \u201cpiso net\u201d in the Philippines where P 1.00 is equivalent to 5 minutes usage of the computer. She also sells Virgin coconut oil and owns a four-unit apartment that she rents out. She earns P 12,000 from the computer shop, P 7,000 for selling Virgin coconut oil and P 8,000 from the apartment rental each month.\r\n\r\nHer total monthly earnings are just enough to sustain the family's monthly expenses. She\u2019s thinking of strategies on how to earn more profit each month for her to buy necessities for the business.  She wants to buy another computer, more stock of virgin coconut oil, and renovate her apartment. \r\n\r\nHowever, without more capital she will need to wait for years to make those happen. That\u2019s why she has applied for a P 30,000 loan to buy the necessary things. She is hoping that God will touch the hearts of people who will read her story.\r\n\r\nMina believes that if you want success, you need God to be your greatest foundation.

Right now, she is 31 and a very industrious, honest, and hardworking mother from the Nkubu area of Kenya, near the famous Mount Kenya. <br \/><br \/>Mary has been farming for the past 11 years. Over the years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been from selling milk, eggs, crops, and from some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Mary is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plough. <br \/><br \/>Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by buying bananas seeds so that she can plant them and sell them after harvesting. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy seeds of banana. Kenya's Nkubu area, one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for bananas. This means that Mary could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. <br \/><br \/>Accessing funds has been a challenge for Mary, but she now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like herself turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Mary believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for food. <br \/><br \/>She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Mary to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":52.6,"image":{"id":1959623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy seeds and start banana farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-21T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-20T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2477.05},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2549.45},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2623.95},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2700.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2779.57},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2860.8},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2944.4},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.45},{"due_date":"2016-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3119.02},{"due_date":"2016-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3210.17},{"due_date":"2016-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3303.99},{"due_date":"2016-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3400.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.86,"local_amount":2886.27,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2975.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024261},{"amount":23.74,"local_amount":2373.78,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":2446.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112289}],"funded_date":"2015-08-24T22:51:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Courtenay Selden","image":null}},{"id":934911,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy is a married woman with one child who is still too young to attend school.

She will use the loan amount to buy more stocks of clothing. As festival season is knocking at the door, she needs more supply for her clients. She hopes the expansion of her business will earn more revenue to provide her proper economical provisions.  <br \/><br \/>She is thankful to her lenders."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1959606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase more variety of clothing for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Kandi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2015-08-21T16:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-20T16:40:11Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jharna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-09-03T02:16:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":934942,"name":"Mwatime","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwatime is married and has two children,  one of whom attends school while the other is still young for schooling.

Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and maize. Lilian has been relying on agriculture to make all of her income.

Despite these tough conditions, Lilian remains positive and passionate about her economic activity. <br \/><br \/>Lilian is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. This loan will enable her to expand the section of her business least affected by harsh external conditions. Poultry farming is cheaper to run and the demand for chicken products is always high. With this loan, Lilian will be able to increase the sales from her poultry business and make more profits. An increase in income for her is timely, since it will enable her to tackle high farm-related costs next season. This will greatly improve the quality of work since the cost of every input will be adequately met. As a result, she will realize better quality produce and more yields.

This is her alternative business aside from her food stall business that sells cooked viands and snacks. She\u2019s grateful that Center for Community Transformation has partnered with Kiva to help new entrepreneurs on their business. The previous loan that was granted enabled her to buy different silver accessories and added items for her buy and sell business. It resulted to her increased daily sales; and now she wants to thank you, kindhearted lenders, for your donations. She\u2019s praying for a blissful life for people like you with compassionate hearts.<br \/><br \/>Most of Teresita\u2019s customers are her neighbors and friends that\u2019s why she can\u2019t avoid lending products to them. She finds the job challenging since there are customers who give delayed payments and it\u2019s somehow difficult to collect debts each day. She wants to have supplementary capital so she can buy more silver accessories to display and sell. It will surely entice more customers and will eventually bring higher profit for her. To attain this, she applied for a P34, 000 loan that would help her business grow.

Both of her businesses earn her about 48,300 KHR per day to support her family\u2019s needs. The main challenge of the family\u2019s business is that the rice crops have been destroying by pests, which results in low output. <br \/><br \/>This is the second time for her to seek a new loan from VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). With the previous loan that she paid back completely, Leang Sry has managed to improve her family's standard of living. In fact, she has renovated the house to be more comfortable.

Trias, Cavite, Philippines. Single, happy and content, being able to have her own business to support herself and help some of her less privileged relatives. \r\n\r\nDanila has been operating her store for three already. She sells dry and packaged commodities directly to consumers. All products are essential food items. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store means a lot to her since it has been her main source of income.\r\n\r\nTo help her sustain her business, she is requesting a Php 15,000 loan which she will use to fill her store with grocery items such as canned goods, instant noodles, biscuits, soda, condiments, toiletries, etc. She is more than happy that she earns enough to cover her daily sustenance.\r\n\r\nDanila's simple dream is to someday own a mini-grocery store. She prays for God to bless her with abundance in all areas of her life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n * All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":303.34,"image":{"id":1960228,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items to sell at her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"General Trias, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-08-21T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-20T22:20:03Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Danila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":108.35,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:37:46Z","rounded_local_amount":5013.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434443},{"amount":86.68,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4010.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955397},{"amount":108.31,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5013.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045241}],"funded_date":"2015-08-22T02:11:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Veronica Cerrer","image":null}}]}
