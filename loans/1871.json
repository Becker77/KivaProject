Two years ago the workers at a construction company ordered some lunches from her. They were so pleased with them that they promoted her good cooking and thanks to this her clientele increased. She says that the most important thing in these types of small businesses is that they must have something different to offer to their clientele, as many of the people who eat her food come back because of how flavorful her lunches are, in spite of the fact that there are other options in the area. \r\n\r\nFor Eneida the tasks involved in her business are those that allow her to keep herself  constantly busy, and her age must never be a step toward  a passive, limited life. For that reason she is hoping to get her first kiva loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Maria Santo Domingo so that she can buy at wholesale meat, vegetables and the ingredients she needs to increase the number of lunches per day and serve customer demand.

As a result, children are forced to drop out and start working to contribute their earnings to their families. <br \/><br \/>So Cecilia made the decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access its loans that would help her improve her farm and thus her earnings, She has applied for a 10,000 KES loan through Kiva's field partner Juhudi Kilimo to buy seed and expand the size of her farmland. The additional income from her farm will go to paying for her children's education.

Tiwonge has not given up hope of ever going to college. <br \/><br \/>She has gone through an intensive training to start running her own business with Zoona as a Mobile money transfer agent in Mzuzu.<br \/>Tiwonge\u2019s biggest dream is to expand her business beyond her home town. She intends to work extra hard so that she can open more outlets and have more profits. However, Tiwonge faces the challenge of accessing working capital to start running her own business.  <br \/><br \/>She is requesting for a Kiva loan in order to start her own business.

He is asking for a Kiva loan to buy a maize milling machine so that he can provide a milling service to over 600 families in his community. The maize milling machine takes raw maize (corn) and creates a maize flour which is the staple food in Zambia. Most rural families in Chibombo District grow maize on their small farms and store it and use it as their primary supply of food for the year. After the kernels are removed from the cob, they then have to be milled to create flour, which can then be boiled to make what is locally called Nshima. <br \/><br \/>Rent-to-Own has done market research in Fizwell's community and has determined that the location for this equipment is ideal. The closest maize mill is about 7 km away, This means most potential customers have to travel more about 7 km, and since most will walk or use their bicycles to travel to the maize mill, it is certain they will prefer to use this maize mill rather than traveling a longer distance. <br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, the upfront costs of such a maize mill are very prohibitive.

Her jeepney needs to have regular maintenance to ensure safe and efficient service. <br \/><br \/>She is requesting a Php 20000 loan which she will use to buy new tires for her jeepney. She is hoping and is thanking God and you in advance for your positive response to assist her in her livelihood. She is thankful that her earnings from her three businesses helps a lot in sending her children to school and fund their household needs.<br \/><br \/>Mildred hopes to build additional boarding house and grow her businesses so she could save up for her children's College Education. She prays for the safety of her husband and passengers in their everyday trips. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. <br \/><br \/>* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital  and repay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":262.5,"image":{"id":1960297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for her jeepeny's new tires.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"General Trias, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-08-22T15:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-21T15:40:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mildred","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":833.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":8333.3,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:36:23Z","rounded_local_amount":8676.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955399},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.32,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3470.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045243}],"funded_date":"2015-09-21T14:11:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":935388,"name":"Lorna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorna lives at Solana.

Because nowadays, perseverance and determination is not enough, but monetary capability is very important to make the business grow. When her previous loan was granted, it became the start of a big change on her business. Aside from running a variety store, she's now focused on selling personal products like soap, shampoo, make up, perfumes, and others. She attracted additional number of patrons in her new business.\n\nBelinda wants to thank lenders for donating certain amounts that supported her business. She\u2019ll include them in prayer as God will return abundance to those who considered her story. Now, she is requesting for another loan of P20,000 as she needs to add stocks on display of personal products. She aims to have more items to get more customers and bigger sales.\n\nBelinda spares time attending the weekly CCT group fellowship consisting of 10-15 individuals where she can gain spiritual strength and where she can reflect on God's Word and testimonies from other CCT partners. She can also build social relationship with other fellowship members and pay Micro Finance loans during this fellowship meeting."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":420,"image":{"id":1958415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to add stocks on display of personal and home care products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-08-22T15:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-21T15:50:07Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Belinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":6666.65,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:37:47Z","rounded_local_amount":6950.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434445},{"amount":150,"local_amount":6666.65,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:36:23Z","rounded_local_amount":6950.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955400},{"amount":120,"local_amount":5333.32,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:13:45Z","rounded_local_amount":5560.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045244}],"funded_date":"2015-08-22T19:19:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":932838,"name":"Anita","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Anita tiene 35 a\u00f1os de edad, es conviviente, vive con sus hijos y su conyuge quien es jornalero agricola, en una zona rural del distrito de Za\u00f1a que se encuentra ubicado en la provincia de Chiclayo, regi\u00f3n Lambayeque, en la costa norte de Per\u00fa.

Because of the immense knowledge she has about farming, she commands a lot of respect among other farmers, and she is viewed as a mentor in her village. <br \/><br \/>She lives with her family in the Kitale area of Kenya, which is known for maize plantations for export production. Rebeca\u2019s primary income sources are eggs, milk, and some personal business she engages in to supplement her meager income. Generating an income through selling her harvest is the part of farming she enjoys most. She also keeps a dairy cow. <br \/><br \/>Availability of labor is a major challenge for Rebeca. Before joining Juhudi, Rebeca could not access loans from banks since they considered her a high-risk client. She mobilized marginalized farmers and created the group Weyeta traders. Through the group, she joined Juhudi Kilimo and learned about loan management and agribusiness. She also got to learn about Kiva. <br \/><br \/>Rebeca is seeking a loan to purchase farm implements. With your loan, Rebeca will purchase more effective, modern tools that will make her farm activities much easier.

Despite personal challenges, her passion is to support her children and siblings. <br \/><br \/>The living conditions in the Kitale area are very tough, and you need to have a tough skin in order to survive. Merene has always shown the resilience necessary to beat all the odds. Because of the hardcore poverty in her village, Merene started practicing mixed farming 10 years ago. Her sources of income are vegetables, milk, and egg sales. However, these products are highly perishable and require timely delivery to the market. The Kitale area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads, which really hampers timely delivery of products to the market. That is why Merene is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike.

Now, Saluon is applying for a loan, which is her second cycle with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). Based on the past loan which was fully repaid, she has managed it well to provide her children with sufficient foods. As the leader of two member group, she will use her loan to buy organic fertilizer to improve the farmland. She hopes that this loan will help her to expand her business so as to upgrade the living condition."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":91,"image":{"id":1960448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy organic fertilizer to improve the farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Siem Reap Province, Banteay Srey Distrcit","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2015-08-22T16:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-21T16:30:06Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saluon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lean","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":182000},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":182000},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":182000},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":182000},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":182000},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":182000},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":182000},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":182000},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":182000},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":182000},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":180000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.5},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":45.5,"local_amount":182000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:54:41Z","rounded_local_amount":185338.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731194814},{"amount":45.5,"local_amount":182000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":185338.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752282353}],"funded_date":"2015-08-25T15:03:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":935355,"name":"Theary's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Theary\u2019s group live in a rural village in Kampong Speu province in Cambodia.

She is fully dedicated to her farm work and thinks only of progressing. Regina resides in the Nkubu area of Kenya, which is a remote town with harsh living conditions because of the bad terrain in the region. She is happily married and, together with her husband, has a lovely family. Regina\u2019s primary sources of income are milk and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. Regina has managed to take care of her family with her income from selling different varieties of food crops. The Nkubu area has conditions that favor crop farming. <br \/><br \/>Regina has always wanted to start banana farming, but the lack of capital has prevented her. She is seeking a loan to buy seeds and start banana farming. With this loan she will be able to harvest more bananas and, hence, satisfy the ready market in her region. Demand for bananas in the Nkubu area is high, but the supply is low.

Sari-sari is a Filipino word which means \u201cvariety\u201d where customers can select from a wide variety of choices sold at a cheaper price compared to supermarkets and other convenience stores. She also wants to thank lenders who read her story and lent certain amounts to help her buy necessary items for her business.<br \/><br \/>Bebelyn aims to step up every year in her business. In the past six months, she witnessed the growth of her business with God as her greatest provider. This year she wants to expand the business even more by adding additional products and stock so that customers will have a variety of choices. She wants her sari-sari to become a one-stop shop for customers. With this, Bebelyn applied for another loan of 20,000 PHP to buy stock of grocery items, sacks of rice, eggs and school supplies. <br \/><br \/>Bebelyn is consistent in attending a weekly fellowship group for CCT partners.
