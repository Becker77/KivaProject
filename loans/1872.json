Aside from hard work and patience, capital is a crucial aspect for any business to succeed.

Her inspiration are her children whom she needs to support and raise. The competition on this line of business is what she considers a challenge since it also affects her daily income. However she is grateful for Center for Community Transformation (CCT), Kiva and the lenders who are God\u2019s instruments of blessing to new entrepreneurs like her to succeed in the business. Josefina applied for P12,000 loan as supporting capital, so she can buy additional therapy tools for the business.

Because of drought, her crop has not grown well and as a result she doesn't have enough working capital to support her business.  So she decided to apply for a loan with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner).  This is her first time applying for a loan with Kiva. \r\n\r\nChhim and her group member will apply for a loan of 1,200,000 KHR each. As the group leader, she is going to use her loan portion to buy rice seeds and fertilizer to support her farmland and increase the productivity of her crop yield. She hopes to make extra income so that she can buy a motorbike to drive her to work on time.

After managing household work, Madhabi also helps her husband in selling the grocery items. <br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, the income is hardly enough to make ends meet because they have a limited stock in their grocery store. Now the couple needs to increase the stock of supplies at their store, which will help to enhance the earnings. <br \/><br \/>Madhabi feels it is urgent to expand their store with more groceries for good revenue, so she applied for a loan from BJS, partner of Kiva to purchase more inventories like rice, oil, salt, flour, spices and other daily necessities in bulk to expand her business.<br \/><br \/>She is hopeful that she will provide a better education to her children and financial stability in her family with the expansion of her business. The increased income will help her to be confident to achieve her goals. <br \/><br \/>She thanks BJS and Milaap, their benefactor."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1960380,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase more varieties of inventory for her husband\u2019s grocery shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Falakata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2015-08-23T12:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-22T12:50:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Madhabi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":13000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-09-01T16:34:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":932642,"name":"Denia Carolina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La joven  Denia Carolina de 31  a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su esposo e hijos en su casa propia, se dedica desde hace 5  a\u00f1os al negocio de venta de \u00datiles escolares, vende libretas, cuadernos, l\u00e1pices, papel bon, folder, grapadoras, etc. tambi\u00e9n cuenta con su propia fotocopiadora y laminadora  para el servicio de sus clientes.\nDo\u00f1a Denia Carolina vive en una comunidad en la zona sur de Honduras es una mujer emprendedora con deseos de salir adelante y lucha d\u00eda con d\u00eda para mejorar su calidad de vida, est\u00e1 solicitando el pr\u00e9stamo para compra de productos como papel bon, papel oficio, cuadernos de varios tipos y tama\u00f1os, l\u00e1pices, etc. para surtir su negocio con el apoyo de este pr\u00e9stamo pretende mejorar sus ingresos y tambi\u00e9n su calidad de vida, es un cliente subsiguiente   con deseos de trabajar con Prisma.\nSu sue\u00f1o es tener un buen negocio y bien surtido y al mismo  tiempo mejorar su futuro junto a su familia.\n\nSan Lorenzo, Honduras  -  Julio del  2015.\n\n","en":"Young Denia Carolina, 31 years old, lives with her husband and children at a house of her own.

In this business, an entrepreneur becomes a reseller of a company. The company provides the necessary brochure that shows various products like ready-to-wear clothes for men & women, foot wears, make ups, appliances and items for personal use. A signed up registration form and minimal membership fee qualify an individual to become a reseller. Most mothers who are busy with their families are engaged in this type of business since most of their customers are just their neighbors and friends. Basically its viability depends on the reseller's talent to persuade the customers.\n\nIn every business, patience and perseverance are major key to success. Like Grydia, one of the partners of Center for Community Transformation (CCT), she doesn't have high capital for the business but she has passion and dedication to be successful. That\u2019s why Grydia is thankful that CCT granted the loan that she applied previously. She also wants to thank Kiva and lenders for helping her on the business by considering her story and by donating certain amounts. \n\nThis year, Grydia wants to apply for another loan of P13,000 to have additional products on display. Availability of the products is an important thing to consider, so customers will not wait for weeks just to have the product.

She believes that it\u2019s a normal thing to have a chicken and dairy farm in Kenya, but to start a pig farm is something else entirely. Sylviah is a smallhold mixed-farmer based in Itugururu village in Chuka. She has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. To earn a decent living, she makes income selling milk, poultry, and greens and engaging in numerous small personal businesses. Only recently, she started seeing how she could be making big money by pig farming. Raising pigs to Sylviah is something close to a hobby. She wants to sell pig meat but figures that she needs more pigs so as to make economic sense. She needs to purchase more pigs. However, her biggest challenge today is limited funds to expand. Sylviah is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase pigs. Future proceeds from the commercialization of her pig farm are already committed to pay for her siblings' education.
