Atta has decided to use 60% of the profit to cater for the children education and plow-back the remaining 40%. Atta thanks all his micro lenders for their kind support."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1875736,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy agro chemicals, spraying machines, wellington boots and cutlasses for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Assin Fosu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":392,"posted_date":"2015-08-23T22:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-22T22:40:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Atta","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":933406,"name":"Delfina","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"A senhora Delfina \u00e9 casada, vive com o esposo,  tr\u00eas filhos. \u00c9 Docente, com o presente  empr\u00e9stimo pretende comprar material de constru\u00e7\u00e3o, cimento, arreia, pedra, barrotes, loi\u00e7a de casa de banho e ferros.

She is a wife, the mother of two children, and a grandmother. She has been working as a social worker in a primary school for nine years. She and her husband have fought to provide for their family in an honest and humble manner, as like in every home, difficult situations have always arisen, and this has been a unifying factor for the family.<br \/><br \/>Do\u00f1a Ana decided to continue supporting her youngest son, age 20, in his university studies, as her biggest dream is to see her family prepared and competing in the job market,  doing what they love the most.  Her son Cesar earned a degree in Computer Technology, graduating with 90%  average, and currently, he is beginning his university studies in the culinary\/food and beverages field.  That is why his mother is giving him economic support so that he may complete his studies without any problems.<br \/><br \/>Cesar comments that every sacrifice his mother makes means a lot to him, as she is an older person, and she has worked all her life in order to give the best to her family. That is why he has found temporary employment as an administrative assistant in a high school in the capital.  He says that his income is not sufficient to cover his tuition, but it absolutely helps, along with the income that his mother has set aside in order to be able to support him with his educational loan. <br \/><br \/>Cesar tells us a little about all the qualities that make him exceptional, unique, and irreplaceable:  he has always been honest in every situation; he is patient in the face of adversity; he is faithful to his friends, to his family, and first and foremost, to God.  He is sympathetic and kind, he has a gift for serving and solidarity, and he is punctual. He likes to spend time with other people and he prefers teamwork. <br \/><br \/>Being able to undertake something new each day is a great motivation for Cesar, as his degree will enable him to be a professional chef.  And, he is sure that this will help him to improve his family's quality of life.<br \/><br \/>He wants to contribute to his country by creating a company capable of generating many employment opportunities for young people like himself, and for people who fight to achieve their goals.<br \/><br \/>Cesar recalls his uncertainty and lack of direction in choosing a vocation to study, but his decision was made the moment he realized how many people are suffering from hunger in the street every day, and that there are many children who have been abandoned by their parents and have nothing to eat. That is why his love for culinary art grew, and now he is very happy with what he has decided to study.<br \/><br \/>Cesar wants to graduate, learn other languages, work, and be able to establish his own business.  First and foremost, God will always be the center of his achievements, and he wants to dedicate his profession, and convert it into a means of supporting poor boys and girls."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1954155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Mukta also assists her husband in this agribusiness; they earn an average income by which Mukta maintains her four-member family. This income is barely sufficient to manage all the expenses of her family, so she and her husband decided to cultivate \u201cber,\u201d a soft and juicy fruit that is very popular to the regional people of West Bengal. In West Bengal it is called \u2018kul.\u2019 The beginning of monsoon is the best time for planting Bers. Mukta has chosen this because the climate and soil is suitable for ber cultivation. So Mukta seeks a loan from BJS (a Kiva partner) to purchase farm inputs for ber cultivation. <br \/><br \/>She hopes that this loan will help her to earn more profit and ensure financial stability in her family. In the future she dreams of constructing a concrete house for her family with the generated profit.<br \/><br \/>Mukta thanks her generous lenders."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1960879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase farm inputs for ber cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Falakata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2015-08-24T04:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-23T04:20:06Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mukta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":10000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-08-26T22:42:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Henderson","image":1126934}},{"id":933539,"name":"Kelvi Joel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Kelvi  tiene  22 a\u00f1os de edad,  conviviente, tiene dos hijos,  en el distrito de Cayalti que se encuentra ubicado en la provincia de Chiclayo, regi\u00f3n Lambayeque, en la costa norte de Per\u00fa.

They are women from the same community who organized themselves to earn financing. This made them able to strengthen their productive activities, as the majority have a primary school or lower education. <br \/><br \/>They work in families because this is where subsistence activities occur, but the women are able to come together and move forward. This is the main income for their households. All have children studying in primary or secondary school. They have always been known for their good behavior with repayment in their earlier loans. This is the fourth loan they've taken out to strengthen their businesses. <br \/><br \/>Rosibel is a young woman who's 31. She's the mother of three children and the head of the house. Currently, two of her children are in school and she attends university, with the goal of improving herself and giving her family a better quality of live. She's studying for a career in preschool education. She relies on help from her parents to care for her children and her father's help to care for her livestock, due to the fact that they live on his farm. <br \/><br \/>She will invest this new loan in buying heifers to fatten and later sell at auction, which is her buyer. She has experience in various activities that earn money for her to be able to study and thus achieve her goals. This is the only way to get ahead because sources of work are scarce in this community. <br \/><br \/>Together with Rosibel are three other women who will invest their loans in buying livestock, banana farming and a groceries.

For this, he believes taking a loan from Kiva's field partner, Al Majmoua, is the best solution to pay for his son's wedding expenses.\r\n\r\nJihad is also working hard to buy a wider bus so that he can provide his transportation services to an increased number of passengers."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1960715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wedding Expenses","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to pay for his son's wedding expenses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Saida","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.563056 35.368889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2015-08-24T11:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-23T11:00:02Z","loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Refugee"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jihad ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":178},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2017-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2017-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":166}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul Lavender","image":1304534}},{"id":935035,"name":"Blanca Libia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Blanca es una luchadora, toda una guerrera, una veterana de mil batallas, a sus 68 a\u00f1os de edad siempre tuvo que protegerse y pelear por ganarse su sustento, ella es soltera y no tiene hijos, con su esfuerzo y sudor monto un negocio de cr\u00eda de ganado bovino.\n\nSu humilde prop\u00f3sito a su edad es mantener su actividad en pie, poder gozar de una vejez tranquila y su sue\u00f1o es tener salud que le permita levantarse todos los d\u00edas a realizar su profesi\u00f3n. \n\nBlanca quiere solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de lechones y una vaca lechera para aumentar su producci\u00f3n y as\u00ed contrarrestar la problem\u00e1tica del bajo precio de venta de leche.\n","en":"68-year-old Blanca is a fighter, a real warrior and a veteran with countless battles behind her.

This will see him increase his household income considerably. <br \/><br \/>Thanks to Babban Gona's support, Bawa now has the opportunity to increase his yields and income and use his additional earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1961865,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase improved farm inputs that will increase his farm's yields.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-08-24T18:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-23T18:30:04Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bawa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":27310.5,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":27310.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-08-24T21:03:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Fitzgerald","image":null}},{"id":935407,"name":"Rizqinisso","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0420\u0438\u0437\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0441\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0434 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441. \u0420\u0438\u0437\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0441\u043e \u0447\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0448\u0432\u0435\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0448\u044c\u0435\u0442 \"\u043a\u0443\u0440\u043f\u0430\" \u0438 \"\u043a\u0443\u0440\u043f\u0430\u0447\u0430\". \n\"\u041a\u0443\u0440\u043f\u0430\" \u0438 \"\u043a\u0443\u0440\u043f\u0430\u0447\u0430\"- \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0441\u044b. \"\u041a\u0443\u0440\u043f\u0430\" \u0448\u044c\u044e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043d\u043e \u043a\u0432\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435, \u0435\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u044e\u0442 \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0435\u044f\u043b\u0430. \u041a\u0443\u0440\u043f\u0430\u0447\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u0438\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0441\u044b \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0434\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u044b. \u0420\u0438\u0437\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0441\u043e \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e 5 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0438\u0437\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \"\u043a\u0443\u0440\u043f\u0430\" \u0438 \"\u043a\u0443\u0440\u043f\u0430\u0447\u0430\". \u041d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e.  \u0420\u0438\u0437\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0441\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0442\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u0448\u0432\u0435\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0434\u043b\u0435\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430.
