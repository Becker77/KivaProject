Her parents try their level best to make their children well-educated. <br \/><br \/>Chinta has decided to provide good tutors for her daughter and that will be possible only if she can get financial assistance. That is why she applied for a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to purchase Lila\u2019s educational equipment and pay all the educational fees of her daughter. She hopes that this loan amount will provide a good support to continue her daughter\u2019s education further and fulfill her daughter\u2019s dream.<br \/><br \/>Chinta and Lila (as seen in the picture) thank their generous lenders."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1961449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher

Lush green landscapes with palms are a part of the beauty of the city that is located in the mountains above the coast. Here there is a great quantity and variety of fruit. The people speak Kaqchikel Maya. <br \/><br \/>Patulul is the home of The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank's 'Las Conchitas Group,' with its seven very hard-working and industrious members who have small commercial businesses.  All the members have a variety of small businesses. They sell orange juice, chicken and beef, fried potatoes and chicken, as well as shops that sell sundries, tortillas, groceries, and wool.  They have seen their earnings grow, which encourages them to stay in business and watch them grow. <br \/><br \/>Olga is a good example of the Las Conchitas Group members. She is a housewife, mother, and small business businesswoman. Daily, she is up early, making orange juice to sell in her convenience store. <br \/><br \/>Olga is asking for a loan, so she can invest in inventory for her store, such as: sugar, eggs, soup, rice, detergent, and many sacks of oranges, in order to grow her business. That way, she can keep offering a better life for her children. <br \/><br \/>The women average five children each and, with homes to maintain, they are motivated to improve their businesses, in order to provide opportunities for their children to attend school through a secondary education. This is the reason for their asking Friendship Bridge for microloans, so that they can continue to grow their businesses, in order to become successful businesswomen who can experience the joys of a better life for themselves and their children.  <br \/><br \/>The women of Las Conchitas Group feel satisfied with their successes and are grateful for the support given them by Kiva investors. This support also includes the monthly meetings where the facilitator provides educational topics as a part of the Friendship Bridge 'Microcredit Plus' program that combines microloans and education. These topics include business management, accounting, sound investments, savings, and customer service, among many others.

Slowly, they are being relieved of huge educational expenses because two of their five children have already finished their schooling, while the other two are still studying in college and the youngest is in high school. <br \/><br \/>Now Haydee is giving extra attention to her business. She realized that she cannot get enough clients while waiting inside the store. Therefore, she concentrates on marketing and networking to get volume orders from schools, offices and workplaces.

He has basic grains and coffee growing on this property. His produce is destined for their own consumption and for sale when he has the opportunity.

Her biggest challenge is the lack of finances to improve her farming and prevent diseases. She is seeking a loan of KES 20,000 to purchase a goat. By the end of the year, the goat will have given birth to at least four other goats. Through goat keeping, she will be able to get goat skin, which is very expensive and fetches more profits.

She has a specialized secondary education and good references from her neighbors. They think she is a responsible and honest woman. To provide the primary income for her family, Nargiza has been involved in animal husbandry and farming since 2011. She has 2 cows on her farm. Additionally, Nargiza has 1.78 hectares of land, where she grows watermelons and corn.

Today, this humble mother of four children sells milk, eggs, and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has about farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart, and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. <br \/><br \/>Although she makes a profit through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit so she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. Through the loan she will have an easier time milking her cow and also feeding it. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and also prevent them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. <br \/><br \/>Agnes believes that through this loan her living conditions will change because she is going to have an increase in milk production. She will save money that she used to spend on treating her cows because she lacked a good dairy unit. Agnes waits for your kindness.

Meet Damaris, one of the most hardworking and dedicated women on planet earth. She is based in Maili kumi, a remote village in the Nkubu area of Kenya. She is happily married. She is blessed with two lovely children. For the past 10 years she has been engaging in mixed farming and through selling milk and a variety of food crops she has earned a decent income. Like many farmers in her village, she also plants trees on her farm to complement the region's natural forests. <br \/><br \/>Although Damaris makes profits selling her farm produce at the market, the biggest challenge she faces is the lack of water to irrigate her farm and water for home consumption. Damaris comes from an area where there is no water connection and she is always forced to walk for a long distance for this \u201cprecious commodity.\u201d Because of her age, she faces challenges carrying water on her back. <br \/><br \/>Damaris is seeking a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes. Most of the farmers in Kenya depend on rain fed agriculture but Damaris wants to change that notion and start irrigation farming. Through the loan she intends to harvest rain water which always goes to waste and store it in the tanks. She intends to buy pipes that will be used to pump water from the river directly to her farm. With your loan Damaris will be saved the trouble of walking a long distance in search of water and she will have enough water for home consumption. <br \/><br \/>Irrigating her farm will boast productivity since water is an important requirement in the germination of crops. Damaris is very excited about this project and hopes her dream will be achieved through the loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders. Increased productivity means increased income and this will translate to improved living standards. She will use the additional income to improve and secure the future of her children. Damaris\u2019s hope for the future is to live a fulfilling life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":47.23,"image":{"id":1960658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a water tank to store rain water,  water pipes and a pump.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-08-25T09:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-24T09:00:01Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Damaris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.23},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.85},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":24.74,"local_amount":2473.95,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2555.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024272},{"amount":22.49,"local_amount":2249.18,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2323.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112305}],"funded_date":"2015-08-25T14:44:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Grantham","image":456803}},{"id":935615,"name":"Beatrice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrice is a hardworking 44 year old woman from Nkubu area of Kenya.

With the previous loan, Lilian bought a large water storage basin with two sinks since she didn't have a place to store water for her daily use."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":47.48,"image":{"id":1958601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase galvanized metal sheeting, wood, nails and wire to repair the kitchen and the walls of her house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2015-08-25T13:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-24T13:10:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilian Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":15.04},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":16.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":16.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":17.78},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":18.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":19.13},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":19.84},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":20.37},{"due_date":"2016-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":21.32},{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":21.96},{"due_date":"2016-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":23.67},{"due_date":"2016-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":24.58},{"due_date":"2016-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":26.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.04},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.62},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.55},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.85},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.78},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.19},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.13},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.84},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.37},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.32},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.96},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.67},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.58},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":16.52,"local_amount":16.52,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T12:44:52Z","rounded_local_amount":16.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711400158},{"amount":15.68,"local_amount":15.68,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:40:42Z","rounded_local_amount":15.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730921350},{"amount":15.28,"local_amount":15.28,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:40:54Z","rounded_local_amount":15.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752012070}],"funded_date":"2015-08-26T06:33:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Wendy Harris","image":null}},{"id":936341,"name":"Yura","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This man with his wife lives in the village Chakaten of Syunik region and he hurries to be thankful for his first Kiva loan.

The local journalists named the region \"the bride of the sun\" being that to perish the heat and the earth seem to have an affair.\r\n\r\nIn one of the colonies of this town a group called Chicharrines joined because one of the members who sells the traditional snacks known as \"chicharrones\" joined. The current members of the group are: Adolfina who sells groceries; Virginia, food and spa services; Petra, soft drinks; Dominga, soft drinks, food, stationary and the internet; Jos\u00e9.

When he left his studies he began working as a delivery boy in a snack business, however the desire to have his own business led him to give up and invest his savings in the sale of chicharrones. He makes the snacks himself, inside of a large pan with oil poured on the pasta and gradually he acquires a crunchy consistency; after he makes the packets with the fries that they share between the shops in his community.\r\n\r\nThe success that he has had for just eight months has allowed him to plan to expand sales routes, and in the same way increase his production and achieve making his business a startup. Although there is competition, he is not worried since his quality and price support it, or as his slogan says \"chicharrones with the flavor of home\".\r\n\r\nThe earnings are engaged in the purchase of pasta, oil, pepper, gum, peanuts, bags, labels and other sweets, also it covers the salary of his employees and the fuel for their cars. The current loan will be invest in the purchase of pasta, oil, bags and labels. \"I am deeply grateful to God and to those who have made it possible to make my dreams come true\" says Jos\u00e9 A.\r\n\r\n*The photograph shows the members of the group.

She sells her produce to the local market and vendors at her town.<br \/><br \/>To help her sustain and grow her business, she is seeking your assistance of a 15,000 PHP loan to pay for fertilizer, seedlings and labor for her farm. Her farm means a lot to her for it is her main source to provide for their daily needs.<br \/><br \/>Erlinda only dreams to always have a productive harvest on her farm. She trusts that God will continue to bless her with abundance in all aspects of her life. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/> * All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":176.06,"image":{"id":1962507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to pay for fertilizers, seedlings, and labor for her farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-08-25T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-24T14:00:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erlinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":54.2,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T13:37:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2528.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711434462},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:36:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2528.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955419},{"amount":67.7,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3160.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045263}],"funded_date":"2015-08-25T17:22:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":936897,"name":"Cecilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of four children, Cecilia works hard to support her family.<br \/><br \/>She has a making of dried fish business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from selling vegetables.

He runs a stucco-making business. He is steadfast, strong and a fighter. He runs his business in the village of Vichaya, which is situated south-west of the city whose region still has important 'Puqaras' (Inca military constructions). The region's climate is cold and dry and daytime temperatures fluctuate between 0-8 degrees centigrade. Manuel has dark skin and short hair and is slim. His mother tongue is Aymara, which he speaks at home; he speaks Spanish for business purposes. His wife works with him in the business and they live in their own room, which is made from adobe and has a corrugated iron roof, a stone floor and electricity. However, it does not have a water supply or a sewerage system. Manuel makes stucco, \"I learned my trade from my dad as he, too, is a stucco producer...\" he says. The advantage of this line of business is that he works with his wife. The disadvantage is the fact that he has no means of transporting the stucco. His dream is to expand his business; he wants to buy a belt for his stucco mill. This is his first loan cycle with the institution in the two years he has been running his business.
