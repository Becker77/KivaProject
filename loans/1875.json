the mother of many children, with 4 sons. Anara has a specialist secondary education. She is responsible, honest, and hard-working. Anara has been practicing field and animal husbandry as the main source of income for her family for the last 20 years. Thanks to Anara's very hard work, her farm now has 5 cows and 38 sheep. She has all that is required for keeping animals: in winter the livestock are kept in barns, and in summer they are sent out to pasture to fatten up.<br \/><br \/>In addition, Anara practices field husbandry on a plot of land measuring 1.04 hectares. The cycle of growing organic fruits and vegetables is like this: first Anara grows seedlings in a greenhouse, then transplants them into the field. However, this year the unexpected happened -- snow fell in March, destroying the greenhouse, and half of the seedlings died (they simply froze). Anara planted the rest of the cabbage, melon, and tomato seedlings on 1.0 hectares of land, but worms attacked the harvest in summer, and the entire already-nearly-ripe harvest was affected. <br \/><br \/>Anara, knowing she could receive a discounted \"Force Majeure\" loan from Bai Tushum Bank CJSC, decided to apply for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) for the recovery of her harvest, buying chemical pesticides to work the soil. Anara plans to use the proceeds from the recovery of her business to continue developing her business, and to plant onions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1961434,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to restore her business by purchasing pesticide to save her land and harvest from worms.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Nooken district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-08-25T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-24T21:00:03Z","loan_amount":2450,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2016-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2016-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":816.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-09-19T06:01:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Dermer","image":1862598}},{"id":936013,"name":"Maria Armandina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda tiene 59 a\u00f1os, es viuda, vive con 1 hijo independiente, en casa propia en sector denominado Santa Sofia, la comunidad donde vive es una comunidad dedicada al comercio, agricultura y ganaderia; y est\u00e1 ubicada en el distrito de Cayalt\u00ed, provincia de Chiclayo, regi\u00f3n Lambayeque, costa norte de Per\u00fa.\n<p>\nMar\u00eda se dedica a crianza y venta de chivos, carneros, patos y pollos, cuenta con muy buenas referencias personales y laborales, su es familia unida.

Sari-sari (a Filipino term for variety) stores sell different products like biscuits, candies, canned goods, noodles, toiletries and many other items that are needed in an individual\u2019s daily life. The proliferation of this business makes the competition stiff. Store owners try many techniques to make it stable and competitive. <br \/><br \/>Edna, 57,  from Barotac Viejo, Iloilo tries combining her variety store with direct selling of Natasha, MSE and Personal Collection products such as lotions, perfumes, powders, ready-to-wears, shoes and bags. Somehow her income provides for their daily expenditures. She is married to Roberto, a 60-year-old government employee. They have grown up children but they still strive to support their grandson. <br \/><br \/>She wants to improve her store by obtaining more supplies of grocery items and beverages. She will also buy additional personal and home care products for her direct selling business. She is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan for this purpose.

Thus, she is asking for a loan to buy meat and sari-sari items such as canned goods, noodles, spices, eggs, cooking oil, coffee, sugar, powdered milk, candies, chips, biscuits, and toiletries. She also wants to purchase three piglets.

This is true for Recho, 53, who is based in the Siongiroi area of Kenya and is a loving mother. <br \/><br \/>She has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years, and she has managed to earn a decent income. Her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops, and some personal businesses she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, she stated, \u201cfeeding my cows.\u201d Her hobby is milking her cow. She sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot meet the demand. <br \/><br \/>For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow; it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will produce between 8 and 12 litres of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profit and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used in repaying the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. <br \/><br \/>Recho is very ambitious. In the near future, she intends to start adding value to her milk business by packaging the milk before selling, and she also plans to start selling dairy products. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future.

Esta es la 7 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 3 a\u00f1os que viene realizando esta actividad.\nEs por esas razones que Karin solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de variedades de harina por quintal.\n","en":"The community bank continues working to improve their businesses. The previous loan benefited all the members to a large extent, as they were able to buy merchandise, make offers, produce larger quantities of bread etc. Their repayments were punctual because they did not have any trouble in their businesses. On this occasion the community bank is led by Karin; a 39-year-old woman who lives with her partner. She has 4 children aged 12, 19, 20, and 9 months. She earns her living through selling bread and \"salte\u00f1as\" (traditional meat pies). Her business is located in the 15 de Agosto neighbourhood which is in the south of the city and is known for its extreme poverty.<br \/><br \/>Francisca has a dark complexion, long, black hair and a robust physique. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed and she speaks Spanish. (She is the one sitting on the right with the green sweater and holding a baby). She shares her life with her partner and their children who go to school. They live in their own home made of bricks and cement, with a corrugated iron roof and earthen floor. It has drinking water, electricity and sewage disposal. <br \/><br \/>Her business is baking bread and selling salte\u00f1as; in the morning she bakes the salte\u00f1as as they are usually eaten mid-morning, and in the afternoon she bakes bread for tea time. \"I bake twice a day, and I sell on foot until everything baked is finished...\" she says. The advantage of her business is that she makes daily sales, the disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy flour by the quintal (hundredweight), and other ingredients such as oil, milk, eggs etc. <br \/><br \/>Her dream is to consolidate her business, she hopes to buy various flours by the quintal. This is the 7th sequence of loans with this institution in 3 years that helps with this. It is for these reasons that Karin is asking for a loan to buy various flours by the quintal."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1868.04,"image":{"id":1962243,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy different flours by the quintal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-08-26T13:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-25T13:20:04Z","loan_amount":5450,"lender_count":149,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariselvy          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karen            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-22T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":37500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":5450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-18T04:00:00Z","amount":4164.16},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T04:00:00Z","amount":4267},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T04:00:00Z","amount":4422.31},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":4583.29},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T04:00:00Z","amount":4750.12},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T04:00:00Z","amount":4923.02},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T04:00:00Z","amount":5102.22},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T04:00:00Z","amount":5287.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":605.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":620.14},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":642.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.1},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":690.35},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":715.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":741.52},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":768.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1225.33,"local_amount":8431.16,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:18:06Z","rounded_local_amount":8442.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732296994},{"amount":642.71,"local_amount":4422.31,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:07:30Z","rounded_local_amount":4428.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752077126}],"funded_date":"2015-09-24T15:00:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Donna Davison","image":null}},{"id":937302,"name":"Jennefer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jennefer is 29 years old, married, and has two children who attend school.

Alagammal belongs to Kulithalai, in rural Tamil Nadu. She is a 40-year-old lady who works as a daily wage labourer in the agricultural sector. She has five members in her family, including three children. Her monthly savings are only INR 1,150, and the monthly medical expense is around INR 800. She has no toilet at home or in the immediate vicinity. <br \/><br \/>Alagammal\u2019s family is one of the millions affected by rural India's sanitation crisis. Without access to a toilet, her family has to walk long distances to relieve themselves in the false privacy of dense bushes or isolated fields. These unsanitary practices make them vulnerable to infections, and the lack of privacy exposes them to molestation or worse. <br \/><br \/>Joining hands with Mahalakshmi and Rajeshwari, whose families face similar problems due to a lack of sanitation facilities, she has formed a group of three members and is hoping to address this issue. Access to a toilet will mean privacy and peace of mind for Alagammal, Mhalakshmi, and Rajeshwari and their families. It will also mean that they no longer need to walk long distances, especially when they are sick. So, together, they seek a loan of INR 42,000 to build a toilet at home. <br \/><br \/>As they begin to enjoy the benefits of basic sanitation and their families improve in health, they will be able to save on medical expenses. Your loan will provide all three families access with improved hygiene and a better way of life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":72.23,"image":{"id":1963234,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to construct a toilet in her home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Kulithalai","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":428,"posted_date":"2015-08-26T15:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-25T15:00:04Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahalakshmi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alagammal","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rajeshwari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":42000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2016-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2017-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.33},{"due_date":"2017-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2333.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.11},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":36.12,"local_amount":2333.33,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:17:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2401.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731047132},{"amount":36.11,"local_amount":2333.33,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:17:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2401.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752135909}],"funded_date":"2015-08-31T06:23:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":937380,"name":"Perfecta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Perfecta is a married woman with seven children.

Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":124.98,"image":{"id":1963236,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds and fertilizers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"Boharatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2015-08-26T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-25T15:20:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4166},{"due_date":"2015-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4166},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4166},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4166},{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4166},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4166},{"due_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4166},{"due_date":"2016-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4166},{"due_date":"2016-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4166},{"due_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4166},{"due_date":"2016-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4166},{"due_date":"2016-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4174}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":4166,"processed_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-09-17T18:15:45Z","rounded_local_amount":4291.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":711654361},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":4166,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4291.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731158928},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":4166,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:04:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4291.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752246641}],"funded_date":"2015-08-26T16:29:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":937374,"name":"Ranjana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ranjana is 30 years old.
