","en":"Erika is a young Ecuadorian woman of 20 years. She lives in the Eloy Alfaro parish in an urban neighbourhood in the sector belonging to the Cotopaxi Province. She is married and has a small daughter, six months old. Thanks to the effort of her parents she managed to finish secondary school, but later ended her studies because of a new challenge in her life: caring for her daughter. So she began working from a very young age to be able to support her needs and those of the new life now accompanying her. <br \/><br \/>It was not at all easy for Erika to learn her trade as the work she does is very hard, involving the production of building blocks. Her husband helps her with this work. She has suffered much but nonetheless is fighting to give the best to her daughter and be a support to her husband. Erika is very happy now because God and life have given her the chance to see her little daughter grow up.<br \/><br \/>Erika is currently living with her relatives, where she has been for several years. Despite having a job that demands a great deal of time and effort, she also spends a lot of time caring for her young daughter. She is a very hardworking and enterprising woman. Today she is requesting a loan which she will use for the purchase of material (powder, chasqui [an Ecuadorian raw material for brick-making] and cement). This will allow her to improve her lifestyle and that of her child, and give her child the upbringing she deserves. Erika thanks Kiva for making the growth of her professional and personal life possible."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":177.23,"image":{"id":1962277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cement","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"buy material such as powder and cement, allowing her to improve her lifestyle and that of her child, and give her child the upbringing she deserves.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2015-08-26T19:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-25T19:10:04Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erika Yessenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1572.57,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83.04},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":93.29},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":92.35},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":98.85},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":98.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":99.6},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":104.51},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":104.65},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":106.32},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":110.04},{"due_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":111.82},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":113.46},{"due_date":"2016-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":116.42},{"due_date":"2016-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":118.79},{"due_date":"2016-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":121.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.44},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.49},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.43},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.75},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.81},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.49},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.21},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.99},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.64},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.6},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.97},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":83.48,"local_amount":83.35,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:21:26Z","rounded_local_amount":83.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730992399},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":93.61,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:19:29Z","rounded_local_amount":93.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752080703}],"funded_date":"2015-08-30T21:45:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Charlotte Doane","image":1930601}},{"id":937446,"name":"Shamshad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shamshad is 42 years old woman living in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, with her one son and five daughters, Her children are in school.

Ellos son: Ver\u00f3nica y Carmen quienes venden calzado por cat\u00e1logo; Yolanda, tamales; Danaides, tacos; Eliazar, pollo y Lorenzo quien da servicio de herrer\u00eda. \n   Don Lorenzo es un hombre trabajador y comprometido con su familia integrada por su esposa Rosaura y 3 hijos los cuales son mayores de edad actualmente. Lencho, como le conocen sus amigos, dedic\u00f3 gran parte de su vida a trabajar en la siembra de ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar, frijol y ma\u00edz, tambi\u00e9n a la pesca y venta de pez mojarra todo esto con el objetivo de solventar los gastos para la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos.\n   No obstante, desde hace 7 a\u00f1os comenz\u00f3 a brindar servicios de herrer\u00eda; oficio que aprendi\u00f3 de un amigo con el cual se asoci\u00f3. Gradualmente pudo comprar una m\u00e1quina para soldar, pinzas, desarmadores, cortadora, segueta y soldadura con lo que dio inicio a su propio taller. En una libreta bosqueja las medidas, el material requerido y la fecha de entrega para poder cumplir en tiempo y forma  a cada uno de sus clientes. Uno de sus hijos est\u00e1 interesado en la actividad as\u00ed pues le ayuda a medir, cortar y pintar las estructuras que previamente su padre dise\u00f1\u00f3. \n   En esta ocasi\u00f3n solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar soldadura, una careta y 3 \u00e1ngulos  indispensables para crear una repisa. \u201cMe gusta mi actividad pues genero ingresos para solventar los gastos de mi familia y adem\u00e1s paso tiempo con ellos\u201d comenta con una gran sonrisa. \n   El grupo agradece a VF M\u00e9xico y KIVA por la gran oportunidad que les brinda para poder cambiar su vida de manera favorable.\n*Ellos son los integrantes del grupo Las Hormigas, Don Lencho es quien viste playera color verde.\n\n","en":"The state of Oaxaca has important communities with historical significance. The tourist destinations that it offers are various and from an outstanding cultural richness from the pre-Hispanic roots that merged with those from the new world. The life of said communities continues being traditional and some still maintain the language of their ancestors. <br \/><br \/>\"Las Hormigas (The Ants)\" group is from the region previously mentioned and they have this name because, just like the small insects, all of the members work in a team to reach their goals. They are: Ver\u00f3nica and Carmen, who sell shoes from a catalog; Yolanda, who sells tamales; Danaides, who sells tacos; Eliazar, who sells chicken; and Lorenzo, who serves as a blacksmith. <br \/><br \/>Lorenzo is a hard-working and dedicated man to his family, composed of his wife, Rosaura, and 3 children who are now adults. Lencho, as his friends call him, dedicated a large part of his life to planting sugar cane, beans, and corn, as well as fishing and selling crappie fish. He did all of this in order to cover his children's educational expenses. <br \/><br \/>However, 7 years ago he started to give his services as a blacksmith. He learned this job from a friend with whom he is associated. Gradually, he was able to buy a soldering machine, pliers, screwdrivers, a cutter blade, hacksaw and solder, and he started his own repair shop. The measurements, necessary materials and the delivery date are outlined in a book to be able to comply with each one of his customers in a timely manner. One of the sons is interested in the job, so he helps him to measure, cut and paint the structures that his father previously designed. <br \/><br \/>This time, he is asking for a loan to buy solder, a mask and 3 indispensable angles to make a shelf. \"I like my job because I get an income to cover my family's expenses and I can spend time with them,\" he says with a big smile. <br \/><br \/>The group thanks VF M\u00e9xico and KIVA for the great opportunity that they are giving them to be able to favorably change their lives. <br \/><br \/>*These are the members of the Las Hormigas group.

For Cristi, as her neighbors know her, caring for the store is a challenge and a lovely memory of her aunt for whom day by day she gives her best self in order to increase her success. <br \/><br \/>The store is located in front of her house in a large room where she places the merchandise on metal shelves so that in this way her customers can easily see the products. The earnings she gets have permitted her to maintain a wide variety of merchandise in addition to the possibility of working with her mother to make bread. Currently they sell 2000 to 2500 bread items per week, which shows the growth that she has managed thanks to its quality and their good treatment. So, Cris makes bread in the morning and in the afternoon she takes care of her grocery business. When she is not there, he son takes over the store.<br \/><br \/>The loan that she requests will be invested in the purchase of sugar, rice, beans, oil, eggs, cheese and detergents to maintain the variety in her shop. \"Thanks to Visi\u00f3nF M\u00e9xico for trusting in us and granting us a loan to continue with our work,\" are the words of Cris who shows great enthusiasm each time she gets the support. <br \/><br \/>*In the photo, Cris is the one who wears a melon-colored blouse and blue pants, Emiliana, who is wearing a yellow blouse, is next to her."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2701.56,"image":{"id":1956241,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

Another lady has a convenience store.\n\nBrenda is a 30 year old member of the group who is married with three children who are 3, 5, and 10 years of age. They are her inspiration and motivation to excel. Brenda has a cosmetic business and sells items by catalogue as well. She is requesting a loan to purchase cosmetic items and other supplies. Brenda wants to have plenty of inventory available for her clientele.\nThe women of the Trust Bank comment that their expectation is to expand their small businesses, increase their earnings and send their children to school. Thanks to KIVA investors and the \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program of Friendship Bridge, that combines small loans and education, they are on their way to achieving these goals.  \n\nThank you, KIVA investors, for your interest in Brenda and her friends in the Trust Bank.

They live in a rural area of Kampong Speu province.  Rice farming on a one-hectare farmland has been the only main source of her family\u2019s income for forty-three years.
