Together with her husband, she has been involved in cassava farming for five years. The main obstacle for her this season is a lack of working capital to support the cassava farming business. \r\n\r\nFor the fist time, Lai is requesting a loan from VisionFund. In a group comprised of three members, Lai is the group leader and will use her loan to purchase organic fertilizer and to pay for the plowing fees for her cassava farming business.

This investment is very significant for his business, since it boosts sales, allows him to reinvest in capital, and offers new merchandise. <br \/><br \/>Donaldo has eleven years in this business, which has permitted him to offer his spouse and his children a better quality of life.

He has a great appreciation for indigenous people\u2019s creativity and he strives to promote it by using their intricately woven or printed cloth as raw materials for his products. He distributes the finished bags to stores that sell native products. Sometimes he accepts bulk orders from companies that use his products as gifts to employees and guests. It\u2019s really attractive to foreign and local tourists who usually visit their area.<br \/><br \/>Levi has hired three employees to help him, from the purchasing of raw materials to sewing, designing and marketing. His wife, Cecilia, is also a skilled sewer who lovingly assists him at all times. Despite some problems like delayed collection of payments, they persist because it\u2019s their source of livelihood. Their employees also depend on it. Levi would like to enhance his business and buy a volume of raw materials such as cloth, zippers, sliders, thread, and other accessories for his business. Additional capital amounting to PHP 20,000 would be enough to meet his need. This will not only help him generate higher income and savings, but most importantly, it will endorse the use of locally made products and uphold the creativity of indigenous people. <br \/><br \/>Levi dreams for genuine happiness and a peaceful life with his wife and children. He wants to serve God together with them and his employees.

But due to an unfavorable financial position, her husband is not in condition to purchase these items for his business purpose.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Noureen has applied for a Kiva loan from its field partner BRAC Pakistan so that she can help her husband to purchase the above items for his business purpose. She is very thankful to Kiva and to BRAC Pakistan.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":62.83,"image":{"id":1964234,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

These children currently do longer attend school. The eldest works as a housekeeper and the second child helps her with her business. Yvonne\u2019s principle business and source of revenue consists of selling vegetables, but every May since 2009, she has made clay bricks with her husband to augment the family income in order to improve the family\u2019s living conditions. The number of bricks to make grows little by little, and this season, the goal is 40,000 bricks. Each year, the revenue generated by the production of bricks is always designated for an investment. Last year, for example, she bought a rice field, and this year, she envisions buying a cart and a zebu if possible.

Philippines. It\u2019s quite refreshing during the hot, dry season. It\u2019s also appealing during the rainy season. <br \/><br \/>Ronie, a 57-year-old from General Santos City, South Cotabato, chose to venture into ice cream-making in 2004. He took advantage of the good supply of fruits in the area and used them to make delicious ice cream. In almost eleven years, he was able to improve his business and employ ten helpers, including vendors. Ice cream vendors are commonly seen with movable carts roving in different communities, either urban or rural. They use a ringing bell to call the attention of residents to buy from them. <br \/><br \/>Ronie would like to make another cart and employ another vendor soon. He also needs additional supplies of fruits, milk, and other ice cream ingredients. He is making an appeal for a PHP 20,000 loan for this purpose. The additional income derived from this loan will provide for his family\u2019s daily needs as well as his children's college expenses. It will also sustain the needs of his ten workers. <br \/><br \/>Ronie is married to Marilou. They want to bestow a successful business to their children someday.

But as time passed by, many other stores proliferated in their community and it created a stiff competition in the same line of business. Therefore she continuously tries many techniques to make her store stable and competitive. She converted part of their house into a boarding house and ventured into load retailing for cellphones. In this way, her boarders are her captured customers for usual commodities and cellphone load. Somehow her income helps provide for their daily expenditures and higher education needs of her children.<br \/><br \/> It supplements the income of her husband, Bonifacio, a carpenter. But college education is really pocket-draining, so she strives really hard to increase her profit. She wants to add sacks of rice to her inventory and obtain more supplies of grocery items and beverages. She is requesting for PhP 30,000 loan for this purpose. Part of the loan will be allotted to buy load wallet for her e-loading business. <br \/><br \/>In due time, she hopes that her enterprises will advance fully and give her family a comfortable life.

Fruits and vegetables grow well because typhoons seldom visit the area. \n\nMardy, 39, is selling fruits in one of the markets in San Francisco, Agusan Del Sur. As of now she offers mangoes and watermelon but hopes to add durian soon. The profits derived from her business helps provide for the basic needs of her family. However, the risk that she faces is the possibility of rotting if her fruits are not sold on time. Somehow, Mardy has learned the trade tips from her five years of experience in fruit vending. Now she desires to buy more fruits to display in her stall in order to attract more buyers. Aside from this, she plans to repair the roof of her stall to adapt in the rainy season. She implores your kind support to make these things possible. A loan worth PhP 10,000 will surely go a long way. May you be God\u2019s blessing to her as she aspires to improve her business. \n\nMardy is married to Narciso, a small businessman, and they have children who are studying.

She is married to Aladar, a driver. Although they have no children, Eduviges is thankful that she has a hardworking and loving husband. Life may be hard but God has been faithful to the couple.\n\nEduviges owns and oversees operation of her jeepney service. She has a one unit (14-16 person capacity) of jeepney. Jeepneys are the most common and cheapest form of public transport throughout the many islands of the Philippines. They are one of the remnants of the American military presence in the Philippines during the second World War. The Filipinos saw possibilities to make out of these jeeps. They saw a real transportation means by making these jeeps about two meters longer and by putting two long seats in them, one on each side from the front to the back. Since then, jeepneys have been used as small buses to transport of people, goods, and even sometimes little animals.\n\nTo help her continue operations of her business, Eduviges is requesting a PHP 25000 loan which she will use to pay for spare parts like tires for her jeepney. It is very important that her unit is always in good running condition to ensure efficient and safe service to ensure continuous income. Her husband drives it, so she is assured that her jeepney is well taken cared of. Her jeepney passenger service means a lot to her since this has been their main source of living. She is thanking God and you in advance for the financial help that will be given her.\n\nEudviges hopes that their transport service will continue to be successful. She also prays for a simple and happy life.

","en":"Alimirza is 34, married, and does not have any children yet. He has a high school education and is responsible, honest, and hardworking. He has a lot of experience in agriculture, about 16 years, having first helped his parents before starting a business on his own. Thanks to his hard work, Alimirza currently has five cows, 16 sheep, and a horse. He grows watermelon, melons, onions, tomatoes, and other crops to sell on a 1.6 hectare plot of land. He has everything necessary for taking care of livestock and sends them out to pasture in the summer for grazing and fattening. On the whole, business has been going well, except that this year something unexpected happened. A short circuit blew out the motor at the water pumping station, causing a water shortage for irrigation. Alimirza could not save his crops, which withered and died. His losses totaled 500,000 som (KGS). Alimirza found out that it was possible to get a soft loan through Bai-Tushum Bank to restore his business, and he applied for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS) to prepare irrigated land for recovery and to purchase onion seeds. The harvest will help restore his losses and rebuild his business. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":1963475,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to rebuild his business and plant organic onions","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Nooken district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-08-28T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-27T02:10:02Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.14,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alimirza","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":308.86,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-19T13:11:33Z","rounded_local_amount":20197.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":16.14,"payment_id":752026505}],"funded_date":"2015-08-28T06:23:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Hendrickson","image":null}},{"id":938296,"name":"Cosma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Augustine is a 43-year-old man; he is married with five children, with four still attending school.

Trias, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Oprinilo, with whom she has three children; one is in college, another is at the elementary level and one is working already. Almost half of the Filipino people live in rural areas. Although Nerissa's family do not have any luxuries they are happy and content for as long they are intact, sharing three simple meals a day.<br \/><br \/>Nerissa has been operating a small general store and a fruit and veggies farm for a number of years already. She grows mostly bananas, coconut, tomatoes, eggplants, and bitter melon. Bananas are almost a staple in a Filipino meal. She sells dry and packaged food and household items directly to consumers. She sells her produce to their town market, and to fruit stores that she regularly supplies, and to the local community. <br \/><br \/>To help her continue operations of her businesses, she is requesting a PHP 50000 loan which she will use to pay for frozen foods such as marinated pork and beef, \"embotido\" (pork roll), meatballs, rice, fertilizer and other grocery items. She already has regular customers for her frozen food which is a popular among the working community for its convenience in cooking. Her store and farm's earnings help provide for their daily needs and in sending her children to school.<br \/><br \/>Nerissa dreams to own a house and be able to send her children to college.

As he grew up, he stayed in his own country and didn't go look for a job in a foreign country, like many other residents of his district did.  Navruz couldn't bear to leave his parents.  He feels particularly responsible for them.  So he stayed home and, like his father, he got involved in animal husbandry.\r\n\r\nNavruz is happy with his life and he is planning to get married soon.  Getting married is expensive though (you need money for the wedding ceremony, and  for the bride's dower).  Navruz has started to save some money.  He wants to expand his business and increase his income, so that he can save even more.  It is with this goal in mind that he is taking a loan to buy two calves.

She has three children; ages 3, 6, and 15.  Her business is selling food.  She is a very good mother.  She is generous and very self-sacrificing.  She conducts her business in the southern part of the city.  The area is known for its picturesque scenery and for its large and majestic trees.  Rita has a dark complexion, is short, and has an average build.  Her maternal language is Guaran\u00ed, and she speaks Spanish.  (She is the second one on the right, and she is wearing an amber sweater.)<br \/><br \/>She shares her life with her children, who go to school.  They live in a rented room built of wood with a tin roof and dirt floor.  <br \/><br \/>Her need to improve her business led her to form a bank of people with businesses like selling second-hand clothes, locksmith, bakery, selling cosmetics, selling soft drinks, leather handicrafts, and selling cheese.  Her business is selling food like 'patasca' [pork stew with corn].  This food is known for the time it takes to cook.  \"You need between 12 and 13 hours on the fire.  This is to savor very early in the morning.  Some people consume patasca as a cure for a hangover,\" she says.<br \/><br \/>The advantage of her business is that her food is very popular.

He requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for his business, but without any success.
