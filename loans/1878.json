At each monthly meeting where the group works on loan payments, they also have a learning session with an important topic presented in their Maya language by the Friendship Bridge Facilitator.  The Facilitator has visual aides like photos, diagrams and charts that make the topic easier to understand.  The topics are all very useful for the women\u2019s daily lives.  They cover health, family life and business management.  <br \/><br \/>The women are all extremely grateful to Kiva investors for making these programs possible.

She buys personal products such as beauty products, cosmetics and toiletries from popular direct-selling brands at a lower price than shown on the catalog, and sells them at a profit.

Demand for her personal products has significantly increased as school time has started in the Philippines. Filipinos prefer to buy these branded personal goods for their good quality. <br \/><br \/>She is hoping for your positive response as this will really help her increase her business, and thus help her daughter pursue a college degree.<br \/><br \/>Lelita aims to grow her business to allow them a better future.

Fishing or catching tuna is the usual livelihood of many residents of the area. Reynsie Joy, 37 years old, is selling tuna in a public market in Calumpang, General Santos City for 16 years already. It\u2019s the source of her family\u2019s daily household needs and her children\u2019s educational expenses. <br \/><br \/>But now the rainy season gives her difficulty to earn enough for her family. The price of tuna increases during this season and she can hardly afford it. This is the reason why Reynsie Joy is appealing for additional capital worth PhP 60,000 to augment her business.  She can use this to buy high volume of tuna in order to keep her business running even during rainy days. Her profit from this will add to the income of her husband, Mat, who drives his own tricycle. Eventually her goal is to make her business prosper, gain stability in the midst of stiff competition, complete her children\u2019s education, and enjoy a better living condition someday.<br \/><br \/>Reynsie Joy is looking forward to seeing her kids finish their schooling and wear their professional clothes. She also gives importance to peaceful and harmonious living with her family. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":541.7,"image":{"id":1964339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy high volume of tuna to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"General Santos City, South Cotabato","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-08-28T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-27T14:50:03Z","loan_amount":1300,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reynsie Joy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":325.02,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":15159.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955446},{"amount":216.68,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":10106.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045290}],"funded_date":"2015-09-24T16:54:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":938537,"name":"Rosenda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosenda is 47 years old and single with four children,all of whom arestill in school.

region called Shahrituz, which is the warmest place in the whole country.

She also buys scrap metals, bottles, plastics, papers and boards from scavengers. Marilou organizes it before selling to a junk shop. She contemplates on possible ways to enhance her business. She hopes that in due time, her variety store will grow into a grocery that will also sell rice and school supplies. For now, she focuses on her scrap business because it helps many individual scavengers and it contributes a lot to the recycling process in their town. Marilou applied for a PHP 10,000 loan partly to buy scrap and partly to procure more supplies for her store. Additional income that will be derived from this loan will help cover daily expenses and the tuition fees of her four children who are studying in high school and elementary school. She and her husband Rey, a government employee, are working hard to achieve their dream of their children completing their education.\r\n\r\nMarilou is committed to CCT Credit Cooperative\u2019s vision to alleviate poverty and she regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

married, and has three sons. For the past six years she has run her own business to provide the family's primary source of income. Thanks to her persistence she now owns two cows and one hectare of land where she grows corn.

This is the fruit of a number of years of work by Williams. He is a 33 year old entrepreneur who only completed primary school but had the vision of a great businessman and it didn't take long to become one. Perseverance, his savings and a passion for getting ahead  have helped this merchant, who besides having his store has also managed to build two other to rent and thus have other revenues. <br \/><br \/>Williams is one of those inspiring people who on hearing their story makes people motivated to start themselves. Plus his insistence to continue growing leaves him no doubt about continuing to invest in his store.

Thanks to her tireless hard work, today Kunduz has five cows. She grows clover for sale and for personal consumption on 0.40 hectares of land. In order to further expand her business, Kunduz turned to the bank Bai Tushum for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy construction materials to finish building her house and consequently, to improve her family's living conditions.

married.  She has a specialized secondary education and works as a nurse.  She has also worked for 21 years in agriculture, and owns 20 sheep, 2 horses, an orchard, and a 1.92 hectare plot of land on which she raises beans.

Because she is seeking the best for her family, she is applying to FUSAI for a loan to invest in galvanized metal sheeting, wood, and wire in order to replace the metal sheets of the walls and roof of her home and offer security to her daughter."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":63.19,"image":{"id":1964529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to invest in galvanized metal sheets, wood, and wire in order to replace the metal of the walls and roof of her house and offer security to her daughter.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2015-08-29T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-28T03:00:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria De Los Angeles ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":20.06},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":22.07},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":22.47},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":23.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":24.26},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":25.52},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":26.46},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":27.17},{"due_date":"2016-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":28.44},{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":29.29},{"due_date":"2016-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":30.57},{"due_date":"2016-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":31.57},{"due_date":"2016-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":32.77},{"due_date":"2016-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":34.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.07},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.47},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.72},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.26},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.52},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.46},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.17},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.44},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.29},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.57},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.57},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.77},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.23,"local_amount":43.23,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T12:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":43.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730921437},{"amount":19.96,"local_amount":19.96,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":19.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752012153}],"funded_date":"2015-09-26T01:42:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":938997,"name":"Ma.

She has a higher education and works as a kindergarten teacher.  In 1994 Gulbarchyn started her own business raising cattle and farming, starting with a sum of 3,500 KGS, which she used to purchase livestock.

She began her business of selling beauty products when she was pregnant, since she needed to generate income for her sustenance, since she was a single mother.

She started pursuing her passion in the year 2012. She is a hardworking and honest farmer who is based in Kangutu, a remote village in the Nkubu area of Kenya. She is a proud mother of four lovely children. For the past three years she has been making a small living through practicing mixed farming. Her primary source of income has been selling banana, milk and eggs to the nearby market. She also engages in a personal business or \u201cside hustle\u201d as she likes to call it, to earn additional income. Beatrice passionately loves banana farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is accessing funds to increase her business. Through Juhudi Kilimo, an organization that supports enterprising farmers, she acquired her first loan which she paid back fully. She also benefited from training and the impact of the first loan cannot be underestimated. Beatrice is seeking another loan from Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva lenders, to buy more banana seeds so that she can plant more banana trees. The banana seeds she plans to buy is not just an ordinary banana seed, but of quality. Bananas cost more money and with this loan she will get a lot of profits and also satisfy the demand that is in her village for bananas. From this loan, the life of Beatrice will permanently change and she will be able to secure the future of her school-going children. She will also assure her aging parents of a secure future. Beatrice waits for your

He then decided to work in agriculture to grow basic grains. Little by little he saved money and bought a property to work as his own growing basic grains, bananas, cacao to sell. With a lot of effort and dedication he was able to save money which he invested in a small business to sell one or two calves for resale. There is no electricity in his community thus he is asking for  a loan to buy a solar system which will be installed in his house. This will benefit his family members because his child is beginning to study and he could do his homework at night. Besides, it would help illuminate the house at night to help clients who come to buy product. He will be able to charge his cell phone to be able to always communicate with his clients and relatives and do much more.
