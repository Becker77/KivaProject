Su negocio lo realiza en el barrio \u2018plan 3000\u2019 caracterizada porque sus pobladores son sobrevivientes de un turbi\u00f3n del rio en los a\u00f1os setentas.\nMilena es de cabello blanco, baja estatura y f\u00edsico delgado (al centro lleva una cartera marr\u00f3n).

She lives with her spouse and has 6 children, aged 4, 5, 6, 7, 21 and 22. Her business is a traditional bread bakery.<br \/><br \/>She is a good mother, and a very hard worker. She runs her business in the \u2018Plan 3000\u2019 neighborhood. It is  characterized by its residents, who are survivors of a river flood  in the seventies. <br \/><br \/>Milena has white hair, short stature, and a thin build (she is in the middle with a brown wallet). Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed and she speaks Spanish. She shares her life with her spouse, who works in transportation, and their children. The older ones work and the younger ones are in school. They live in their own home built of wood with a metal sheeting roof and a dirt floor.  Her dream to improve her business led to her leading a bank of people with businesses such as selling food, selling second hand clothing, ceramic crafts, selling beverages, selling fruit, selling vegetables, selling flowers and selling empanadas. Her business is a traditional bread bakery. She sells traditional bread such as cu\u00f1ap\u00e9 (a small roll made of yucca flour with cheese), rice empanada (baked rice and cheese), wheat biscuits (hard wheat rolls), Arepas (corn meal pancakes mixed with cheese and fried) and more. \u201cWho doesn't drink some coffee in the afternoon with traditional baked bread? They're the flavors of my people that we enjoy every day\u2026\u201d she remarks. The advantage of her business is that she sells everyday. The disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy an industrial oven and a gas tank. Her dream is to have a well consolidated business. She want to purchase an industrial oven and a gas tank to bake traditional bread. This is her fourth loan cycle with the institution in the 4 years she has been doing this activity.  <br \/><br \/>These are the reasons that Milena is asking for a loan to buy an industrial oven and a gas tank to bake traditional bread."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1880.06,"image":{"id":1964635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy an industrial oven and gas tank to bake traditional bread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-08-29T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-28T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":5525,"lender_count":118,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yuwinka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faviola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carola               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vanesa           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-27T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":38000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":5525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-26T04:00:00Z","amount":4092.41},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T04:00:00Z","amount":4340.18},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T04:00:00Z","amount":4498.15},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T04:00:00Z","amount":4661.89},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T04:00:00Z","amount":4831.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T04:00:00Z","amount":5007.45},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T04:00:00Z","amount":5189.73},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T04:00:00Z","amount":5378.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":595.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":631.04},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":654.01},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":677.81},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":702.49},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":728.06},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":754.56},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":782.02}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1226.05,"local_amount":8432.59,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-22T12:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":8447.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732297007},{"amount":654.01,"local_amount":4498.15,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:07:36Z","rounded_local_amount":4505.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752077138}],"funded_date":"2015-09-27T00:39:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":938407,"name":"Osmar Adin","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Osmar, de 27 a\u00f1os de edad, no tuvo la oportunidad de asistir a la escuela, est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ado y su pareja se dedica a los oficios del hogar, tienen dos hijos que por el momento no estudian y solo los cuatro viven en casa. \n\nOsmar, es agricultor en peque\u00f1o y desde su infancia le ayudaba a su padre a sembrar y fue as\u00ed como aprendi\u00f3, adem\u00e1s de eso tambi\u00e9n trabaja como jornalero, actualmente va a sembrar 7,000 metros cuadrados de ma\u00edz y los cultivar\u00e1 a 15 minutos de su casa y se trasporta en bicicleta. \n\nOsmar, necesita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar insumos agr\u00edcolas como abono y pesticidas, para que cuando empiece a llover pueda sembrar y estar preparado para aplicar sus productos a la milpa en los d\u00edas que le corresponda. \n\nOsmar, desea que las condiciones clim\u00e1ticas cambien, porque de esa cosecha depende el sustento de la familia.\n","en":"Osmar is 27 years old.

For this reason Jos\u00e9 is requesting financing from Soluz Honduras to obtain a solar system which will help him be a better grower and producer and, in the future when his son goes to school, he will have enough light to do his homework every day. <br \/><br \/>Jos\u00e9 de 25 a\u00f1os quien vive en Olanchito, Honduras es productor de caf\u00e9 desde hace cinco a\u00f1os  esto le genera ingresos para sostener a su familia, ya que adem\u00e1s cultiva granos b\u00e1sicos como el ma\u00edz y frijol. Jos\u00e9 es un hombre muy emprendedor, por esa raz\u00f3n desea convertirse en un buen productor de caf\u00e9 y hacer todo lo que este a su alcance para que su hijo tenga una buena educaci\u00f3n. Como productor de caf\u00e9 el necesita tener una buena iluminaci\u00f3n para expulpar el caf\u00e9 por la noche, y as\u00ed poder avanzar en la labor diaria, pero esto se le dificulta un poco, porqu\u00e9 en la comunidad donde vive no hay acceso a energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica, por esta raz\u00f3n Jos\u00e9 solicita financiamiento a Soluz Honduras para adquirir un sistema solar que le ayudara a mejorar sus labores como cultivado"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":90.59,"image":{"id":1964664,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy a solar system that will improve living conditions in his home as well as avoid the contamination caused by traditional energy use.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Olanchito","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":390,"posted_date":"2015-08-29T14:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-28T14:30:04Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":959.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":973.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":988.1},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1002.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1017.96},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1033.23},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1048.73},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1064.46},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1080.43},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1096.64},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1113.09},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1129.78},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1146.73},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1163.93},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1181.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.96},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.63},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.32},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.01},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.72},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.43},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.16},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.9},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.64},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.4},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.18},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.96},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.75},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.56},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":90.59,"local_amount":1932.61,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:32:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1992,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752258345}],"funded_date":"2015-09-04T17:33:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Jean Fickes"}},{"id":938398,"name":"Miladis Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Miladis, de 54 a\u00f1os de edad, es comerciante, vive junto a su hija y su peque\u00f1o nieto, su hija se dedica a la venta de tamales y pan.\n\nMiladis, posee una peque\u00f1a tienda desde hace 3 a\u00f1os y fue su hija quien la motiv\u00f3 a que colocara una tienda en su peque\u00f1o hogar y es de ah\u00ed de donde provienen sus ingresos.\n\nMiladis, solicita el cr\u00e9dito para comprar productos de la canasta b\u00e1sica como: arroz, frijoles, az\u00facar entre otros productos que son de importancia y de gran relevancia.\n\nSu sue\u00f1o es seguir manteniendo satisfechos a sus clientes, pues ella sabe muy bien que ellos soy el factor m\u00e1s importante en su negocio.","en":"Miladis, 54 years old, is a saleswoman.

Su taller lo apertur\u00f3 en el a\u00f1o 2012 y cuenta con amplia clientela a quienes confecciona todo tipo de prenda de vestir, camisas, pantalones, vestidos, uniformes de colegios, entre otros y realiza todas las operaciones de la confecci\u00f3n, dise\u00f1o, corte, preparaci\u00f3n, ensamble, acabado de piezas y empaque de productos; sus clientes se han mantenido fieles con el pasar del tiempo, pues brinda un excelente servicio y elabora sus prendas sobre medida y a la vanguardia.

","en":"Rita is a young woman passionate about clothing design who, when she was a girl, made many outfits for her dolls and through this was making herself into a young woman who was a lot more interested in this art and managed to to get into a government school where she learned to sew with all the existing techniques. However, she continued improving her sewing by taking courses on designing patterns, all sorts of shirts and t-shirts, pants, scaling and straight stitch machines. Her shop was opened in 2012 and has a broad customer base for whom she sews all sorts of clothing, shirts, pants, dresses, school uniforms, and more, and she does all the tasks of sewing: designing, cutting, preparing, assembling, finishing the pieces, and packing the products. Her customers have stayed loyal over time, since she offers excellent service and makes their clothing to measure and in the latest style. With this wide range of products and demand of orders, she decided that her business should grow a lot more, so she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, which she will invest in a straight stitch sewing machine, a cutting table, an industrial cutter, and raw materials. This investment will strengthen her technical infrastructure, her production capacity and her working capital. Her goal for the future is to expand her sewing and give her two children a better future by purchasing them a house."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":147.34,"image":{"id":1964689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to purchase a straight stitch sewing machine, a cutting table, an industrial cutter and raw materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-08-29T14:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-28T14:50:04Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rita Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":4300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":231196},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":238132},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":245276},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":252634},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":260213},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":268020},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":276060},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":284342},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":292872},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":301658},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":310708},{"due_date":"2016-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":320029},{"due_date":"2016-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":329630},{"due_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":339519},{"due_date":"2016-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":349711}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.76},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.01},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.32},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.69},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.15},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.27},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.95},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.71},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.55},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.47},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.49},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.59},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":72.58,"local_amount":231196,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":235077.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730994785},{"amount":74.76,"local_amount":238132,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":242129.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752082728}],"funded_date":"2015-08-30T09:27:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Wendy Harris","image":null}},{"id":938654,"name":"Vincent","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vincent is a first-year student at Kepler.

It provides a lot of benefits to the people in their community in Barotac Viejo, Iloilo. Daisy owns a fishing boat and several fishing nets that her husband uses for fishing. Sometimes her neighbors rent it from her. She also earns from the sea by selling varieties of fish in the market. Their combined income provides for the usual needs and education of their four young children. \n\nAs Daisy aspires to save more for the future, she plans to buy another pump boat which she can rent out to the neighborhood. She needs PHP 50,000 for this. She also intends to allot some amount for additional volume of fish in different varieties. She hopes to increase her income in this way. It will ensure the continuity of her business even during rainy season. \n\nDaisy dreams to see her children with a college diploma and a stable career in the future.

It\u2019s one of the reasons why she also ventured into direct selling business to augment her family\u2019s expenses. She buys cellphone accessories such as battery, casing, pouch, and also fashion wrist watches and sunglasses. While she looks after her store, her husband sells these items downtown. Sometimes he offers it house to house.\n\nNow Merly is requesting for a PHP 50,000 additional capital mainly to buy additional merchandise for her store and more items for direct selling business. With this, she can continuously sustain their everyday needs and children\u2019s expenses. In few years time, she will be relieved of huge educational expenses and her dream to enjoy a little comfort in life will come true.\n\nMerly is committed to CCT Credit Cooperative\u2019s vision to alleviate poverty and she regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

cities. Products here are measured by piece, kilo or by volume. Compared to supermarkets, products in a variety store are much cheaper. They are known as \u201csari-sari\u201d stores which means \u201cto have many choices\u201d. You can see there grills instead of glass as a protection against theft. Many housewives preferred to manage this type of business since this can be established in the comfort of their own home while taking care of their families, like Robelyn, a sari-sari store owner for many years now. Every month, she earns about PHP 15,000 enough to sustain her daily needs.<br \/><br \/>Robelyn is grateful that she became a member of Center for Community Transformation (CCT) since they provide seminars and coach new entrepreneurs on how to manage their business correctly. They also tell aspiring business owners how Kiva can help them grow their business since there are lenders all over the globe willing to help entrepreneurs that are otherwise financially incapable. <br \/><br \/>Robelyn applied for a PHP 10, 000 loan since she really wanted her variety store business to flourish for the future of her children. The money will be used to buy additional grocery items and different types of rice. She\u2019s hoping that Kiva lenders will consider her story.

They have three children who are already working. They live in Barotac Viejo, Iloilo. At her old age, she can still manage to run a small canteen or food stall. For almost eight years, her business has been a very helpful source of additional income for her family. \n\nSmall canteen is commonly known in the Philippines as \u201ccarenderia\u201d. Most of Filipino families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal.  But if there is only one or two family members present for dinner, they would prefer to buy cooked viand or food. This is a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one or two people when buying cooked rice and viands costs less than raw food. This is the reason why Heide\u2019s carenderia business is considered valuable. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community, students and working people. \n\nBut the presence of other carenderia threatens her business. She needs to improve her place to make it more appealing to customers. She is praying for a PhP 50,000 loan to buy materials needed to repair her canteen. Part of the loan will be allotted for additional quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, and seasonings. \n\nShe meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from her studies of the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

He has taken a loan from a financial institution before, but because of the family's poor conditions, Armen wasn't able to pay it back. However, over these years of tireless work, after income started to appear, Armen thinks that it is high time to develop the farm, which is profitable enough to cover monthly payments. <br \/><br \/>Armen has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International.

Being a side card operator is not an easy job since on a daily basis she needs to check if something needs to be repaired and she also needs to educate bicycle drivers on how to properly take care of the vehicle. Every time something needs to be repaired is a challenge and an expense for her business.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful that lenders were able to help her financially with the business. She was able to buy grocery items for her variety store and had supplementary capital for the maintenance of her side car units. She wants to thank dear lenders for the monetary support they have provided.  \r\n\r\nSince being sick nowadays can't be avoided, every time a driver needs to take a leave for being sick is one challenge that she considers in the business  since it will also affect her income. Loida applied for a P15,000 loan and she is more focused on her side car transportation business.

Most Filipinos prefer to have this type of business, since this can be done in the comfort of their own homes while earning money and still be with their families. That\u2019s why Eutiquio, a 45-year-old businessman, and husband of Jesicca from Parola, Philippines, established his own sari-sari store. He started the store in 2011 and continually manages the business. <br \/><br \/>Eutiquio dreams to expand his store to have a wide array of product choices. Eutiquio is continually formulating marketing strategies for the business\u2019 success, since this really helped him sustain their daily expenses and other basic needs.<br \/><br \/>Eutiquio wants to thank Center for Community Transformation (CCT) for their untiring support for every new entrepreneur like him, since they also conduct lectures on how to manage the business properly.

They plan to purchase two calves, fertilizer and organic pesticides for land cultivation. <br \/>Arpine has taken a loan from a financial institution before, but because of the family's poor conditions, she wasn't able to pay it back. However, over these years of tireless work, she was able to own her job, which is profitable enough to cover monthly payments of a loan. <br \/><br \/>Arpine has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International.

Sari-sari store is a Filipino word which means \u201cvariety\u201d where customers can select wide variety of choices for a cheaper price compare to supermarkets and other convenience store. Aside from managing a variety store business she also sell different foods for breakfast.\n\nSofia aims to step up every year in the business, on the past six months she considers the business growing with God as her greatest provider. This year she wants to expand her variety store business by adding additional products and stocks so that customers will have variety of choices. She wants the variety store to become a one-stop-shop to customers. With this, Sofia applied for another loan of P15, 000 to buy stocks of grocery items, sacks of rice, eggs and school supplies. \n\nSofia regularly meets with her co-fellowship members to share her life\u2019s testimony, experience on the business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and listen to the Word of God.

She sells dry and packaged food and household items directly to consumers. She also has a small canteen by her store. She has been in that business for seven years already and has established a good name in her community.<br \/><br \/>To help her continue the operations of her businesses, she is seeking a PHP 19000 loan which she will use to pay for canned goods, biscuits, bread, coffee, powdered milk, chocolate, beverages, and toiletries. Part of the loan she will use to buy ingredients to cook meals at her canteen. She trusts your good heart to support her in her livelihood. <br \/><br \/>Annie hopes to sustain and grow her business so she could send all her children to college. Education is a great equalizer among the rich and the poor.

Cecilia needs a loan to purchase materials to increase production and to rent a store to keep the artifacts. Cecilia planned to use part of her income generated from sales to support her husband to cater to their children and the remaining will be invested into the business. She thanks all her Kiva lenders for their financial support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1966183,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy materials such as wood, paint, and polish to increase her production and to rent a storeroom to keep her artifacts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Ajumako","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":392,"posted_date":"2015-08-30T09:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-09-29T09:40:06Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Comfort","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adwoa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patience","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-08-30T14:14:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":939299,"name":"Mukazi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mukazi is a first-year student at Kepler.
