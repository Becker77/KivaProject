Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

are below 15 years of age. They live in a three-room house in Nanga-Street, a quarter in Bamenda-NW regions in Cameroon. Immaculate has decided to work extra hard to assist her husband to address the needs of such a big family. She has faced so many challenges in life such as inadequate funds to sustain her business project and ill health. These challenges made life uncomfortable for her, until 18th September 2007 when she discovered GHAPE and became a member. In that same year, Immaculate received her first loan of 40,000FRS and her repayment was successful. The profit she made was plowed back into her business capital of buying and selling. \n\nGiven a loan, she plans to buy firewood for 50,000FRS, dry corn and groundnuts for 46,500FRS, two buckets of groundnuts for 16,0000FRS, koki beans for 21,000FRS, two bags of salt, and magi for 27,500FRS and transportation for 29,000FRS.  She plans to contribute 90,000FRS ($180 USD) of her own personal savings in order to carry out this business plan.  \n\nImmaculate will start repayments from the day the loan is disbursed.  She is quite convinced the business will succeed because of her manner of approach to her customers, the way she usually displays her goods and the experience she is already having in the business. Her business will help her community through the taxes she will be paying will help to foster the economic growth in the area. With the profit from the business, she plans to pay her children school fees, and uses part to expand on her business. She prefer to receive loans from GHAPE because of the social education GHAPE due offers, and the method of repayment is convenient.\n\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":236017,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buying and selling of corn, Beans, and Groundnut.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Nanga Street, Bamenda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6 12","type":"point"}},"partner_id":40,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Immaculate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":null,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":6250},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elrico Mu\u00f1oz","image":279082}},{"id":82499,"name":"Rosas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosas es socia del Banco Comunal Inti que quiere decir Sol en quechua.\nRosas es conviviente, tiene 25 a\u00f1os y 1 hijo, Rosas vende ropa a pedidos, sus productos los ofrece a amigos, familiares, conocidos, sus productos los adquiere en la ciudad de Lima a donde viaja semanalmente. \nRosas necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 1200 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de ropa variada.\nLos sue\u00f1os de Rosas son salir adelante, incrementar su capital y que su hijo sea profesional.\n","en":"Rosas is a member of the Inti community bank, a name that comes from the Quechuan word for \"sun\".

Mernie A., who is now 46, has always followed this wise counsel. Her husband Joeffrey is a farmer and also helps her run her business.  They live in Purok Mabinuligon, Brgy. Busay, Bago City, Negros Occidental with their 6 children, aged 14 to 25. One of their children already has a family, the 2 youngest are still in school, and the rest are working to help the family improve their lot. Mernie hopes that her business will continue to prosper so that she can earn enough to send her younger children to college and also to invest in other business ventures so that they can increase their family income.\r\n\r\nAs a mother who went through a lot of sacrifices while she was growing up because her family was very poor, Mernie does not want her children to go through the same difficulties of having to earn a living just to help support the family. When she got married, she decided to start her own business by opening a general store. She also raised livestock like pigs and ducks in her backyard, but she stopped this at some point because she needed to revolve her capital faster, and so decided to concentrate on expanding her general store operations.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access the necessary capital to expand and diversify her business. As the years passed and she continued to maintain her good credit record, her loans allowed her to sell rice and eggs in addition to her general store. From her business income she was able to buy a small plot of land to grow rice. From her business activities she is able to earn a monthly income of PHP 4,000.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 19,000 was used as additional working capital for her general store and rice business. She was able to repay this amount on time within her loan term. Now she is borrowing PHP 19,500 as additional working capital for her general store and rice business.  This will be her 18th loan. She intends to save some of the additional income for the education of her children, and use some to buy piglets to raise to expand her business.\r\n \r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":433868,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Jamshed is 31 years old. He is married with 4 children. Jamshed has a small restaurant where he sells breakfast, lunch and dinner. Prior to opening his own business, he worked at a restaurant where he learned the ins and outs of the trade. \r\n\r\nWhen Jamshed first started his business, he only opened to sell breakfast because he worked at night. Once his place became more popular, he was able to dedicate his whole time to the business. \r\n\r\nJamshed wants the loan so he may invest in tables, chairs and utensils.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband, Rolando T., age 57, works as an electrician to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have six children between the ages of 7 and 24. Two of her children are already working while the other four attend school. The family lives in Prk. Caticong, Brgy. Cabadiangan, Compostela, Cebu City. \r\n\r\nGina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired toward something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gina  has been working hard and incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,000, which has helped raise the family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 23,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her networking business so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Gina T. is truly a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Dungganon is a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable.\" Through this alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities they could not have imagined. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She says that these business have been going well and that are providing an income for their household.\r\n\r\nShe started selling chickens because she wanted to help cover her family's expenses and she wanted her husband to feel supported and thus inspired to keep working hard.   \r\n\r\nShe is using her profits to purchase more chickens and wood for her husband's carpentry, which has also been a great help towards covering their expenses. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to be able to save money and support her husband, so that they can succeed together as a family.\r\n\r\nShe joined the group after reading FRAC advertisements posted in her neighborhood. She sought out other interested people, and they formed a group named Piedra Grande after the community they live in.\r\n\r\nThe three members of the group are as follows:\r\nAlicia S\u00e1nchez M.: She will use the loan money to purchase chickens to sell them butchered and seasoned, as well as the purchase of wood and paintings for a separate carpentry business.\r\n\r\nJes\u00fas M.

and harvesting taro for sale. She has many years of experience in this business. Tuavao needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed killers, such as Gramoxome. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Tuavao joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is Tuavao's first loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self esteem.

Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital; you can start with one or two and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiple naturally! Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Third, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of

In this plantation, she has a problem because she does not have enough money to buy fertilizer. In order to deal this problem, Mr. Sandab K.'s wife decided to request a loan to purchase fertilizer to make her crops more productive. This couple has three children, one of whom is employed in a garment factory, another attends the local school, and the youngest one is too young to work or study. Mr. Sandab K. is not requesting the loan but his wife is, so she is shown in the photo.  \r\n\r\nAll the members of this group have end-of-term (EoT) loans so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. These loans allow borrowers to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

He has been driving cars since he was very young, and for this reason 8 years ago he began working in public transportation by providing taxi service.  He likes this job because he can work a schedule that is convenient to him since he has his own car.  He does not like traffic during rush hour.  On the other hand, this job allows him to interact with people, which is something that greatly pleases him, and he does not get bored.  It is also very profitable because the money he earns allows him to provide a better quality of life for his family.  In the future, Cristian wants to start a hardware shop in his home in order to have a calmer business than driving the taxi.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is the third loan he has had with MFP, and he does not want to let his other group members down, and so he promises to be punctual in his loan payments.  Cristian plans to invest the requested money in car maintenance and also to begin to buy merchandise for his future hardware store, as he wants to start it as soon as possible.  He is also planning to sell his car someday to use that money to better stock his future business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":480574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Car maintenance and investing in a new business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-01-30T06:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":335}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.55},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960316},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993161},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717947},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751621},{"amount":116.55,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:43Z","rounded_local_amount":333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934089},{"amount":117.25,"local_amount":335,"processed_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:34Z","rounded_local_amount":335.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672864}],"funded_date":"2010-01-30T10:33:18Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Meinecke","image":557397}},{"id":177242,"name":"Justine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Justine is a 38 year-old mother of three teenage girls.

They live together in the beautiful Cuzco rainforest, in the community of Manitea Alta, where they have their own home. She barely completed secondary school, but that hasn\u2019t prevented her from working in agriculture.  She recalls that she had to work hard to establish herself in farming  and tells how she put a lot of determination and dedication into getting a good yield of crops.   What\u2019s more, her produce is organic and doesn\u2019t harm the environment as she uses artisanal techniques to take care of her crops. Ana knows that her children will take over the business in the future.  So, of course she is teaching them how to properly manage and care for their plantations while preserving the environment at the same time. Her produce is recognized in her community for its good quality.  That is why the big wholesalers come to her farm to buy it and offer her a competitive price. Usually she works with her partner, but sometimes she gets help from her children.  However at harvest time, she needs laborers to assist in the gathering of her crops. In the near future, she hopes to grow coffee, as she needs to attract new customers. This is her sixth loan with MFP and as such she agrees to pay on time.  She is also happy with the good decisions that are being made by her communal group. The loan she is requesting will be invested in the purchase of more fertile land, as she needs to increase her productivity and income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Eleanor Francoletti-Putz, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":551281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase land for cultivation and to increase her productivity","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-13T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2066.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326781}],"funded_date":"2010-06-15T13:40:31Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eleanor Francoletti-Putz","image":null}},{"id":210369,"name":"Veronica","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Veronica B. is from the village of Malaubang, Ozamiz City.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Her business has since expanded and she has some regular clients. \r\n\r\nBlanca has been getting credit from FODEMI for six years and has found that she has increased her sales so that she could provide a better quality of life for her children. Her goals for the future are to continue to have faith and hope, and to proceed with the support of her family.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

L\u00f3pez is 54 years old, single and has two daughters, both of whom are grown up and married. Her goal is to make the necessary improvements to her home so her children can enjoy it in the future. Her wish is to establish a convenience store with all the necessary elements and dedicate herself completely to the business and receive a pension, since she needs the income to pay for her medications. Lidia has looked for a way to work, and in doing this started selling beans, firewood and beverages, among other items, and always has enjoyed it. She taught her children the trade so they'd learn the difficulty of hard work and making money. Her dream is for God to grant her a long life so she can teach her children to work hard and how to administer her business, since it is important for them to have a source of income. <p>\r\nLidia's main economic activity is selling undergarments, beverages, cooked beans and firewood. Her business is located in her home on the side of Dilectus restaurant. She has had her business for 12 years, which started out of her desire to make headway and out of the necessity to find a source of income to cover household expenses and provide for her two daughters. With a fixed primary educational plan, the idea came to her she could teach her children and also tend to her business. That way when she gave them lessons in the mornings she could take care of the business as well, and in the afternoons could focus fully on her work.  As time passed she decided to start offering undergarments by order and on credit. She is requesting a loan to purchase beauty products and other convenience store products to take advantage of the season and because her clientele is constantly requesting new products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":263614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase beauty products and other convenience store supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-31T01:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia Del Transito ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1363.64},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1363.64},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1363.64},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1363.64},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1363.64},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1363.64},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1363.64},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1363.64},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1363.64},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1363.64},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1363.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":1363.64,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1370.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400029},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":1363.64,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1370.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092027},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":1363.64,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1370.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985410},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":1363.64,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:10:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1370.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446025},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":1363.64,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1370.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956664},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":1363.64,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-05T09:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1370.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66055579},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":1363.64,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:29:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1370.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599705},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":1363.64,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1370.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035596},{"amount":136.36,"local_amount":2727.28,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2741.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789976},{"amount":68.2,"local_amount":1363.6,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:32:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1370.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680671}],"funded_date":"2009-01-31T14:08:44Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T13:32:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":90723,"name":"Yot","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"C., 33, has requested a loan of $600 to buy a new motorbike to support her business investment because she wants to have an easier work flow during her buying and selling procedures.

From early in the morning till late in the evening he herds his cattle, and on weekends he travels to market to buy and sell cattle.  Sometimes he purchases a steer to slaughter and sell to the butcher, which is very profitable.  With his latest loan, he purchased two cows and a calf.  One of them is a milk cow, with which his wife is delighted.

Euloge is the father of two children all attending school. The family lives together and the couple provides for the family\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\nEuloge attended school up to University level. However, for the last 15 years he has been selling office supplies in his store located in Abokicodji. Euloge gets his goods at Dantokpa, international market of Benin. \r\n\r\nHe is a previous ALID\u00e9 client; he has already obtained five loans from the institution. These five loans have all been fully reimbursed.\r\nEuloge\u2019 s clientele expands more and more each day and he can no longer meet the needs of all his customers.

That describes our client Darnell. In the midst of the country's financial situation in early 2008, Darnell saw an opportunity to help others move ahead of chaos and began his business consulting practice.\r\n\r\nAs a consultant to small businesses, Darnell\u2019s advice has helped turn businesses around \u2013 instead of losing money, businesses become profitable. What is most important to him about his work is that these businesses can keep people from losing their jobs and even generate more jobs. While Darnell certainly enjoys getting paid to help small business owners improve their companies, helping employees keep their jobs is, in many ways, even better.\r\n\r\nDarnell is also helping his clients\u2019 businesses become socially responsible by \u201cgreening\u201d their practices and missions. He helps the less-advantaged parts of his community through donating \"pro bono\" (without charge) consulting services. He feels that the education his company imparts to others through its consulting is a worthwhile, meaningful contribution to his community.\r\n\r\nDarnell will use his ACCION USA loan to hire additional employees, expanding his current staff of five. So many clients have been happy with his services, and have referred other clients to Darnell, that he is now able to grow his business. So while helping other companies grow and expand, Darnell gets to do the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":9575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":9575,"image":{"id":541481,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To

The official name of this borrowing group is 'Marigold'.\r\n\r\nHoneylyn is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Honeylyn owns & operates a specialized retail store.

Honeylyn has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Honeylyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Honeylyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Honeylyn is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Honeylyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His main job is teaching illiterate senior citizens to read and write.  This activity provides him income since it\u2019s paid for by the Peruvian State. \r\n\r\nIn his spare time, though, he works on his farmland.  Every morning with the sun\u2019s first rays he heads out to his coffee, banana, avocado and achiote fields which are located about an hour away.  What he most enjoys about his work is tilling the soil, something he does with much dedication.  He\u2019s been in this line of work for 20 years and considers the most difficult part having to work in two places at the same time because there's never enough time.  For later on, he plans to buy new land to expand his crops because he currently has only one hectare.\r\n\r\nHe belongs to the \u201cAlianza al Progreso\u201d (Alianza toward Progress) communal bank and this is the second MFP loan where he knows that he has to make his installment payments on time because that\u2019s a rule of his communal bank.

She lives with her husband and children in a small community called Trinchera de Pital which is located in the province of Alajuela, a province whose main activities are livestock production and agriculture, with a focus on the cultivation of pineapples which are mainly marketed overseas in international markets. For this reason, community development has been growing in recent years creating an increased demand for products and services providing greater job opportunities.\r\n\r\nJulieta makes clothes for every type of person. She sells her garments to residents in the community who are very satisfied with the quality. \r\n\r\nJulieta is currently applying for a small loan of \u20a1600.000 (six hundred thousand colones) (CRC) to buy material for sewing. With this investment she hopes to grow her small business more, serve more clients and offer them better clothes. All this will help improve her living conditions.\r\n\r\nJulieta is a member of the communal bank Mujeres al \u00c9xito de la Trinchera de Pital, one of 110 member organisations of EDESA in Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan and with it she hopes to continue growing both personally and economically as well as actively participating in the communal bank of her community\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":873651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Underfunded

He is married and has three children. For the past 12 years he has been selling rugs, blankets, and other pieces of bed linen. Zafar is the sole provider for his family. In addition to his wife and children, his parents, brothers, and sisters also live with him. This means he must work a lot to support the family. Because of this he decided to take out a loan and use it to purchase a vehicle to use for transporting goods. This will help him develop the business. The loan will be repaid over 12 months. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva

She cultivates their land. Almost all of her life, she has had to work on the land. It is the only form of work that she knows. The farms are in areas that are at a very high altitude, where she has to wait for the rainy season, but now she plans to rent farms that are irrigated. What she like most about this work is to have very cultivated farms, without any weeds, so that she will have good yields. She has sown 2 sacks of beans and 20 sacks of potato seeds. Sometimes, cultivating her land does not supply her with enough. As a result, she also has to graze sheep. The prices of fertilizer have increased a lot, and when she can\u2019t buy it, she has to sell the mutton. Maria also works so that she can educate her young children, who are studying. The money that she is requesting is to spray her fields, so that she can harvest her crops and bring them to the market. She hopes the prices in the market will stay the same until the day that she harvests, so that can sow more, even though she has to rent land. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":215203,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To spray her fields for cultivation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-22T12:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-05T15:23:22Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":76.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957443},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":76.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227693},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":76.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422928},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":76.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116152},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:42:21Z","rounded_local_amount":76.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011112},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:13Z","rounded_local_amount":76.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594716},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:06Z","rounded_local_amount":76.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989242},{"amount":25,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":76.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210575}],"funded_date":"2008-10-22T14:23:22Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":74355,"name":"Roger Augusto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Roger M\u00fajica es productor joven ya que a su corta edad mantiene solo a toda su familia.

She and her children live in her late husband\u2019s house in the Bougoufi\u00e9 district of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of Mali).  She dropped out of school in the 9th basic year (education system in Mali) to get married by parental requirements.  She started a business following the death of her husband and sold cakes.  This business enabled her to understand the rules of commerce and to find out about marketing her merchandise.  After selling cakes, it was \r\ngarlic and shallots that she sold for seventeen years at the Chateau marketplace.  She is very well known in this niche and enjoys great distinction for the quality of her goods.  \r\n<p>\r\nWanting to obtain more merchandise in order to realize a lot of profit, she has turned to the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, with which she has been associated for 36 months.  After two solidarity loans, and two individual loans, all repaid, she is now on her third individual loan in the amount of 250,000 francs CFA.  She intends to use this loan to buy three sacks of garlic and three sacks of shallots.  Supplies are gotten from Burkina Faso.  She sells at the retail level to customers composed of men and women, cash or credit accepted.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 60,000 francs CFA that will serve to cover family expenses (to buy food and clothing for the children and to pay the schooling costs).  Her ambition is to transform her house from adobe to something hard.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She is 49 years old. Gloria is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI\/Kiva. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Gloria A.'s group.\r\n\r\nGloria is married and has 2 school-aged children. She owns and operates a business raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Gloria has been involved in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 3,000 PHP when she sells an animal.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Gloria joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gloria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI, which was used to purchase livestock to raise and eventually sell. Gloria is requesting a new loan, her third, of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Their community is a <i>Batey<\/i>, where most of the people live without services and where it is necessary to go to a closer city to get everything they want. \r\n\r\nCleotilde told us that with a loan from Kiva's partner, Esperanza International, many families, especially hers, have been able to improve their lives and to have hope.\r\n\r\nCleotilde's excited to be taking her second loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has been running her business for two years. She started investing in calling cards when many people bought prepaid cellphones because they need to buy calling cards to recharge their mobile credits. She will use this loan to buy calling cards and clothing. Cleotilde's dreams are to have an improved business and to take care of her family in a safe and beautiful house.

His partner in life works on her own.  His goals are to increase his business now that he is focused in the progress of his business.  He hopes to get another urban route to secure the future of his children and wife so that, one day, his children can be in charge of the business and will have the experience necessary to manage all of the situations that present themselves.  He dreams to expand his transportation services so that he has a larger clientele and to support his family since this could be one of the ways for his income to cover the household expenses.  <p>  \r\n\r\nHe is a transportation provider offering his services as a street vendor.  He has had this business for 4 years.  Don Francisco started this business with a used vehicle.  He started using this vehicle once he had all of his papers in order and completed the process to allow his vehicle to travel throughout the streets.  It has not been easy to do.  To acquire this vehicle, Don Francisco had to ask his family for a loan and, with his earnings, he has been able to pay back the debt little by little.  He thanks God for having decent and humble work to support his family.  The loan is for business capital since he needs the services of a mechanic to repair certain parts of his vehicle.  Now that he travels in rural areas it is necessary to constantly check the vehicle to ensure the safety of his customers.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joanna Silverman, Kiva

She is married and has four children, who are between the ages of 16 and 28 years old. She has been running a charcoal business since 2003. <P>\r\n\r\nCharcoal is used by many Tanzanians as fuel to cook their daily meals. Women cook food in small coal pots by arranging mkaa (charcoal), and then adding paper, dry grass, old plastic bags, or kerosene in order to light them. <P>\r\n\r\nBecause there is such a high demand for charcoal across the country, being a charcoal seller is quite lucrative. Kurusumu works at the business for 9 hours per day, 6 days per week, and is assisted by one employee. She currently earns about $200 USD per month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD in order to purchase more charcoal for resale. In the future, she plans to open another business. Kurusumu thanks you for her support! <P>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

These problems made life very difficult for him. It was a great hardship for him to sponsor his five children in school until the year 2000 when he saw GHAPE as a source of relief and became a member.\r\n\r\nHe is convinced that his business will succeed because of his business experience. He is well known in the community.

With these benefits, he will enjoy a better and more comfortable life. He prefers a loan from GHAPE because it includes training before the loan is disbursed and proper follow-up to ensure proper use of the loan. Also, the method of repayment is convenient and comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.

Janete thanks God that her life has meaning after the circumstances that she had to endure.  After her mother died, she was raised by her grandfather but he also passed away much later.  An aunt helped to support her since her father had abandoned the family.  \r\n<p>\r\nJanete lives in the neighborhood of Pablo \u00dabeda.  Her plans include being able to finish securing her house.  For this reason, she is requesting a loan to purchase stone, cement, sand, and iron to build a security wall behind her house.  This will provide safer conditions since there is frequent crime in her neighborhood due to high unemployment throughout the country.  She thanks the Institution for the opportunity to make these improvements to her home and providing an easy way for her to make her loan payments. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

He lives with his mother and three younger siblings. For the last four years he has been working as a mechanic, and with his income he helps support the family and provide them with a decent standard of living.\r\n\r\nBecause of his excellent work, Javier has many customers who regularly need his services. Recently he was given the opportunity to start his own small business at the entrance to the city. Up till now he has worked out of his house and didn't have anywhere to meet his customers. He had to take the vehicles to other places to mend them, entailing extra expenses.\r\n\r\nA friend has offered to rent him a place where he can do everything on site. That means that Javier now has to equip the workshop with tools for all kinds of vehicles, so he has approached Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan. He wants to buy the most widely used tools, but is also thinking of buying special tools for less common vehicles.\r\n\r\nJavier works every day except Sundays when he goes to church as he is strong Christian. Because of his beliefs he is very responsible and honest. The loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo will enable him to have a greater number of customers and thus increase his income. He will be able to expand his workshop and help his siblings and mother get ahead.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":884086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto

This is Kulsoom and her team: Elvin (to her left) and Fabrice (to her right). \n\nKulsoom is in charge of Juhudi Labs, an adventurous entity within Juhudi Kilimo, dedicated to discovering, testing and scaling new financial and agricultural products, services and processes. Fabrice is a marketing associate and Elvin is the Kiva Coordinator. They both work with Kulsoom on various development projects.\n\nThe 3 of them believe that success is in rallying coalitions of partners and mobilizing resources to lift smallholder farmers out of extreme poverty by broadening their access to education and financial inclusion. They are concerned that emerging challenges in Kenya such as climate change, conflict, and volatility of commodity prices threaten to erode decades of fragile gains in development we have made. It is for this reason that they have partnered with the following 3 start-up companies to make a difference:\n\n1. Future Pump.\n2. Ojay Greene\n3. F3 Life\n\nThey are seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to pay for 3 video productions that will feature the business profiles for each of the 3 start-ups. The video will give the start-up ventures a great milestone in terms of material for fundraising and marketing, which is necessary for them if they are to meet their business objectives of forming strategic partnerships and creating brand awareness.\n\nFuture Pump is a company that produces a solar-powered water pump (called a Sunflower pump) for use in irrigation. The Sunflower pump is a low-cost pump intended to pump fresh water from underground reservoirs for irrigating farmland. A single pump can use solar energy to lift 13,000 litres per day, enough to irrigate an average small-scale farm.\n\nOjay Greene Ltd produces and aggregates fresh produce from local farmers to sell to regional urban supermarkets. The company also provides smallholder farmers with consultation services that touch on food production, marketing, and training packages to enable them to adopt sustainable agricultural techniques in order to produce high-quality produce to supply to urban supermarkets.\n\nF3 Life provides training, on-site technical farming advice and credit to smallholder farmers to promote profitable, sustainable, and climate-resilient farming in the important watershed areas of Kenya. F3 Life\u2019s credit facility has a \u2018credit ladder\u2019 which allows clients to build a credit history, demonstrate cash flows, and build collateral to enable them to secure loans from formal financial institutions. Further, loan terms include requirements for soil and water conservation measures to prevent soil erosion.\n\nYour loan will help Kulsoom, Elvin and Fabrice pay for the production of professional videos about these start-ups. They shall help the ventures to utilize the videos to unlock new opportunities in education, funding, and strategic partnerships in order to scale their business and impact various areas such as:\n\n1. Boosting Agricultural Productivity and livelihoods in Kenya\nKenya has an 82% dependency ratio. 75% of the Kenyan workforce is dependent on agriculture for a living, the majority working on small farms. There is a huge deficit in basic skills and access to finances, meaning that yields and income are far below the potential.\n\n2. Expanding access to energy\nClean renewable energy programs that Juhudi Kilimo has rolled out have had a transformative effect on poor people\u2019s lives. They have provided lighting, clean cooking, and phone charging. Future Pump focuses on income-generating opportunities such as irrigation. They are targeting rural smallholder farmers who live in off-the-grid zones and rely on solid fuels to meet their daily needs.\n\n3. Improving financial inclusion\nRural smallholder farmers in Kenya have little or no access to formal financial services. They are unable to put their meager and unpredictable incomes into bank accounts and are therefore unable to save or take loans. Lack of credit keeps them from purchasing essential goods and services.\n\nThe partnership with the start-ups seeks to take full advantage of the explosion of the mobile phone market in Kenya by seizing an opportunity to use innovative, mobile-based solutions to provide inclusive, branchless financial services to rural farmers. We see mobile phones as a way of facilitating low-margin, high-volume business, as well as dramatically increasing the reach.\n\n4. Increasing access to education\nEducation is the cornerstone of poverty reduction. Education leads to many other development benefits besides improving income.

She also has a stall on Isaac Tamayo Street in La Paz, where she sells hats by the dozen every morning. This is one of the city\u2019s streets that gets a lot of traffic and is dominated by the informal sector. Her hat production is by the dozen, since she sells in bulk to her buyers, who then sell the hats individually; through her business, she indirectly generates several jobs. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is the fifth loan Ernestina has obtained through IMPRO. Her history with our institution qualifies her as a Level 1 client, that is to say, Very Good in payment of her obligation.

SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback
