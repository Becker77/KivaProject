She currently keeps 12 calves, 6 cows, 45 sheep and 20 hens.<br \/><br \/>Nelli produces cheese and sour cream and sells it in nearby markets. She works day and night to manage her work in the household, and her children are her only support. <br \/><br \/>Nelli ask lenders to support her with this loan enabling her to purchase fertilizer, seeds, fuel for land cultivation and forage for feeding the livestock.  Lack of access to loan products, bad market conditions and high costs creates a number of difficulties for people trying to develop their businesses in the Shirak region. <br \/><br \/>Nelli's loan has been approved through the joint initiative between SEF and Kiva, which provides loans to the underserved population of the Shirak region, in order to help them to gain market access and earn a living.

He lives with his father and brother and together with them is involved in farming. Their farm currently includes 6 piglets and  25 hens. They also cultivate beans, corn and potato and sell the gathered harvest in nearby markets. Agriculture is very important source of income for Narek and his family, and that's the reason they work hard to develop it. Narek asks this loan to purchase a sow and forage for feeding the livestock. <br \/><br \/>Narek has taken a loan from a financial institution before, but because of the family's poor conditions at that time, he wasn't able to pay it back. However, over these years of tireless work, Narek was able to develop his farm, which is profitable enough to cover monthly payments. <br \/>Narek has now been approved for a loan within the framework of a new joint initiative between Kiva and SEF International. The second-chance loan program provides loans to people who have bad credit history behind them and have no access to credit products.

Such foods are egg chicks and it's probably due to their favorable price plus their undeniable delicious taste that Filipinos favor them. Having then the opportunity to sell such foods, Marlyn, 43, who is a very hard-working entrepreneur from Intramuros, Manila, Philippines, engaged herself in this business. Together with her husband, Rodrigo, their income from the business is helping with their everyday needs and expenditures. Aside from this business, Marlyn also supervises an e-load business as seen in the picture above. <br \/><br \/>Marlyn buys bulks of balot and penoy (kinds of street foods) from her suppliers and then sells them in the market or distributes them by night. Her store is located in Baseco, Manila. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. <br \/><br \/>Marlyn is requesting an PHP 8,000 loan to purchase more stock of balot and penoy to sell. She will use her loan to improve her sales and her additional revenue to improve the general living conditions of her family.<br \/><br \/>In the future, she hopes to expand soon. Marlyn meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and there she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

This is considered one of the most common businesses built by ordinary people since it provides commodities for people. <br \/><br \/>Because of this fact, Elsie was enticed to get in touch with this kind of craft.

The income they get from the store helps them with their daily expenditures. <br \/><br \/>However, whatever profit they get from the business is sometimes insufficient. At times, Elsie finds it hard to maintain supplies of various products due to financial incapability. This is why she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan that she will utilize to buy additional products for her inventory. With more products displayed in her store, she can ably have a greater increase in her income. <br \/><br \/>In due time, she hopes that she will grow in progress and that her sales will increase.
