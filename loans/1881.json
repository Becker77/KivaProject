She is from Malibay, Pasay City, and is 62 years of age.  \r\n\r\nTo improve her profit and to pay for the maintenance of the boarding house, Margarita would like to ask for another loan. An amount of PHP 50,000 would help her in the renovation and beautification of these buildings, so that her regular boarders will choose to stay there for a longer period of time. She will also use a portion of the loan to buy more inventory for her sari-sari store business. She sincerely wants to let you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance, in advance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Margarita hopes that she will attract more boarders. She also desires to start up another business, for additional income.\r\n\r\nMargarita meets with her co-fellowship members* every week, to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Sari-sari means \"variety\". Since then, they provide the people with products mostly needed in everyday survival- from products for personal hygiene such as shampoo, toothpaste, powder; to condiments, foods, canned goods and other stuff at merely low-cost. This is why many of those who want to start a business often start with being Sari-sari vendors because in just a small capital, you can automatically operate a store and earn money.\n\nHere is Amanda, 56 years old from Pasay City, Metro Manila. She began being involved in this kind of business 10 years ago. And through all those years, she was able to provide her children a living through the income she gets from the store. What she does is basically buy supplies in large quantity and then displays them at her store and sells them in retail, often for a price that is much more affordable for people but is larger than the original price so she can have a profit.\n\nHowever, you cannot expect a regular and stable income from this since sales vary from time to time. For this reason, Amanda wants to ask you for a PHP 20,000 loan that she will use to buy more supplies of products to display in her store. Certainly, this will really help her improve her business and attract more customers.\n\nShe meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.\n\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

It is mostly a convenience store, but smaller than the usual, and it offers only limited products that are commonly needed, such as toiletries, food, instants, beverages and other commodities. Unlike grocery stores, sari-sari stores offer products at low cost and on a retail basis, which is really an advantage for the customers.<br \/><br \/>Flordeliza had found ways to further improve her sales previously, and one of those is to have a loan from Kiva. It was a very good opportunity, and she was able to fully repay it.<br \/><br \/>Now, she would like to ask help from you again. She would like to borrow a loan of PHP 25,000, which she would use to purchase additional products and merchandise items for her store. With this, she expects to grow her sales and provide a better remedy for her family\u2019s daily living condition.

She has been operating the business for almost 15 years now. She has four kids and is married to Wilfredo. Whatever income she gets basically from her chosen trade; she uses it for helping her husband in sustaining the family expenses. <br \/><br \/>Filipinos are fond of eating heavy meals. Unlike some foreign countries that are only used to eating breads for lunch or dinner, most Filipinos can\u2019t afford to not eat rice with dishes during lunches and dinners. And it is a big help to most when there are food stalls along the roads where they can eat without even going home to just merely cook. This is the reason why perhaps Sarah has chosen to manage a food stall then. Since food is always in demand, she earns good profit from this. <br \/><br \/>However, Sarah still wants to expand her business, though she had already availed herself of a loan from Kiva previously, which was used for business purposes also. She is asking for a loan worth PHP 10,000 now. She will use this to buy more quantity of raw ingredients needed for her recipes. She wants to give to you her sincerest thanks for your goodness and generosity by now. <br \/><br \/>In the future, she wants her family to experience progress and improve, as well in her current business. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

This loan will allow Edith and her family to maintain their current standard of living until proceeds from the harvest arrive. With the pre-harvest funds, Edith will be able to pay her children's school fees and provide family support until her crops are ready to sell.

She lives in Kulithalai in the state of Tamil Nadu. Her family is dependent on agriculture for sustenance and they make do with their monthly household income of Rs. 9,000.<br \/><br \/>The sanitation crisis in India is a result of poor infrastructure and lack of education. This group of three (the women in the picture), led by Selvi, have understood the importance of having a toilet at home. But they do not have the means to build one. With no access to a toilet, Selvi and her family has to walk long distances to answer nature's call in private, in dense bushes or isolated fields. The women and girls, seeking privacy, often resort to waking up before sunrise to relieve themselves. Due to a lack of sanitation facilities, her family is at risk of contracting infections. They fall ill often, spending a significant portion of their savings on medical expenses each month.

He's requesting a loan to cover his educational expenses. This is his history:<br \/><br \/>\"My name is Juan Miguel. I am 17 years old and I live in Santiago de los Caballeros.  I have two younger siblings and I live with my parents.  My father's a cobbler and my mother's a teacher.<br \/><br \/>\"I would like to attend college at UTESA, the Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Santiago.  I have had a passion for medicine from a very young age, so it's the field I want to study.  I feel I can become a very good doctor.  This is the first time I have planned to enroll in a university, so it would be the start of my program.<br \/><br \/>\"This loan is very important to me because whether I can start studying the field I so want to depends on it.  If I didn't get the loan I would keep on trying until I succeeded, because going to college depends on it.  It would also affect me a lot because my parents don't have the necessary money to pay for my college education, because in our society it's very expensive to satisfy all of a family's needs and especially for education.  Also, if I didn't get this loan my dreams would be put on hold because I'd have to look for a way to work and go to school, and doing both things I would devote less time to my studies, making my dream of being a medical professional a long-term goal.<br \/><br \/>\"My academic goals are: to become an excellent doctor; to help my parents, who have worked so hard to get my siblings and me ahead; and to help them achieve my siblings' dreams just as I want to achieve mine, with God's help.<br \/><br \/>\"When I finish my program I want to specialize in plastic surgery.  My favorite field of medicine is plastic surgery, which I have always seen as a way to help more needy people who need this

Ever since her husband died, she dedicated herself to raising her children, and she is thankful to God that they now have their own families. Being a widow has been her biggest challenge in life, but with her faith and perseverance she came out of it victorious. She is now enjoying the presence of her grandchildren.\r\n\r\nMiguela has been blessed with a small general store for 10 years already. She sells dry and packaged commodities directly to consumers. Almost all of these products are essential food and household items. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from her first customers since she started her store, it is now serving more as the population grew in her community. \r\n\r\nTo help her sustain and grow her store, she is seeking a PHP 30,000 loan to fill her small store with more food items such as rice, frozen foods, biscuits, canned good, instant noodles, eggs, etc. so she can compete well with other general stores nearby. Although she sometimes encounters difficulty in collecting receivables from some of her customers, she maintains the positive outlook that God will supply all their needs.\r\n\r\nMiguela's precious dream is to see her grandchildren grow up and finish their studies. She always prays for a good and loving family.

Working people who want to earn extra money usually engage in this business also. It\u2019s easy to venture into the direct selling business since it typically requires low capital to begin with. Then the entrepreneur or direct-selling representative will just enhance the business by expanding her network of target customers and proper rolling of capital.<br \/><br \/>Milagros of Tigbauan, Iloilo is a direct selling representative who sells products from notable companies such as Avon, Personal Collection and Beautiful Horizon. She is married to Edgardo and they have children who are already raising their own families. <br \/><br \/>Milagros still aspires to improve her business because it\u2019s her desire to extend help to her grandchildren. Indeed, the responsibilities of a loving mother\/grandmother don\u2019t cease. With the aid of additional capital amounting to PhP 10,000, Milagros will buy more personal and home products, including clothes, shoes and bags. She\u2019s positive that this additional capital will give her more profit to support her grandchildren. Her dream is to have a stable space or a showroom for her business someday.

They are survivors of Typhoon Haiyan that swept the Philippines, especially the Visayas region in November 2013. Oscar runs a \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store in Tigbauan, Iloilo and he continues to work hard in order to maintain and improve it. However, the income derived from his store varies from time to time as it is usually affected by the competition within the area. Aside from this, he has some neighbors who have the habit of paying later for those items they get. Sometimes it takes few days or weeks before they pay. The stability of his business is shaken by this practice because it depletes his capital. <br \/><br \/>He is a considerate person who cannot refuse his neighbors, but he also has to earn enough money for their everyday needs and save some amount for their retirement. Self-employed citizens in the Philippines, especially in some remote areas, have no pension or medical benefits when they retire. They have to rely on their own savings or help from other people. Considering this, Oscar needs to improve his business. <br \/><br \/>He plans to buy more supplies, particularly soft drinks, beverages, and grocery items. He is requesting additional capital of PHP 30,000 that will surely boost his income and savings. He\u2019s praying for your generous support and wishes for more blessings to come your way.

Maria is asking for a new loan in order to fulfill the increased demand, but also to generate more income and be able to buy high quality fabric, as well as high quality multi-colored threads. Maria\u2019s goal is to be able to hire more women to help them all move out of a state of poverty and become strong and empowered like she is. She knows that this will be of great benefit to them and their community. <br \/><br \/>Each month, Maria and her friends in the Trust Bank attend their Trust Bank meeting and after transacting business on their loans, they participate in games and role-playing on a particular useful subject. Maria and the ladies in the \u201cFlor de Chapol\u201d Trust Bank thank KIVA investors from throughout the world for their support and generosity.

Profit from her business partially sustains her family\u2019s expenses, but her children\u2019s education is still a big problem. Also her husband\u2019s brother asked for financial assistance just recently, and they extended help to the extent of sacrificing their everyday sustenance. <br \/><br \/>She desires to gain more profit so she can save better and efficiently prepare for her children\u2019s educational needs. To improve her business, she asks for a PHP 10,000 loan, which she will use to buy stocks of items to sell in her variety store. She also sets aside some savings to buy a refrigerator so she can sell soft drinks and other beverages. In the long run, she hopes to renovate her house and build a bigger structure for her store.<br \/><br \/>Mary Jane meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Daniel as other members of the share-land works daily in the cornfield and he earns the minimum Mexican Salary (around 120 USD per month). A year ago Daniel spent around 9 USD per month in buying candles, which he and his family used as light source. Candles were a deficient light source and breathing the candle smoke had repercussions on Daniel's family' health. To improve their life conditions, the Mexican government gave some of the residents of El Encanto solar systems to have light in the night and to stop consuming harmful light sources.

Customers will be able to collect BrightBox systems immediately and pay for them upfront or over several months. Since they are currently spending money on polluting, unsafe, and inefficient energy, most will save enough to recoup costs in 4 to 5 months and never worry about fuel or fire again. <br \/><br \/>Audrey's long-term goal is to continue to receive inventory from One Degree Solar and be a consistent re-seller of BrightBox.

She had a very friendly and happy family, but unfortunately, after several years of marriage, her husband died. She was left alone with two children. After her husband died, everything fell on her head. She could barely cope with maintaining the family. It was very difficult for her: her heart was broken, and her life seemed cruel. But over the years she has pulled herself together, and now lives for the sake of their two lively children. Now Zebo is working in a high school and in animal husbandry. After a hard day's work, she comes home and takes care of the livestock.  She barely earns enough to support her children. She is having a very hard time because she does not have a degree, so she can be fired from her job, and the money she earns from livestock is not enough to feed her family. She decided to pursue higher education. She wants to go to the university. Therefore, she asked Arvand for a loan to pay tuition and thanks you in advance for your

She is 23 years old. She is married but has no children yet. Since childhood Shahnoza wanted to learn sewing from her mother. She likes to embroider beautiful dresses and to come up with new styles. As she matured, her mother taught her to embroider. Now, she is a famous seamstress in her village, and her mother is very proud of her. A couple of years later, Shahnoza married and now lives with her husband. They have a very big family. Her husband saw that she really wants to be a seamstress . She decided to buy a sewing machine. Since her husband is a construction worker and they had a large family, his salary will not cover the expense, so together they decided to get a loan from Arvand. In the future, Shahnoza is sure she will be a very famous seamstress, not only in her village, but in the city. She and her husband thank you and Arvand in advance for your support!!!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":24.03,"image":{"id":1954690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buy a sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Panjakent","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-09-01T00:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-01T00:20:03Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shahnoza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":65.71},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":71.58},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":72},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":74.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":78.29},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":78.82},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":85.27},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":87},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":90.12},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":96.69},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":106.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.53},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":12.6},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.07},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.7},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.79},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.92},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.23},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.77},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.27},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.92},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":11.5,"local_amount":65.71,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":72.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731040510},{"amount":12.53,"local_amount":71.58,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":79.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755520183}],"funded_date":"2015-09-01T03:38:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":940326,"name":"Joed","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joed wants to be prepared for the next cropping period.

Shirinoy has been breeding cattle for eight years. She buys them young, fattens them a few months, then sells them for a higher price. Her business is the main source of income for her family. Because of her business, her family does not want for anything. Shirinoy wants her children to be able to get a decent education and work in their specialty, and not live in torment like their parents. At the moment, Shirinoy is having problems with her business. She cannot sell livestock due to the low prices. She needs to buy food for livestock. So, because of this problem, she decided to apply to Arvand for financial support. With the money, she wants to purchase livestock feed and at the same time take advantage of the prices to buy young cattle at a low price."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1954612,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

For this reason, she wishes to continue investing in her academic growth requesting a loan in order to write off her whole English course; to buy instructional materials, such as books; and a portable computer, since she wants to profile not as one of the best students, but as the best student in her course and complete her course of study with honors.  Her plans are to get in a post-graduate program and then get a Master's degree."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":137.92,"image":{"id":1967626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education
