She is 50 years old and married to Pepito, a laborer.  They have two children, one of whom is a college student. Her husband\u2019s irregular income cannot support their growing expenses, so she has ventured into directly selling Personal Collection products.\r\n \r\nDirect selling businesses are common in the Philippines, especially for housewives who want to be productive and are willing to supplement the lack of family resources. Working people who want to earn extra money usually engage in this business also.  It\u2019s easy to venture into this business since it typically requires low capital to begin. Then the entrepreneur or direct selling representative will grow the business by expanding her network of target consumers and properly rolling the capital.\r\n\r\nVirginia aspires to enhance her direct selling business. She applied for PhP 20,000 loan that she will use to buy more personal and home care products.  She\u2019s positive that this additional capital will give her more profit to supplement her husband\u2019s income. \r\n\r\nShe dreams to build her family\u2019s house someday. She also desires for a good future for her children and a harmonious relationship among her family. She meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":187.5,"image":{"id":1967658,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more personal and home care products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Davao City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"7.073056 125.612778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-09-01T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-01T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":833.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":4999.98,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:36:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5265,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955524},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3333.32,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:14:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3510,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045369}],"funded_date":"2015-09-25T02:17:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jay Wiley","image":1027628}},{"id":940354,"name":"Malia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Malia is a 32 year old mother with five children.

She buys a few head of livestock, feeds them for a few months and then resells them at the cattle market.  She has requested a loan in order to buy a few head of livestock and increase the size of her herd. She hopes that this business expansion will lead to an increase in her income, which will in turn allow her to improve her children's living conditions.

She grew up alongside her parents, with her father cultivating corn and beans while she and her mother worked weaving bed rolls all day. From this work they earned an income to help support the family.  <br \/><br \/>Tomasa has never stopped weaving bed rolls, and like her, some of her daughters also make them. They buy the reeds and cut strips from the stalk of the plant, so they can then start weaving, a task that must be done on the floor.

She is 32 years old. She is married and has four children. She lives in a small rural village. Since childhood, she dreamed of becoming a teacher, but because of financial difficulties, she could not get a higher education. Immediately after graduating from high school Mukaddam was married. And so she became a housewife. But even while staying at home, Mukaddam never sits idle. She and her husband are trying to do everything possible to support their children with everything they need. <br \/>,<br \/>In order to have a steady income to feed the family, Mukaddam and her \u200b\u200bhusband started their own business. They work in animal husbandry. Mukaddam raises livestock and then sells the meat and milk. Mukaddam makes a good income from this. Mukaddam's husband also works in a local workshop and his work brings additional income to the family. Their joint income is enough to live, and they have enough funds to cover all their needs. Currently, Mukaddam and her husband want to buy a few head of cattle for fattening. So, she turned to Arvand and wants to take a loan to buy cattle. Mukaddam thanks you and Arvand in advance for your support, which0 will improve the quality of life for her

is in the Central region of Kenya. This 30-year-old farmer started in 2012 with a dairy cow and poultry for milk and eggs. Today, she has also ventured into crop farming, both for sale and for consumption. She sells her produce at Nkubu, which is one of the fastest growing towns in Africa. <br \/><br \/>Dorcas is seeking a loan to increase her banana farming. Growing bananas does not require much effort, but to achieve high yields requires skills, dedication, and proper planting methods. Dorcas, who has three children, feels she is cut out for it.

Gladys has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. Although she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up; \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. Gladys mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Gladys is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge, hence she has suffered so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if they are to fetch a high price and through this loan, Gladys is going to achieve her dream and goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle but Gladys feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help out women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. <br \/><br \/>Support an entrepreneur whose dream is to give an excellent quality of life to her family. This support will not only benefit Gladys, but will also help create full time employment for someone because she intends to employ someone to help with the farm work and ride the motorbike."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":81.07,"image":{"id":1961553,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike to transport her produce to the market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-09-01T06:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-01T06:20:05Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2016-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2016-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2016-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2016-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.39},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.42},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.58},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.71},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.87},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.06},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.29},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.56},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.86},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.2},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.1,"local_amount":4610.33,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4767.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024278},{"amount":34.97,"local_amount":3496.62,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3615.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112312}],"funded_date":"2015-09-22T19:55:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":940442,"name":"Estrellas Del Gran Poder Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cESTRELLAS DEL GRAN PODER\u201d iniciar\u00e1 el primer ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro Focal de Collpani, est\u00e1 compuesta por ocho  integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva donde la se\u00f1ora Natalia  es la Presidenta.

She has a high school education and is a very kindhearted, responsible and purposeful woman. She currently isn't working but has great experience in entrepreneurship, as she and her husband ran a cafeteria in their home region for more than 10 years, where they had regular clients and good income. However, during the events of 2011 she and her family had to close their business and move to the city of Bishkek, leaving behind their relatives and their home.\r\n\r\nAfter a break, Gulnara has decided to start another business. She found out that good loans for start-up businesses are available through Bai Tushum Bank. She has taken a course in financial literacy, done the math and valued her future business. She has also already acquired shelves for her shop, looked through ads and researched the standard prices for containers, and found a place not far from her home where she could open a shop. Having done the calculations, Gulnara figured out that she needs a loan of 150,000 KGS, which will allow her to purchase a container. She has long dreamed of opening her own business and therefore has saved some money and will use these savings to purchase refrigerators, scales and food products for sale.\r\n\r\nGulnara and her family's current combined income is about 8,600 KGS, made up of her husband's pension and her son's salary - her son, by the way, is quite the achiever and not only studies at the university, but also works part-time in a clinic and earns a salary of about 5,000 KGS.He helps where he can both financially and around the house but it's not a lot of money and Gulnara wants to be independent and turn things around so she can help her son. Therefore she has decided to start her own business.

It\u2019s quite challenging to provide for their everyday food, given their usual needs such as clothes and shoes, and pay for their educational expenses. But Alicia, 52, is trying her best with the help of her carpenter husband, Romeo, and with the aid of her vegetable vending and hog-raising business. They also own a piece of land where they plant and harvest some crops. This is a good source of alternative income. As of now, two of her children are already working and six are still studying. She doesn\u2019t consider her big family as a burden; instead she sees them as companions in her life journey.<br \/><br \/>When Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines, especially the Visayas region, in November 2013, Alicia\u2019s vegetable vending business suffered a lot due to damaged farmlands, trees and crops. With the help of her family, they were able to \u201cbuild back better\u201d her enterprise. Now she\u2019s aiming to add more vegetable produce and buy fertilizer for their farm. She also plans to buy additional piglets to raise. <br \/><br \/>A loan worth PhP 30,000 would be very helpful to procure all these.

They joined together as a solidarity group three years ago in order to receive loans through Pana Pana.

She has a lot of collectibles from her neighbors in Tigbauan, Iloilo. Many of her debtors pay after several weeks or months and she cannot force them because there are times when money is really difficult to earn. <br \/><br \/>It\u2019s a good thing that she has an alternative source of income which is her farm being nurtured by her husband, Eduardo. They have five children, two of whom are already working. Their combined income somehow sustains their everyday needs and educational expenses of her three younger children. But she still aims to improve her variety store so it can earn enough to lighten their financial burden. A PhP 10,000 loan would be very helpful for her to buy additional grocery items, beverages and few sacks of rice to enhance her inventory. You can be the answer to her prayers through your generous support.

They can pay per hour or per minute of internet use and they can connect with their social network. Cherry, 35, knows this need. That\u2019s why she decided to open an internet caf\u00e9 called Piso Net beside her house in Buhangin, Davao City. Piso Net is a coin-operated internet PC with a typical rental fee of 1 PHP every four minutes. It is a budget-friendly internet caf\u00e9 suitable for short-time internet users. She can help those students who need to research their school assignments, those families with members abroad who long to see each other through Skype, and also those bored individuals who want to play online games. <br \/><br \/>But no matter how in demand Cherry\u2019s business is, she will experience loss if she does not give importance to its maintenance. As of now, she needs 29,000 PHP to pay for the checking, upgrading, and maintenance of her computers. She will also buy another computer unit to accommodate more customers. In due time, she hopes to open another branch of Piso Net to double her income. <br \/><br \/>She\u2019s single but she\u2019s a responsible sister who supports her sibling\u2019s college expenses. <br \/><br \/>She is a compliant member of CCT Credit Cooperative and meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to inspire and strengthen each other through the Word of God. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Vitaliano. Having a bigger responsibility requires more effort to provide for their needs, especially for her children. Annabel and her husband have to work hard, with the determination of having more income than they currently have, so they can provide their children with a better education. <br \/><br \/>To improve her profit and to pay for the maintenance of the boarding house, Annabel would like to ask for loan assistance. An amount of PHP 15,000 could help her in the renovation and beautification of their place, so that her regular boarders will choose to stay there for a longer period of time. She will also use a portion of the loan to add up to the capital needed for her canteen business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance, in advance.<br \/><br \/>In the future, Annabel hopes that they can attract more boarders.

That\u2019s why Lilia is always focused on handling the business and marketing strategies to attract customers. With the help of the Lord, Lilia\u2019s greatest foundation, the business is able to survive on a daily basis. She is hopeful that CCT will grant the loan request of PHP 30,000.
