","en":"Latofat is a 41-year-old woman who lives in a rural area. She has a large and close-knit family. Latofat has been raising cattle and small livestock since an early age. Her father was a farmer and she used to help him take care of the livestock. Slowly she started raising livestock on her own. After getting married, Latofat did not stop her activities\u2014on the contrary, she increased her herd, as her husband fully supported her business.

While many people find them as useless, Josefina, 58 years old, still finds them as a way to generate a living. <br \/><br \/>Since, trash is not well-managed in the country and just thrown anywhere along the sidewalks and riverbanks, street dwellers usually collect such things that are still recyclable from junk like copper, papers, plastics and metals. After collecting, their next destination is to the junk shop where they sell such for a corresponding price depending on the material. Usually, metals cost higher. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries and factories. <br \/><br \/>However, stable income from this kind of business is hardly predictable. Sometimes, the revolving fund that the Junk Shop operators use is not enough. This is why Josefina is taking out a loan worth PHP 15,000 to add up for her current revolving fund and to use for improving the shop. <br \/><br \/>With her husband Jimmy, they are truly hopeful that someday their lives will get better and they will be able to renovate their house.

He lives with his wife and three children in his own house in a small village called Yakhtan.  He has a secondary education and he has been involved in fattening cattle literally since childhood.  He now works in animal husbandry and agriculture.  Avaz is very dynamic and hardworking.  He currently owns two cows and four sheep.  He also makes extra money working as a handyman, an activity from which he derives a good salary.  His wife helps him around the farm; she sells the milk they get from their livestock.\r\n\r\nAvaz wants to increase the size of his herd and expand his business.  For this reason, he has turned to Kiva's field partner, MDO Arvand, to get a loan which will help him to buy a cow.  He is looking very forward to a positive outcome, and he thanks MDO Arvand in advance for their support.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":44.26,"image":{"id":1957361,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow.

","en":"Shohista, age 29, is a young woman who lives in a rural area.  She is married and the mother of two children.  She is involved in retail business at the local market and she sells sewing supplies.  With her mom's help, she got involved in this business right after she finished school.  Her mom taught her a lot; she showed her how to select and buy merchandise and how to interact with customers.  Gradually, Shohista was able to increase her merchandise turnover and her income.\r\n\r\nShohista's husband works as a taxi driver and, during his spare time, he also helps his wife with her own business.  Shohista's business constitutes the main source of income for the family.  At the moment, Shohista is experiencing some financial difficulties and she cannot buy merchandise.  For this reason, she has decided to turn to Kiva's field partner, MDO Arvand, for support.  She intends to use her loan to buy some merchandise."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":146.98,"image":{"id":1954600,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy sewing supplies and increase her turnover.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

She took longer than normal for her to finish her college due financial constraints. She then identified a talent in her of sewing in order for her to finance her studies.<br \/>Finally she managed to graduate in November 2014 but could not get a place of employment; in fact currently there has been a trend where most companies are retrenching. Having been used to finance her studies through part time tailoring, she endeavored to venture more and involve herself intensely in embroidery. <br \/><br \/>As soon as Christmas 2014, she started tailoring energetically and due to the experience she had, her final creation was state of the art designer work. Tailoring proved sustainable hence the need for expansion was inevitable. The only handicap for expansion was lack of financial injection, fortunately she was introduced to Thrive by a neighbor, the good news she had been waiting for all along. <br \/>She and her 4 group members of Kindergarten attended Thrive sessions. She indicated that she benefited a lot from Thrive sessions and that the sessions were motivational and cemented her resolution to expand her business. In her business she provides tailoring business to clients who bring their own materials. Her clients give her their designs and she works on the material according to their specific requirements. Of late African Prints fabrics are the new hot material in town hence her expansion is focusing on using that material on production of dresses, suits, coating shoes and also sewing on matching handbags. She also makes accessories like clutch bags, earrings, flat base caps, and belts in African print. She intends to penetrate to a wider market and her vision is to become reputable designer using Computer Aided Design (CAD).

They provide for their everyday needs and the educational expenses of their four children. <br \/><br \/>But because raising four children is really challenging, Gloria also ventures into hog raising to augment her income. She expands her business little by little towards her goal of completing her children\u2019s education and owning a grocery store someday. But it\u2019s a distant target yet. For now she aspires to buy more grocery items and beverages to widen the selection in her store. She applied for a PHP 15,000 loan for this purpose. Part of it will be utilized for feed and vitamins for her hogs. Hopefully, additional income from this will boost her savings for the future. <br \/><br \/>She draws encouragement from her co-fellowship* members who meet every week to share life stories and Bible reflections. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Fozilat has five children, and she has been able to support them thanks to animal husbandry, as it provides the primary source of income for her family. She began this work after her husband's death as a means to somehow support her children. She was able to incrementally increase her number of animals from two to five grown dairy cows. In addition Fozilat milks the cows and sells the milk at market. This is how she has supported her family all of this time. Currently Fozilat has come up against several financial issues due to a decrease in the price of animals. She wants to use the funds received to buy feed for her animals and a young cow for further fattening."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1943479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

She feels fortunate to have her whole family living with her, especially her grandson Leonardo, and being able to enjoy again all those special moments children give us. Maria Elena is building a new home, together with her husband and children, so they can all live together. <br \/><br \/>She is now asking for a credit to finish the floor of her house with tiles, and complete the plumbing of the housing. She works as a clerk at a local auditing office, but is paid by the hour with no social security. This makes her job informal and almost impossible to access credit. The additions she wants to make to the house will provide a safer and healthier environment for her grandson to live in.

Being familiar with the Newark area, Kris realized that there were many chefs, bakers, and caterers in the city who were looking for space to rent where they could cook their food. The problem was that there were no commercial kitchens or incubators that would support these entrepreneurs by renting out kitchen space.  <br \/><br \/>Sensing an opportunity, Kris left her job working at a non-profit to go to work in kitchens around the state to learn as much as she could about what it's like to run a kitchen incubator. She also enrolled in an entrepreneur training course to teach her the business management skills she needed to run a business of her own. Now, armed with the skills and potential customers, Kris is ready to open her own kitchen incubator to serve the entrepreneurs who need her help.  <br \/><br \/>This loan will help Kris with start-up costs like payments for her kitchen and equipment."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":3425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1968751,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to pay for start-up costs to get her kitchen incubator business running.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Newark","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":316,"posted_date":"2015-09-02T17:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-02T17:40:03Z","loan_amount":9975,"lender_count":99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":9975,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":9975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":358.96},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":363.45},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":367.99},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":372.59},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":377.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":381.97},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":386.74},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":391.57},{"due_date":"2016-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":396.47},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":401.42},{"due_date":"2016-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":406.44},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":411.52},{"due_date":"2016-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2016-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":421.88},{"due_date":"2016-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":427.15},{"due_date":"2016-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":432.49},{"due_date":"2017-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":437.89},{"due_date":"2017-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":443.37},{"due_date":"2017-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":448.91},{"due_date":"2017-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":454.52},{"due_date":"2017-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":460.2},{"due_date":"2017-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":465.96},{"due_date":"2017-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":471.78},{"due_date":"2017-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":477.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":358.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":363.45},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":367.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":372.59},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":377.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":381.97},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":386.74},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":391.57},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":396.47},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":401.42},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":406.44},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":411.52},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":421.88},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":427.15},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":432.49},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.89},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":443.37},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":448.91},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":454.52},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":460.2},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":465.96},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":471.78},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":477.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":940844,"name":"Richard","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Richard is a married man.

","en":"Orom is a 49-year-old woman living in a rural location. Orom has been rearing animals for ten years. She buys young cattle and, having fattened them, sells them for a higher price. Orom began rearing animals after she got married. Seeing that it was hard for her husband to provide for the family on his own, she decided to buy a couple of heads of cattle and sold them after having fattened them for a couple of months. She bought more cattle with the money she received and in this way she was gradually able to increase her herd. Orom's husband works as a builder on a private construction site and goes to Russia seasonally to earn money, but the money that he earns is insufficient to provide for all of the family's needs.\r\n\r\nAt the present time Orom's business is the main source of income for their family. Now Orom has some financial difficulties due to the fall in the price of cattle. She is not able to sell her mature cattle without losing some of her profit. She has decided to apply to Arvand for financial support with this problem. Orom wants to buy cattle feed and cattle with the money she will receive."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1966752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle feed and cattle for fattening and resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"J.

To date she has managed to create a good customer base which generates an acceptable income for her. Jennifer works daily from 8:00 a.m. until 6:00 visiting her customers. <br \/><br \/>She is convinced that with more money to invest she will be able to increase her clientele and sales, which is why she is working on her first Kiva loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She plans to invest these resources in clothing, shoes and perfumes; the products in greatest demand from her customers. <br \/><br \/>Her dream of prosperity is to establish her business in a commercial site, and over the long-term to buy her own apartment."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":18.6,"image":{"id":1968919,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to buy clothing, shoes and perfume.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-09-02T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-02T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yenifer Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":56855},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":78036},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":80182},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":82387},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":84652},{"due_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":86980},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":89372},{"due_date":"2016-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":91830},{"due_date":"2016-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":94355},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":96950},{"due_date":"2016-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":99616},{"due_date":"2016-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":128785}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.53},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.23},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.95},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.69},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.45},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.23},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.04},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.86},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.71},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.58},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":18.6,"local_amount":56855,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:24:17Z","rounded_local_amount":58652.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752082759}],"funded_date":"2015-10-02T15:52:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"K Fisher"}},{"id":941370,"name":"Rhoda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rhoda is a married woman who has three children, all of whom attend school.

Almost all businesses in those areas dwindled after the typhoon. Entrepreneurs worked hard in the past years to recover and rehabilitate their businesses. \u201cSari-sari\u201d or variety stores were not exempted to that crisis. Frequent distribution of relief goods to Haiyan affected communities almost crushed the variety stores, because the commodities that the people need everyday were supplied to them through relief goods. It was after several months after Haiyan when variety stores rose again. \n\nHeidi is one of those variety store owners. Not only Haiyan affected her business. Her income also diminishes during school breaks or vacations. Now that the store operation returns to normal, she needs more stock of grocery items, toiletries, and beverages. She implores your kind support to enable her to buy all these needs in the amount of PhP 15,000. May you be God\u2019s blessing to her as she aspires to improve her business.\n\nHeidi is married to Romeo, a laborer, and they have children who are the reason for their hard work. She prays for good health, love and unity among her family members.

This makes him different from other farmers, because he is rarely affected by weather changes, and two, he benefits so much from his crops because of his timing.
