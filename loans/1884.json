Those loans really helped sustain her laundry brush nets and send her children to school. Although her sales is not always good, she maintains her positive outlook in life that things will get better.<br \/><br \/>She is humbly asking again for a 19,000 PHP loan which she will use to pay for rolled fish nets, nylon thread and other materials to make more laundry brush nets to sell. <br \/><br \/>She is thanking God and you in advance for your good heart and continued support of her livelihood. Her earnings will surely help cover their daily sustenance and fund her children's education. <br \/><br \/>Lucy's simple dream is for her business to grow and see her two high school children go to college. She believes education is their hope and path to allow her children a better quality of life. Every week Lucy meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God which she studies.<br \/><br \/>* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":194.81,"image":{"id":1854028,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To pay for raw materials to make laundry brush nets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-09-02T20:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-02T20:10:04Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":791.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.7},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.7},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.7},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":123.97,"local_amount":5541.69,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:36:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5803.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955552},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":3166.68,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":3316.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045397}],"funded_date":"2015-09-04T20:28:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":941461,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David deals in growing and selling cocoa, which he has practiced for many years.

This is Florence. She is the Deputy Head Teacher of Serena School, a mixed school in the Rural area of Lweza in Wakiso with 120 students. Serena School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistently clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nSerena School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Florence ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve her students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":170,"image":{"id":1965131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Wakiso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-09-02T21:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-02T21:10:06Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Serena School","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3035000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":607000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":170,"local_amount":607000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:13:00Z","rounded_local_amount":623390,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755507294}],"funded_date":"2015-09-03T04:07:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michael Angelilli","image":1331534}},{"id":941487,"name":"Mwanasiti","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanasiti is a divorced mother of two children, both of whom attend school.

kind-hearted man with a positive attitude toward life.  He is married and he has three children.  He lives with his family in a small house in the countryside.  He has his own business, which helps him to support his family.  He works as a farmer and also raises livestock.  He has some land: part of his land is actually dry land, the rest is irrigated land.  On his irrigated land, Hamid grows carrots, potatoes and grains.  His wife helps him to take care and raise the livestock.\r\n\r\nHamid's animal husbandry business brings him a good income so, for this reason, he would like to increase his cattle headcount and expand his activity.  He has turned to Kiva's field partner, MDO Arvand, in order to get a loan to buy livestock.  He thanks them in advance for their support. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1960543,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy some livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahriston","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-09-02T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-02T22:50:03Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hamid","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":771.8},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":787.98},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":817.06},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":843.98},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":878.35},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":900.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.49},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.08},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.73},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.04},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.53},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":144.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":941510,"name":"Sokha's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sokha\u2019s Group lives in a rural village in Kampong Speu province, in Cambodia. <br \/><br \/>Sokha makes a living cultivating rice and she also does extra work as a factory laborer and a construction worker to support her family. <br \/><br \/>In their village, there is no reliable access to safe, clean, drinking water.

By profession, he is a Russian teacher and he currently works in a secondary school.  His daughter has just graduated from secondary school and she wants to go to university.  The family therefore needs to pay for her first-year tuition fees, but Azimjon doesn't have such a big sum of money to pay her whole tuition fee.

She is 26 years old and is in a common-law marriage with Cesar. They are the parents of a little girl who is about to start school at the end of August. Reyna, as she is lovingly called, earns a living making crafts such as napkins, embroidered handkerchiefs with ribbon, and knitted clothing. Since she was small, Reyna always showed interest in this type of occupation. \"I love to transform materials in order to decorate,\" she mentioned contently. Also, from the time she was 15 years old she began taking classes to further develop her abilities.<br \/><br \/>Four years ago, Reyna requested her first loan from VFMexico. This financing was vital in starting her business. With the money she received she bought string, yarn, needles, ribbon and other materials. Reyna's house is where she lets her creativity free and where the transformation occurs. Her customers already know her and come to her house to buy pieces or make special orders for specific types of events.<br \/><br \/>Reyna appears very proud of her accomplishments. Over time she has gained experience that helps her to make a large variety of crafts in less time. She is also very grateful for the financial support that she has received from VFMexico. With the new loan she will buy more material, specifically string, ribbon, and yarn.<br \/><br \/>Another positive point to her business is that she has the opportunity to spend plenty of time with her daughter and tend to the household chores while she earns an income. Her goal is to continue learning in order to improve the quality of her products.

The group chose the name because the community looks like a snail shell. The members of the group are: Mar\u00eda \u2013 clothing;  Epifan\u00eda and Reyes \u2013 freight and taxi business; \r\nLucia and Isidoro - Fish (Bream); Emma \u2013 grocery store;  Jos\u00e9 \u2013 shoes; Esperanza \u2013 snacks. Epifan\u00eda is 54 years old. Twelve years ago she became a widow, and from then on she has been father and mother to her four children, two of whom are still financially dependent. Previously, she worked as a teacher in her local school. When her daughter graduated, she gave her the position. This was how, ten years ago, she decided to start a freight business because in order to leave her community and get to the highway where one takes the bus, one must travel some 6 kilometers that are difficult when it is very hot or when it rains. In order to give her family the best and give her children an education, and also to pay for her husband's funeral expenses, Epifan\u00eda gives employment to two people who are the drivers of her freight business. She pays their salaries with the obtained earnings. They have invested the given loans in the service of station wagons in order to give quality service to their customers. The drivers of the freight business have promised to keep their cars clean and drive carefully. In order to be informed of what is happening, she acquired three radio equipments, which help monitor if the cars run out of gas, have flat tires, get stuck in traffic, and to come assist them. To get a larger taxi concession and to continue with this business for her children, Epi - as she is known in her town- struggles day by day to have 5 or more cars to give a quality service with accessible costs and increase her income. The loan they have requested will be invested in maintaining the two station wagons and reupholstering the car seats. The group is grateful for the given opportunity of a new loan, because it means a new growth opportunity for each one of their activities. *These are the members of the Caracol Group. Epi is wearing a green color blouse.

This form of work allows her to generate sufficient resources to support her family financially, as she is single and has a child.<br \/><br \/>When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responded that she likes the meetings about finance and health that Pro Mujer offers."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1968791,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy furniture.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2015-09-03T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-03T13:20:01Z","loan_amount":3600,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rolando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raquel Aleida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":24768,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":3600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2693.36},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2887.68},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2966.08},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3046.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3129.6},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3214.72},{"due_date":"2016-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3302.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3527.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":391.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":419.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":431.12},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":442.84},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":454.88},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":467.26},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":479.95},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":512.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andy","image":1962372}},{"id":941573,"name":"Pili","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pili is a married mother of one child who attends school.

Aside from hard work and patience, capital is one of the bases for her business\u2019 success to take place.

is a hard-working 49 year old woman. She is married, has four children, and lives in a small rural town. Since childhood Sokina dreamed of being a teacher, but her family's lack of financial resources kept her from attending college. Instead Sokina married right after finishing high school and became a housewife. Even being at home all the time though, Sokina stays busy. She and her husband try to do everything they can to provide their children with everything they need. To earn a consistent income for the family Sokina and her husband began their own business in animal husbandry. Sonia raises livestock, then sells their meat and milk, which earns her a good income. Sokina's husband also works in a local workshop, which earns additional income for the family. Their mutual income is enough for an average livelihood, but but still isn't sufficient to cover all their needs. Now Sokina and her husband would like to buy a few more head of livestock for fattening, so they contacted Arvand, wanting to obtain a loan to purchase the animals. Sokina thanks Arvand in advance for the support, which will improve her family's quality of life. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":68.3,"image":{"id":1959439,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cattle ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-09-03T16:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-03T16:50:04Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sokina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":202.91},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":206.86},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":223.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":227.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":230.64},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":243.29},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":253.42},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":256.94},{"due_date":"2016-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":270.15},{"due_date":"2016-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":277},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":286.7},{"due_date":"2016-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":321.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.82},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.18},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.96},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.44},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.55},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.24},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.82},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.02},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.17},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.78},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":68.3,"local_amount":409.77,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":430.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755520193}],"funded_date":"2015-10-03T12:12:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":941752,"name":"Bircan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bircan is 38 years old and lives with her mother.

Her business is located in the outskirts of the city and her main customers are the general community. Working 6 days a week and 11 hours a day, she earns about SLL 1,200,000 every month from this business. <br \/><br \/>She would like a loan in the amount of SLL 5,000,000.

His parents taught him how to look after cattle since his childhood, and now he is teaching it to his own children. Egamurod had a herd of cattle, but when his daughter fell ill and she needed an operation he sold all of his cows, leaving only three. A few years have passed and now his daughter is fully recovered and helps her father to look after the cattle. All the family looks after the animals with love; it is like a hobby for them. Since he only has a few cows, Egamurod has decided to increase his herd of cattle, and he wants to have a lot of cows once again. He needs money for this, and he has applied to Arvand for a loan.

I have two sisters on my father's side: one works and is a student, and the other is only a student. I am married and have a 7-month-old daughter. My mother is a homemaker and my father works as a chauffeur. \n\nI need this loan because, even though I work, my income is not enough to support my family and pay for school. That's why I am asking for help because I want to see my studies through to the end. There was a time when I saw the need to stop, and now that I've started I don't want to give up. I want to be a professional and set a good example for my daughter. I want to be able to provide for my family in the future with a better position in society. \n\nIf I don't receive a loan, I might have to quit one day since my family depends on me. There could be months that I don't have money to pay for school and my goals and dreams would be delayed. This loan would change my life, giving me the chance to achieve my dreams and have the degree that I so badly want and that will make me a better person.\n\nAmong my academic goals is to pass each semester with good grades, not neglecting a single subject, and have a good grade point average overall so that I don't delay my degree. At home, I want to help support my mother with whatever she needs. I want to be able to make a better living situation for my wife and daughter, and be able to say \"yes\" to the things that my daughter needs instead of worrying about what I can't provide. \n\nI want to have a good job and develop my skills to pay off what has made my education possible. I want to work in the business sector to develop strategies that allow companies' growth.\n
