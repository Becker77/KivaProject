She offers a wide array of cosmetics, perfumes, creams, items of clothing and other products that are on sale. Nonetheless, since she has insufficient capital to pay of the invoices, she applied for her first Kiva loan through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to buy items of clothing to fill her customers' orders and pay off an invoice. With this investment, she will be capitalized so she can respond to her customers' demands. Her goals for the future are to open a commercial locale and continue her education so she can graduate from college.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100.93,"image":{"id":1953979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy items of clothing ordered by her customers and to pay off a bill.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Chocont\u00e1\/ Cundinamarca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-09-03T20:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-03T20:20:08Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deisy Lorena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":98193},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":108639},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":111898},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":115255},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":118713},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":122274},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":125942},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":129720},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":133612},{"due_date":"2016-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":137620},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":141749},{"due_date":"2016-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":156385}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.1},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.4},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.43},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.59},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.08},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.31},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.58},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.89},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":65.5,"local_amount":206832,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":207688.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730994685},{"amount":35.43,"local_amount":111898,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":112361.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752082637}],"funded_date":"2015-09-22T22:46:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Wendy Harris","image":null}},{"id":941896,"name":"Allen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Allen is a married lady with children.

My mother is the caretaker of a church and my father sells pastries.<br \/><br \/>I want to study Hotel and Tourism Management at the Universidad Apec, because since I was very young, I have liked to cook and put things together. I have always had a different style for school activities that have led to me choosing this major. I also really like administration. I have always had the qualities of a business manager. I still haven't been able to go to college due to a lack of finances but I have been accepted there. <br \/><br \/>I need the loan because through it, I will cover the necessary expenses for the major and for college. Without the loan, I couldn't go to school at this time and I would have to start working until I can save up the necessary amount to cover college. It would have an affect because if I have to stop going to school to work, this could delay my education and my desire to be a college graduate. My elementary and high school education were excellent and I was always awarded with different acknowledgements. For example, the Ministry of Education of the Dominican Republic rewarded me for being one of the students with the highest academic average. <br \/><br \/>Among my academic goals are being one if the students at the university with the highest average, being able to stand out as a student in the area and being able to finish my education with the highest competence of the major I will study. Among my family goals are to give all of the support necessary to contribute with any necessity within my reach. My personal goal is to grow as a person with the talents to be developed in my major and to continue standing out as a dedicated person, which I consider myself to be. <br \/><br \/>After finishing, I want to work in my field and then I want to study another major.

This is his story: My name is Junior, I am 25 years old, single with no children, and I live in the zone east of Santo Domingo. I have 3 brothers and 3 sisters. My mother is a domestic worker and my father is a businessman. I am studying medicine at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo (UASD). I am studying this major because I like to deal with people, and helping others to solve their health needs fills me with satisfaction. I am at the end of my degree program, I only have 6 subjects left, the pre-residency and the residency, which will bring me to finish in a period of 2 years. My favorite subjects have been anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, microbiology, infectology, cardiology, immunology, and pathological anatomy. <br \/><br \/>I need this loan to be able to finish my education since my father and mother have made it possible to help me up to this point, but at this time they have become unable, for reasons of health and low-paying jobs. They lack the economic resources to be able to help me with my degree, so I see the need to access loans and am taking advantage of this service that Fudapec offers. Without a loan such as that offered by Kiva and Fundapec, my education will be ruined and my plans and goals for the future will be broken. For this reason, I ask you to give me the opportunity and to be able to improve myself to the maximum.  I am sure that with the approval of this loan, my ideals and development as a person will be achieved. <br \/><br \/>My goal is primarily to be a professional, achieve high positions in my specialty and my profession. After I finish my degree, I will begin a work in the same area as my degree as a general doctor and participate in a specialty of surgery. I also will do a certification program and a masters

","en":"Rodolfo is a small producer of certified coffee with Fair Trade and Rainforest. Coffee production is the only means of subsistence for his family, comprised by him, his wife Deysi Marina and their 3 children. At 56, Rodolfo is the leader of his coffee crops, which is not so difficult thanks to his more than 36 years of experience producing coffee. Rodolfo likes implementing new production techniques in order to increase the quality and quantity of the harvested coffee. Rodolfo's main objective is that his coffee plantations are a healthy place, where people can work without risking their health, and to be paid justly and equitably. Organic coffee production is one of the opportunities that Rodolfo sees to have more market opportunities for his harvest, besides allowing him to make his plots environmentally friendly and more self-sustaining. Rodolfo is requesting a loan to start the work of conversion to organic, without neglecting his Fair Trade and Rainforest commerce practices. Roberto has decided to start the process of conversion to organic production with totally new coffee crops, since the plantations he currently has are very damaged, so he will replant and start this conversion with totally new plants. A loan will help Rodolfo to buy organic fertilizers, coffee plants of organic origin, to pay for hand labor and other organic origin materials needed for the conversion process. With the earned income, Rodolfo hopes to have access to medicine and what is basic for a decent life, and that his employees have the opportunity to work in a more healthy environment without highly toxic agents, and that they have a just treatment."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1969862,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Fair Trade"],"use":"to buy materials to convert his coffee crops to organic, such as: organic fertilizers, coffee plants, and to pay for hand labor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Corqu\u00edn, Copan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":448,"posted_date":"2015-09-04T12:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-04T12:50:02Z","loan_amount":3675,"lender_count":111,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jos\u00e9 Rodolfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":3675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2018-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":15790},{"due_date":"2019-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":18316.4},{"due_date":"2020-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":21247.02},{"due_date":"2021-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":24646.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725.35},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":841.41},{"due_date":"2020-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":976.04},{"due_date":"2021-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1132.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-02T22:42:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Mueller","image":null}},{"id":940086,"name":"Nyemamba Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Fulgence  fait partie du groupe Nyemamba et  habite \u00e0 Bujumbura.

Her workshop has now been operating for three years, offering all types of clothing for ladies and gentlemen: shirts, pants, dresses and school uniforms, among others. She carries out all steps of the tailoring process: design, cutting, preparation, assembly and finishing of the final pieces. <br \/><br \/>Consuelo would like to work without delays and not depend on the deposits given to her by her customers. For this reason, she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. She will invest the funds in supplies for her workshop, such as fabric, thread, appliques, buttons, zippers and other items. This investment will allow her to shorten her production times and achieve higher margins, since she will be able to purchase materials on sale at better prices. <br \/><br \/>Her goals for the future are to expand her tailoring operation and buy a house."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":42.91,"image":{"id":1969924,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to invest in supplies for her workshop, such as fabric, thread, appliques, buttons, zippers, and other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-09-04T13:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-04T13:50:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Consuelo Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":850000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":59893},{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":61690},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":63540},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":65447},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":67410},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":69432},{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":71515},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":73661},{"due_date":"2016-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":75871},{"due_date":"2016-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":78147},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":80491},{"due_date":"2016-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":82903}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.14},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.43},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.79},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.78},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.58},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.41},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.14,"local_amount":59893,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:26:41Z","rounded_local_amount":64502.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730994816},{"amount":21.77,"local_amount":61690,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":66438.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752082764}],"funded_date":"2015-09-10T22:24:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":942224,"name":"Jesusa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jesusa has been a fish vendor for 7 years now.

An amount of PHP 10,000 could help her in the renovation and beautification of their place so that her regular boarders will choose to stay there for a longer period of time. She will also use portion of the loan to add up to the capital needed for her transportation business. She sincerely lets you know her heartfelt thanks and appreciation for this assistance in advance.<br \/><br \/>In the future, Justina hopes that they could attract more boarders. She also desires to start up other business for their additional income. Justina meets with her co-fellowship members* every week to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/>* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":165,"image":{"id":1970264,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Property","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to pay for the renovation and maintenance of their boarding house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"General Trias, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-09-04T14:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-04T14:00:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":4666.69,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:36:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4909.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955565},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2805.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045410}],"funded_date":"2015-09-05T02:39:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michael Angelilli","image":1331534}},{"id":942228,"name":"Miriam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Miriam is a married woman with three children.

Because of this, even before he was an adult, his mother saw in him great potential for business and decided to involve him in the family business.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Manuel contributes financially and by waiting on customers, which is vitally important for things to run smoothly while selling meals.  He does this from the comfort of his home, located in a neighborhood in Barranquilla.  Every day his mother has a menu of meals, including grilled meat, soups, cakes, and filled savory pies.  She sells these to the people who live in the area, who place orders ahead of time, or who simply stop by the shop.  \r\n\r\nHe is currently applying for a Kiva loan, his first loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, in order to make some upgrades on the shop and, in this way, offer better customer service.  His goal in the future is to continue to improve the business\u2019s image and to be able to enroll in the university."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1969942,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to make some upgrades to his shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-09-04T14:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-04T14:50:05Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel Fernando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1280000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":68431},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":92244},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":95011},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":97862},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100797},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":103821},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":106936},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":110144},{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":113448},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":116852},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":120357},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":154097}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.72},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.63},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.55},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.49},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.47},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.47},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.51},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.57},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.67},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.8},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.96},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":942241,"name":"Erma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erma is 50 years old and married with one child in school.

He started working in the 1980s, for a tailor first, then setting up his own tailoring business.  He learned welding next and had his own welding business for a while before going on to study music.

The area is also known for the use of natural dyes for pretty textiles.\n\nSeven women in search of a better and more prosperous future have joined together to form the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cGuadalupe.\u201d They have textile businesses making napkins, scarves, shawls and hammocks, a food business and a bakery.\n\nElena is a young, married member of the Trust Bank who is 28 years of age with two children who are in elementary school. Along with her husband, she has a bakery business and bakes bread daily that she sells from her home. Elena is requesting a loan to purchase supplies for the business including lard, sugar, flour and firewood. Her biggest dream is to open a bakery shop in the center of her town, attract more customers and increase her earnings. She is determined to reach this goal!\n\nElena and her friends in the Guadalupe Trust Bank look forward to their monthly meetings when they transact business on their loans.

As work that allows him to keep in constant activity and in no case moving to a passive life without protection, for 6 years he has worked renting washing machines. The idea for the business occurred to him upon seeing that there was an unmet demand in the sector, since the availability of this service was insufficient. He began with two washing machines and little by little his demand increased, in such a way that a month later he bought 5 more. His customer base is made up of the people in the neighborhood to whom he offers his service daily from 7:00 am to 4.00 pm.

She works as a daily wage labourer in the agriculture sector. She has three members in her family including a teen aged child. Her monthly saving is Rs. 1,000 only. She has no toilet at home or in the immediate vicinity. Rajeswari\u2019s family is one of the millions affected by rural India's sanitation crisis. Without access to a toilet, her family has to walk long distances to relieve themselves in the false privacy of dense bushes or isolated fields. Hence subsequently putting themselves at a risk of infection, molestation, and even insect or animal bites. \n\nJoining hands with Pappathi, Padma, and Dhanalakshmi whose families all face similar problems due to a lack of sanitation facilities, she has formed a group of four members and is hoping to address this issue. Access to a toilet will mean privacy and peace of mind for Rajeswari and family. It will also mean they no longer need to walk long distances, especially when they are sick.

She is requesting a loan to do this and hopes it will be funded by Kiva lenders.<br \/><br \/>Astrid and her friends in the Trust Bank enjoy their monthly meetings when they come together, listen and talk to each other, make payments on their loans and then participate in educational training sessions with a Friendship Bridge Facilitator. Each month, a different topic is covered using pictures, diagrams, games and role playing. <br \/><br \/>The ladies in the Trust Bank are certain that without the support of Kiva lenders, it would not be possible for them to move ahead, expand their businesses and increase earnings.

Agriculture plays an important role here as well and there are many farmers who grow corn, beans, wheat and potatoes. Others raise sheep. \u201cToto\u201d is also known for the production of woven skirts called \u201ccortes\u201d that come in a variety of beautiful and colorful patterns. Other cottage industries include the production of leather goods, pottery and furniture.<br \/><br \/>The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cTornasol\u201d was formed by 11 extroverted and motivated women.

Along with the bright flowers on the \u201chuipiles\u201d seen in the above photo, they are also known for their many embroidered bird designs.<br \/><br \/>Ten women, who did not have the opportunity for a formal education, formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cArtesanas Santiago\u201d (Santiago Artisans). The women have spent many years in the artisan and craft business of weaving and embroidering fabrics for \u201chuipiles\u201d that have been commissioned by clients. Some of the women also raise chickens.<br \/><br \/>\u201cArtesanas Santiago\u2019s\u201d president is Micaela, who is married with two children. Right now, the demand for her textiles is very high and she is getting many orders for her \u201chuipiles.\u201d She is requesting a loan to purchase a variety of typical fabrics and many different colored threads for embroidering. Micaela hopes that in buying these textile supplies, she will be able to improve her \u201chuipiles,\u201d increase her customer base, and generate more income. <br \/><br \/>Micaela and her Trust Bank companions enjoy being clients of Friendship Bridge through many loan cycles. They have had the opportunity to learn about gender equity, good business investments, and holistic health. These topics and many more are a part of Friendship Bridge\u2019s \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d program of micro loans and non-formal education that has proven to be a win-win combination for the women, helping them to move from poverty to a brighter and more successful future. <br \/><br \/>Thank you to all Kiva investors who have contributed to their support and had faith in their ability to move ahead and create a more prosperous tomorrow, benefitting themselves, their families, and their community in Santiago Atitl\u00e1n!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1062.68,"image":{"id":1970686,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a variety of typical fabrics and many different colored threads for embroidering.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santiago de Atitl\u00e1n, Solol\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2015-09-04T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-04T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":6375,"lender_count":132,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Concepcion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Micaela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Micaela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta Damian ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candelaria Rosangelica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":49000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":6375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4084},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4084},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4084},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4084},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4084},{"due_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4084},{"due_date":"2016-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":4084},{"due_date":"2016-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4084},{"due_date":"2016-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4084},{"due_date":"2016-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4084},{"due_date":"2016-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4084},{"due_date":"2016-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4076}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":531.34},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":531.34},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":531.34},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":531.34},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":531.34},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":531.34},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":531.34},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":531.34},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":531.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":531.33},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":531.33},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":530.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":531.34,"local_amount":4084,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T14:18:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4086.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730991606},{"amount":531.34,"local_amount":4084,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:16:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4086.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752079878}],"funded_date":"2015-09-10T01:40:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":942003,"name":"Mercedes","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mercedes de 51 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su madre y su compa\u00f1ero de vida ella se dedica a la venta de ropa y zapatos desde hace 5 a\u00f1os, con lo que obtiene de sus ventas logra salir adelante, ella quiere mejorar su vivienda cambiando las puertas y ventanas pero como no posee de suficiente capital esta solicitando un credito para la compra de puertas, balcones para ventanas y pago de mano de obra y asi poder vivir mas seguros y comodos.
