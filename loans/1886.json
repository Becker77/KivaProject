He does not get very good harvests because there is not enough water, but he doesn't complain, because he is used to living humbly, and he has enough. <br \/><br \/>His family is very harmonious, so they all work together in the field, helping each other. Next season, Alisher hopes for a good harvest, but at the moment he has some problems. Because he has so much land and no water, he built a pump, but his pipes burst and he wants to buy new pipes to replace them. He does not have the large amount of money that this would require, so he has applied to MDO Arvand for a loan.

Starting in childhood, Nasiba dreamed of becoming a teacher, but she ended up never being able to attend university due to her family's finances.  Right after finishing secondary school, Nasiba married and became a housewife.  But even though she spends most of her time in the home, she's never idle.  She and her husband do everything possible to provide their children with all the necessities of life.\r\n\r\nTo have a constant source of income for food, Nasiba and her husband started their own business raising livestock.  Nasiba raises cattle, then sells the milk and meat they produce.  She earns a good living from this business.  Nasiba's husband also works in a local workshop, and his work brings in extra money for the family.  Their combined income is enough for an average standard of living, and they have enough to money to pay for all their current needs.  \r\n\r\nAt the moment, Nasiba and her husband want to buy a few more heads of cattle for fattening.

","en":"Meet Mohira.  Mohira works as a cleaning lady in a hospital.  In addition to her job, she is also an independent seamstress and she sews traditional Tajik dresses from her home.  She is a kind and smart woman who works very well.  She learned how to design and sew clothes a few years ago.  Mohira just turned 38.  She lives in the city of Dushanbe with her husband and her five children.  Her husband is an engineer currently working on a water canal.  Mohira enjoys the daily income that she makes thanks to her sewing activity.\r\n\r\nMohira and her husband have decided to build a house.  Their house is almost complete, but not entirely finished.  They still need to plaster the walls and to buy various construction supplies to finish all construction.  Mohira has requested a loan because she doesn't have enough personal resources.
