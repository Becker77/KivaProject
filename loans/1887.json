On the way to the village, you can see sugar cane, sorgho, mango, maize, and nanche fields. Most of the inhabitants of the village are thus farmers.\r\n   The members of the group are: Emiliano, who sells sugar cane; Mirna, a carpenter; Mar\u00eda, who raises pigs; Concepci\u00f3n, an apothecary; Deysi, who sells meat; Dulce, who sells cosmetics; and Gloria, who sells drinks and bread.\r\n   Concepci\u00f3n is know by all by her monikers, 'Concha' or 'Conchita'. She is a very amiable person. She has 10 children, all of whom live now on their own. She was a nurse at the village's clinic for 36 years, which is where she acquired all the knowledge and experience necessary to open her own apothecary, which she did eight years ago. She does not just sell medicine, she also gives first aid and assesses people's health for those who need it. \"If you are not born to help others, you are useless to society\", she says to drive home how big a responsibility she feels she has. Her shop is open Mondays to Sundays  at fixed times. Of course, should an emergency arise, the doors will open regardless of the hour.\r\n   With her profits, she is able to cover expenses and buy medicine and supplies (analgesics, cold medicine, antibiotics, syringes, gauze) to replenish her stock.

viajar diariamente hasta la capital para ofrecer distintos servicios, en especial los de alba\u00f1iler\u00eda. No obstante cualquier esfuerzo es poco si se trata de ofrecer mayores oportunidades a sus familias. Los dem\u00e1s habitantes hacen lo propio desde los campos de cultivo donde siembran la papa, o bien en la cr\u00eda de ganado. \n   El grupo La Palma Verde es originario de dicha comunidad y su nombre hace referencia a una gran palmera que identifica a su localidad. Al ser un territorio peque\u00f1o, todos se conocen y llevan una buena relaci\u00f3n de vecinos.\n   Patricia es una mujer trabajadora y amable cuya mayor motivaci\u00f3n es su peque\u00f1o hijo a quien ha tenido que criar sola. Desde hace m\u00e1s de diez a\u00f1os se ha dedicado a la elaboraci\u00f3n de manteles, servilletas y otros tipos de bordados artesanales. Para Paty, como le llaman de cari\u00f1o, esta actividad es una tradici\u00f3n ya que su madre y abuela le ense\u00f1aron a bordar, \u201cellas dec\u00edan que una buena ama de casa deber\u00eda elaborar sus propias servilletas para envolver las tortillas\u201d coment\u00f3 con una sonrisa. \n  En un mes realiza tres o cuatro bordados aproximadamente lo que representa una ganancia estable, los clientes suelen llevarle los materiales necesarios con los que se encarga de llevar a cabo su obra. El pr\u00e9stamo le es de gran ayuda pues le resulta complicado reinvertir en materiales para su labor; por lo tanto aprovecha al m\u00e1ximo este beneficio. Ahora con la ayuda pretende comprar hilos, tela cuadrille, agujas, etc. La meta de Paty es aumentar su producci\u00f3n para ofrecer una mejor calidad de vida a su hijo por medio de la educaci\u00f3n, del mismo modo desea formar un patrimonio para el futuro.\n   Las dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Ma. del Socorro, Agripina y Juliana quienes invertir\u00e1n en la compra de ovejas para su cr\u00eda. \n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en las escalas del quiosco municipal, Paty es quien viste la sudadera rosa.\n","en":"The majority of the inhabitants of a certain Mexican location have to travel to the capital daily to offer various services, especially those of masonry. Nevertheless, any effort is little if it is a matter of offering better opportunities to their families. The other residents make their own efforts from the farm fields where they raise potatoes or cattle.\r\n\r\nThe group La Palma Verde is from this community, and its name refers to a great palm tree that identifies their location. Because it is a small area, everyone knows each other, and they have good neighborly relationships.\r\n\r\nPatricia is a hard-working and friendly woman whose great motivation is her little son, whom she has had to raise alone. For more than 10 years, she has made tablecloths, napkins, and other types of embroidered handicrafts. For Paty, as she is affectionately called, this work is a tradition, since her mother and grandmother taught her to embroider. \"They said that a good housewife should make her own napkins for wrapping the tortillas,\" she comments with a smile.\r\n\r\nIn a month, she makes approximately three or four embroideries, which represents stable earnings. The customers usually bring her the necessary materials with which she has the task of completing her work. The loan is a great help for her, since it becomes complicated for her to reinvest in materials for her work. Thus she takes maximum advantage of this benefit. Now, with the help, she plans to buy thread, checked fabric, needles, etc. Paty's goal is to increase her production in order to offer a better quality of life to her son through education. In the same way, she wants to create an inheritance for the future.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Maria del Socorro, Agripina, and Juliana, who will invest in the purchase of sheep to raise.\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken on the steps of the municipal market. Paty is the one wearing the pink sweatshirt.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":455.22,"image":{"id":1964513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy thread, checked fabric, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"SAN JOAQUIN LAMILLAS, SAN JOSE DEL RINCON","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-09-06T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-06T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Del Socorro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agripina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3682.31},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3904.72},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4054.71},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4282.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4463.94},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4683.04},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":4928.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.94},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":234.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":243.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":256.97},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":267.84},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280.98},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":220.94,"local_amount":3682.5,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:58:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3720.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204540},{"amount":234.28,"local_amount":3904.92,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3945.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291961}],"funded_date":"2015-09-10T05:04:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":943260,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita wants to help her daughter fulfill her dream of completing a college degree.

This is the reason that the greater part of the population works in agriculture. The fields that dot the landscape are divided into crops of sugar cane, corn, beans, rice, mango, papaya, coffee and vanilla. At the same time fishing has gained an important role in the economic activity as many people visit the area to acquire fresh and good quality fish. <br \/><br \/>This community is the home of the \"Lucero\" group whose members are: Apolonia who sells soft drinks; Juan and Luisa sell fish; Ver\u00f3nica sells traditional food and Abigail sells cosmetics. As for Marco he runs a tire repair business and Petra operates a laundromat.  <br \/><br \/>Marco Antonio is a youth who, besides helping his parents with the household expenses, wants to provide a good example for his younger siblings. To\u00f1o as he is known by his friends, worked for a year in a tire repair shop in his community. However his enterprising character lead him to create his own business five years ago. Based on the quality and good service he has managed to expand his shop and extend his services to include motorcycles. In the beginning he only had a wedge and a tire iron and his space was very small so most of his work had to be taken outside to do. Today his area is much bigger and his equipment has increased. \"I end up covered in grease and dirt but that is not important as my customers are satisfied and I earn my living in an honest way\" he commented with enthusiasm. As mentioned part of his success comes from his service, plus he offers home service and if the client can't pay the bill he offers them credit. <br \/><br \/>For To\u00f1o the loan represents a new investment which will make the growth of his business more noticeable. In the future he wants to provide employment for other people and open another branch. At this time he will invest the loan in the purchase of patches, glue and a tire iron. <br \/><br \/>*These are the members of the group.

It is sweetened with powdered brown sugar which also gives it a unique taste. One Mexican community is celebrated for having the bread-makers who make this product the best. The recipes which they use have passed from generation to generation and it is more than a business for them - it is a tradition worthy of pride.<br \/>Fermina is a member of the La Espiga group, the name of which makes reference to the plant which provides the grain which eventually becomes flour: the raw material for their activity, breadmaking. She is a tireless woman, who is prepared to work ferociously for her children, who are studying.<br \/>\"Now I am the third generation in charge of the business and my children are also learning to make traditional bread\", says Fermina, who has been in charge of the bakery for twelve years. From when she was young, she observed her parents going out to sell their products at festivals, conventions and parties in one community or another. To begin with they cooked with firewood, but now they have gas ovens and shops which are adapted to their business. Being originally from the region where they make the best 'pan de fiesta', there is lots of competition but far from worrying about that, she works to improve the quality and taste of her products all the time so that her customers continue to want to buy it.<br \/>With the money from the loan, she will buy flour, yeast, sugar, etc. which are the ingredients which she uses the most. It is worth mentioning that she is very happy and motivated because every investment made is reflected in the attractive earnings which she obtains. One of her dreams is to open another business to provide education for her children. \"My daughter wants to study for a career with computers and I want her dreams to become a reality\", Fermina says happily.<br \/>The other members of the group are Francisca, Cristina and Magdalena who, in the same way, will invest in raw materials to make bread.<br \/>**The photograph was taken on the steps of the town pavillion.

The majority of the inhabitants grow corn and raise barnyard animals. It's worthy to note that this is the best season to appreciate the panorama of the region as spring brings out the beauty and colors of the countryside.<br \/><br \/>Cecilia is a hard-working woman who is always smiling as it is her way of feeling good and making those around her feel good. She lives with her husband Jos\u00e9 who works as a bricklayer and together they form a family with their three children, two of whom are dependent on them. While Jos\u00e9 makes his living as a bricklayer, Ceci as she is called with affection, makes her own money raising sheep. She has raised sheep for 20 years and the quality that she provides her customers backs up her work. Plus it is a business that allows her to take care of her children while making income for their studies. <br \/><br \/>Her routine starts very early when she takes the sheep out to pasture. \"When we started our business, we only had three sheep and thanks to the loans from VF M\u00e9xico we have gotten up to ten at a time,\" Ceci very contently explained. Once the animals reach their ideal weight she sells them to the barbecue businesses who make a dish unique to the region. One of her dreams is to remodel her house and she wants her children to complete study to be professionals so that they have a good quality of living. <br \/><br \/>The members of the group are: Elizabeth, Edelia, Lucero, and Maria who will invest buying sheep; Benito, in turkeys y Guadalupe in her grocery store..<br \/><br \/>*The photograph was taken on the steps of the municipal kiosk.

The points of sale are quite varied, but are primarily municipal parties and markets. Likewise, she sells them from house to house to earn a better income. Currently, 6 of her children carry out the same activity and each one of them has their own business. The competition is healthy, and she is content that all are able to benefit from such delicious work.\r\n\r\nNow with the opportunity of the loan, she will be able to buy flour, butter, yeast, eggs, etc. This will help her to produce at a greater scale. Her goal is to be able to buy another vehicle to move her product with greater efficiency between the three stands she manages. With the profits gained from her sales, she bought tubes to construct new stands where she offers her merchandise. In addition, Susi commented happily that \"Thanks to the loans we now have gas stoves that allow us to sell hot bread as well as pizzas.\"\r\n\r\nThe other group members are Patricia, who will invest in a pharmacy, while Graciela and Norma Isela will invest in baking bread.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken in the stairs of the municipal pavilion.
