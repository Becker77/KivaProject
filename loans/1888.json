The rural community of Sacapulas is located here and is the home of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cClaveles Rosadas\u201d or \u201cPink Carnations\u201d that was formed by eight enthusiastic hardworking women with dreams of overcoming poverty! <br \/><br \/>One of the members of \u201cClaveles Rosadas\u201d  is 29 year old Candelaria who is working towards a better future.  Currently, she is studying to be a nurse and hopes to graduate soon.  In order to cover her school expenses and to help her family financially, Candelaria owns a mini-mart.  Although the mini-mart is doing well, she needs to increase her inventory of food-stuffs because of new requests from her customers.  This is the reason she is asking for a loan so that she can buy eggs, noodles, beans, rice, sugar, oil, juices, etc...everything her customers want. She is very happy that she can get a loan in order to expand her business which then supports her studies.  Her parents are too poor to be able to help her with her dreams. <br \/><br \/>The eight women of \u201cClaveles Rosadas\u201d look forward their monthly meetings when they make payments on their loans. The \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program of Friendship Bridge, that combines education and small loans provides successful tools for the ladies. They actively participate in  training in subjects like women\u2019s rights, women\u2019s and children\u2019s health issues, self-esteem, business management, and leadership.  These are a few of the many topics presented by a Facilitator from the organization.   Candelaria and her companions recognize the value of these monthly meetings and are deeply grateful to the Kiva investors for providing them with the opportunities to develop their lives, their businesses and their communities.

As a local tourist guide I took visitors to elephant camps and temples, and to see wonderful handcrafts of Chiang Mai: lacquerware, silverware, saa paper, and wood carvings. Demonstration of each craft helped visitors understand local traditions. I became so enamored I decided to rent a small shop to sell local wood carvings. I met my husband here. He was a messenger and when his employer faced economic trouble and closed, he joined me at the shop. By offering unique designs we are better able to ensure high quality products, provide good income for local artisans, and promote the use of sustainable materials. Most of my hand-carved pieces use teak salvaged from unused buildings. Tourism has decreased a lot, but we don't think of closing because we are happy to be a part of the conservation and promotion of Thai crafts.\"<br \/><br \/>\"This loan will help me buy materials in bulk at a better price.

In the profile photo there is Suripno, Abdul\u2019s close friend who has agreed to be photographed for Kiva. He wears the batik shirt and blue cap, in the first row. He is shown along with the rest of the group members. They are standing in front of a cow house. Abdul has a family with two children and lives in a tiny village in Lampung Tengah, Indonesia. \r\n\r\nAbdul has been running a small-scale rice farming business and keeps a few cows to fatten and resell. His business is going quite well. However, he was concerned to see the high price of non-renewable cooking gas and chemical fertilizers. He also saw the cow dung being wasted in the nearby field, which pollutes the air with a pungent odor. \r\n\r\nAfter becoming associated with Yayasan Rumah Energi (YRE) and Harapan Bersama Mason Group (a local organization, founded by YRE as a biogas construction partner), Abdul learned about the Household Biogas (BIRU) program. Abdul saw that biogas is a good solution to his problem. He saw an opportunity to reduce his dependence on non-renewable cooking gas. In addition, he wants to use bioslurry (biogas residue) as organic fertilizer for his plantation. In order to make it happen, Abdul invited eight of his farmer friends to form a borrower group. He is so keen to purchase a biodigester, but he does not have sufficient capital for it. A loan from Kiva will help him and other group members to make it possible. \r\n\r\nAbdul has an optimism that if he can build a biodigester, he can use the biogas for cooking and use the bioslurry (biogas residue) as fertilizer for his plantation. He also wants to sell the remaining bioslurry to increase his family income. He hopes that in the future, he can invite all the farmers in his village to use biogas.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1971855,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion","Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to build a biodigester facility and utilize bioslurry (biogas residue) as organic fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Lampung Tengah","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":423,"posted_date":"2015-09-07T16:00:21Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-07T16:00:21Z","loan_amount":3825,"lender_count":135,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Igo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Iwan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jayadi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ujang","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tijo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":54000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":3825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":9000000},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":9000000},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":9000000},{"due_date":"2016-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":9000000},{"due_date":"2017-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":9000000},{"due_date":"2017-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":9000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":637.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-09-18T13:28:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shivaugn Ahern","image":null}},{"id":943466,"name":"Ganjina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ganjina is an active girl.

She not only takes care of her children but has to take care of her four young grandchildren and husband aged 71. Mantaoleng lives in a traditional hut that is not well ventilated, nor warms up well in winter. She works long hours to ensure there is enough food for her entire family, some of whom are going to school and only help her in the field on Saturdays and Sundays. She has to wake up very early, between 3am and 4am, during the week to start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water and warming the house for all the children before they go to school. <br \/><br \/>Collecting firewood, setting up the fire and doing the actual cooking demands a lot of her time. Temperatures in the Lesotho highlands are never really high; winters can get very cold and often Mantaoleng has to start the fire inside her hut. Starting a fire releases smog and smoke which when inhaled in large quantities over a period of time can lead to lung diseases, eye problems and in the worst case to death. In these circumstances, life for women like Mantaoleng has been very difficult. <br \/><br \/>Mantaoleng has requested a loan from Kiva lenders, in order to be able to purchase clean cook stoves which provide her and 13 other people from her village, who are living in the same circumstances, the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families, and that does not require a lot of wood, which is hard to find in Lesotho, nor expensive paraffin and gas. This stove can be started with the use of very little, readily available biomass like dry twigs and dry cow dung that do not require lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the homes. <br \/><br \/>This stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery which runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones and a mini LED lamp. A life improving package for these people. This stove saves them time to be with their family, saves energy, eliminates the element of toxic inhalation, house burning and has given them the freedom to have a better lit home to see better in the evening while cooking and enables children to do their homework.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 1000 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nSt. Joseph's Ombachi School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

Micaela, a 61-year-old woman who has never been to school, commented that she has definitely seen this kind of change in her business. Micaela runs her business with the objective of improving her family's quality of life, embroidering and weaving traditional Guatemalan \u201chuipiles\u201d, or blouses, napkins, and \u201cperrajes\u201d, large cloths used for carrying babies and goods. With the new loan that she is requesting, this intelligent woman will buy more products, such as different styles and colors of better quality thread, which she can use to embroider more blouses, napkins, and cloths.

Lety, as she is better known, is very proud of her young ones, as at the end of the semester they always receive first place in academic progress.<br \/><br \/>Nine years ago, when she decided to start a family, she began raising barnyard fowl.  The process can take up to five months to reach ideal development of the birds.  In the meantime, she uses the eggs.  The animals are used not only for sales but also for personal use, in different prepared dishes.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, due to abrupt changes in temperature, the birds got sick, and Lety's income suffered.  Therefore, she decided to begin raising turkeys.  \"For that reason, I decided to switch from chickens to turkeys, as they are more resilient and don't get sick as often,\" she said.  Nevertheless, she maintains a chicken brood for the eggs it provides for her family's nutrition.<br \/><br \/>Separately, she is very thankful for the loan offered because it will make it easy to acquire the animals she needs.  It is also an effective way to contribute to the income of her home and complement the income of her spouse, especially for the education of her daughters.<br \/><br \/>One of her goals is to increase her production and make various corrals to separate the animals according to size.

She has a beautiful smile that spreads to everyone she knows.  She has 8 years experience raising pigs, the income from which goes to meet the expenses of her family, consisting of her husband Oscar and four children.<br \/><br \/>To ensure the optimal growth of her animals, she acquires them when they're very young, in order to care for their health and nutrition.  The need to begin her business arose because the income of her spouse wasn't sufficient to meet the family expenses, above all for the education of their children.  Accordingly, while Oscar works in Mexico City, Lidia cares for the animals in her community.  \"I don't remember exactly how many sheep I started with, but I'm sure it was less than four,\" she recalls.  She has benefited from loans from VF M\u00e9xico for many years.  While the animals reach their appropriate size, the loans help her buy food and supplies for her children.<br \/><br \/>On this occasion, she seeks a new loan to buy four small pigs, since she only has three.  Fortunately, the climate of the region is good for the animals, and they never get sick.  If they were to fall sick, Lidia has the necessary treatments to cure them.  Her primary goal is to be able to increase her production so that her children can obtain professional degrees.  <br \/><br \/>The other members of the group are Irene, Rosa Mar\u00eda and Mar\u00eda Juana who invest in sheep; Martha who invests in corn on the cob; Catalina, Celestina, Juan and Rosa who invest in barnyard animals; Claudia who invests in cows; Rosa Ma. who invests in tortillas: Anayeli who invests in typical snacks; Reynaldo who invests in hats; and Marisol who invests in chickens.  They all live in a very peaceful community where customs and traditions are still preserved.  On February 2nd they celebrate the day of the Candelaria, in which all the inhabitants of the community are participants<br \/><br \/>*The photograph was taken where the group meets.

They have kept their native language and some customs.  The respect the residents show is significant.  For instance, the men take of their hats when greeting others, and the young children kiss their parents', grandparents' and god-parents' hands.  A large part of the population makes their living raising animals, as the vegetation makes that work easy. <br \/><br \/>Do\u00f1a Alicia is a happy person.  Her husband, Ernesto, works in construction.  Together they have formed a family of three children, two of whom go to school.  Eight years ago, do\u00f1a Alicia opened a small grocery.  She has maintained it quite successfully.  The idea to open the store came out of a need to help with the household expenses.  Besides, she lives close to the busiest street in her community.  To gain sufficient capital, do\u00f1a Alicia started selling corn on the cob and \u201cesquites\u201d (a snack made from grains of corn that is common in their country).  She saved all her earnings for six months so she could purchase sweets and sodas.  Gradually, her earnings increased and she was able to open her grocery store.   <br \/><br \/>On the other hand, the loans from VF M\u00e9xico have allowed do\u00f1a Alicia to maintain her business.  She uses the loans to purchase bread, eggs, milk, sugar, dairy products, detergents etc.  Do\u00f1a Alicia's main objective is to expand her business and improve her family's income.

Most people there are involved in agriculture.  Mirzomad himself raises livestock.  Mirzomad never had the chance to get a higher education and he would like his children to learn more than he did and become well-educated.   Mirzomad's son, Parviz, wants to attend university and get a higher education.  He wants to become successful and help his family.  Mirzomad places all his hopes in his son, and his dream is to see him graduate one day and get a good job.  Mirzomad is taking a loan to pay for his son's tuition.

Currently they are planting corn and the land where they have the harvest is close to their home.  Five years ago Julia decided to start a store where she sells sweets, candies, enchiladas, fried yucca, desserts, and other items.  It has helped her a lot since she sells them to neighbors and this generates income for the well-being of her family. <br \/><br \/>Julia needs a loan in order to buy agricultural products such as seed, fertilizer and pesticides for insects.  She will prepare the land and pay for manual labor. <br \/><br \/>Julia's dream is to repair her home, because the roof is deteriorated and leaks during the rainy season.  She also wants to give her children the opportunity for a University education, so that they can have better opportunities in life."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1972559,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural products such as seed, fertilizer and pesticides for insects.

They are very happy and approachable people, but more than anything they are very hard-working. They live in a very traditional community. This area is characterized as much for making clay pots used for making pi\u00f1atas, as in buying and selling industrial material. With a smile on their faces, the members of the group say, \"In the months of November and December we are 'pi\u00f1ateros' and the rest of the year we are scrap merchants.\" <br \/><br \/>V\u00edctor is a very friendly person. He is single and lives with his parents. For 20 years, he has worked making clay pots and pans. The clay pots are used to make pi\u00f1atas. \"From the time I was young, I saw my father making the products, and thanks to his patience and love, I learned the art of pottery very well,\" he says happily. <br \/><br \/>To make the pots and pans, he has to dry dirt, then grind and mix it until it becomes mud. The next day, he must work with molds where the mud dries and in the afternoon he puts them into the oven to give them resistance. Being that the pi\u00f1atas are very traditional objects for any party, practically all year-round he receives requests to buy more. <br \/><br \/>With the loan, he will be able to buy more dirt since it is the main material, and without a doubt the most requested.
