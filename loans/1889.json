She was grateful when Center for Community Transformation (CCT) approved her previous loan of P25,000 and she was able to buy business essentials everyday. She wants to thank the lenders for the financial provision and thank God, first and foremost, for the people He used to run the business.\r\n\r\nIn a business, difficulties and challenges cannot be avoided. A road repair happening in the area and calamities like a typhoon followed by flooding really affects her daily earnings. Vilma applied for another loan of P30,000 to have additional money when calamities happen and to buy daily ingredients for her food business.

As a fish vendor for the past 19 years, bad weather during rainy seasons has given Daina tough times. A difficult season came this year as El Nino swept her coastal village. Climate reports forecast that this will continue until 2016, and the fish catch has started to be limited.\r\n\r\nDaina is a wise borrower, anticipating the challenging climate changes ahead. She will use the loan of 14,000 PHP to buy additional fishing tools, including cast nets, rod holders, bait prep, and grippers that her husband will need to catch fresh fish to sell. The rest of the fish that they catch will be dried and salted to take advantage of the long dry season. Also, dried fish is priced higher in the market. This will give her more income. Part of the loan will also be utilized to buy additional groceries for her small variety store.\r\n\r\nDaina is committed to save from her income to fund the purchase of more fish and expand her business.

Growing coffee is his only means of support for his family which consists of his wife, two children, and himself. He is 38 years old and has been growing coffee for more than 18 years.<br \/><br \/>Every day he experiments with new production techniques with the goal of increasing the quality and quantity of his crop without making any sacrifices. His principal aim is to make coffee growing more sustainable and environmentally sound after our bad treatment of the land. One type of production that greatly interests Am\u00edlcar is organic coffee which has better marketing possibilities than conventional ones. Also organic coffee is better for a healthy environment and animal biodiversity. For this reason he wishes to start converting his plantation to organic coffee so he will have 100% organic coffee.<br \/><br \/>Am\u00edcar is seeking a loan to start the conversion process to organic coffee without setting aside the practices of Comercio Justo y Rainforest.

It is known as a cattle zone in the province. A local attraction is the rodeo of the Montubian people of the coast that takes place  some times of the year. <br \/> <br \/>Juanita lives in Pajan. She is 56 years old, living in a civil union, and has two independent adult children.  Two grandchildren, ages six and eleven months, live with her. She cares for them because her daughter works outside the city. Her husband is a farmer. <br \/><br \/>Juanita and her husband and son have a business of buying and selling straw. They buy the straw from the farmers in raw form. Then they treat it appropriately to be able to sell it to local artisans of their city and other cities. The artisans use it to make hats, ornaments, and many other products that are valued by their customers, both national and foreign. The majority of the straw that they sell to the businessmen is then exported to Peru, where they are paid a very good price.

Her husband needs to purchase different types of clothes in bulk for resale purposes, but due to insufficient financial means he is unable to purchase these clothes. Therefore Musarat is applying for a Kiva loan from its field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that she can assist her husband in purchasing these clothes in bulk for his business. Her husband can also increase the size of his business and earn maximum profit with the help of this loan amount.<br \/><br \/>Musarat is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC

That name references the desire of the group members to succeed in their projects.  Most of the population works in agriculture, with corn fields stretching throughout the town.<br \/><br \/>Gerardo is a very hardworking man who is often smiling.  He is a responsible family man who tends to his wife and their four children.  All the effort of his work goes toward the welfare of his family, especially toward schooling for his children.<br \/><br \/>Eight years ago the couple decided to start visiting Mexico City to find better work opportunities.  Gera, as he is better known, began working as a mason and made good money.  However, the act of leaving his children for so long made him return to his community.  \"I never have liked working as a mason.  What I'm really passionate about is being behind the steering wheel,\" he says with a smile.<br \/><br \/>For that reason, once he returned, he began looking for work as a taxi driver.  Some time later, he found an opening and worked for six years as an employee.  Later, thanks to the savings he accumulated, he was able to buy a car and work for himself..  Since then he works every day starting very early, and is in the habit of treating his customers well, with a good attitude.<br \/><br \/>His effort and dedication are reflected in the economic stability of his family and his business.  Now, with the opportunities a loan presents, he will be able to invest in auto parts in addition to paying for his permits.  In the meantime, Aurelia supports him by working in cosmetic sales.  She is a consultant and has a base salary in addition to commissions.  They are both very pleased with and grateful to VF M\u00e9xico and Kiva, who have always had confidence in their work.<br \/><br \/>The other members of the group are Araceli who invests in pigs; Aurelia who invests in beauty products; and Simona who invests in sheep.<br \/><br \/>*The photograph was taken in town, next to Gerardo's taxi."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1748.39,"image":{"id":1966281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to invest in auto parts and pay for permits.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Miguel La Labor, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-09-09T00:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-09T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":2900,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gerardo ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Araceli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":49000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5634.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":5767.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5904.82},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6044.89},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6188.29},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":6335.09},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":6485.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6639.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.46},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.37},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":349.47},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":357.76},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":366.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":374.93},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":383.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":392.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":674.86,"local_amount":11402.89,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:58:56Z","rounded_local_amount":11445.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204552},{"amount":1073.53,"local_amount":18138.91,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":18206.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291975}],"funded_date":"2015-09-10T01:03:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Hiller","image":null}},{"id":944201,"name":"Cheryl","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cheryl is 44 years old and is married with five children.

She has had a grocery shop for thirteen years and recently she opened a business where she prepares and sells sandwiches.  <br \/><br \/>This time, she is requesting a loan from VFMexico and Kiva in order to supply in part her grocery shop and the other part to buy ingredients that are used in the preparation of sandwiches.  On another front, she tends a school supply shop where she spends most of her day while her daughter-in-law looks after the other businesses.  As previously mentioned, she is very grateful for the loan since for various cycles they have trusted her and supported her in the best way.<br \/>  <br \/>The other members of the group are Alejandro, Maria Martina, Lucia, and Maria Elena, who invest in sheep; Luisa, in clothing; and Patricia, in a grocery shop.<br \/><br \/>* The photograph was taken on the steps of the municipal pavilion.  Cristina is the one dressed in a sweater and a black skirt."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2362.5,"image":{"id":1966461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies for the preparation of food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Rioyos Buenavista, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-09-09T00:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-09T00:50:04Z","loan_amount":4725,"lender_count":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuela Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandro ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1181.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1181.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1181.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1181.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1181.25,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:58:58Z","rounded_local_amount":20033.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204555},{"amount":1181.25,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":20033.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291978}],"funded_date":"2015-09-10T00:20:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Livingston Sutro","image":null}},{"id":944207,"name":"Melde","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melde is 49 years old and married.<br \/><br \/>Melde is in the agricultural business, raising pigs in the Philippines.

Fadil is 29 years old, married with two kids, and lives in Yatta in Hebron city. Fadil has a small stockade in front of his house. His main business is to trade in livestock, such as goats, sheep, ewes, etc. Fadil needs the loan to buy sheep and ewes in order to raise them and then sell them and make some profits.

","en":"Rahimjon was born and grew up in the city of Isfara.  He is 26 years old, married, with two children.  For the past few years, he and his team have been involved in construction and home repairs.  Thanks to this activity, he makes a decent income, and his family is not lacking anything.  However, Rahimjon's family has been struck by misfortune.  While he was cutting grass, Rahimjon's little brother, Naimjon, got a foreign body into his eye.  His eye became inflamed and he eventually started to lose his vision.  In order to have his vision restored, Naimjon needs a costly operation, which can only be done in Russia.  It is with great hope that Raimjon is turning to you for some support.  He looks forward to receiving this loan so that his brother can be cured."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":128,"image":{"id":1968502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Health"],"use":"For

She enjoys cleaning and taking care of things, which is the reason why she chose this activity.  Not everyone knows how to do that well.
