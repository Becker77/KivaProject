She lives in northern Israel and runs a small daycare center in the village where she lives. Arin was trained and worked as a teacher's aide in special education but she wanted to take her love of children and education and apply it to small children. Arin decided to open up her daycare center and worked with the municipality to meet standards and gain approval to be a municipal day care. The children and payment come from the municipality so she has a promised income each month. Arin has gained an excellent reputation in her village among the parents who appreciate her care and respect of their children. Arin has also taken steps to develop a relationship between the parents so the children become a strong group during the time they are under her care.\r\n\r\nArin needed this loan for supplies and to order stock and prepare her daycare. With this loan, she is assured her daycare has access to the needed supplies.\r\n\r\nIn the future Arin wants to expand her daycare, hire staff and take on the care of more

Then, as the only breadwinner, she had to find ways of supporting the family financially. Three years ago she and her oldest son spent their small savings on the purchase of a very first calf.

For Sobeida, her sewing business and sales of \"salchipapas\" (sausage and french fries) have been a source of income that has enabled her to contribute to the household expenses.  As a seamstress, she makes bed sheets and bedspreads, and at night sells salchipapas off her front porch.  She has been in business for nearly a year ,and it has done well enough for her to generate a good profit.  What she enjoys most about her job is being able to talk to the customers.  The greatest challenge she has is having to go out early to buy the ingredients for her food sales.  In the future she would like to renovate her home and set up a larger workshop.

He has lived with his spouse for 10 years and together they are raising three children under 8. This family lives in the Santo Domingo neighborhood in the Tapo district. Walter works in agriculture on cropland located in his own community. He plants peas, beans and potatoes, products that he sells on market days in the wholesalers' market in Tama. His crops sell right away and most are taken to the city of Lima for buyers who travel to that area. In this way, he has been able to support his young family and give his children a decent education in their community's school. \" It's good to work the earth, but there are days with losses too. For example, 5 years ago, I lost 2 hectares of potatoes due to frost\", he explains. He notes that thanks to that problem he learned to take care of his crops more tenaciously. Walter hopes to in time expand his land and plants more crops. He also wants to give his young children the education that he, due to lack of money, had no access to. \"My children are the most valuable thing I can have. For them I will keep working\", he remarks. This would be his 8th loan with MFP. For this is reason, he is committed to making his payments on time. At the same time, he is grateful to the organization and to his communal bank for the growth opportunity they have shown him along the way.

He is 57 years old, is married and has 8 children. He has a specialized secondary education.  He is a professional driver and also is engaged in animal husbandry. He buys young calves, feeds them for 40-45 days and then sells them at higher price, since grown calves are cost more and are used for meat. He then buys another set of young calves, feeds them and resells them. This is his business, which helps him to provide for his family, since he is a sole breadwinner of the family.  Besides that, the development of stock-raising business allows to supply nearby markets with fresh meat at affordable prices. Safar has been in this business for about 20 years. He wants to use the proceeds of his loan to purchase several calves. He plans to repay his loan within 12 months.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Keith & Jamilya Leitich, Kiva Volunteers. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u041d\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0435\u0432

This is 27-year-old Happy R. from Mbeya. She is married and has two children, ages 4 and 7. Happy has established a store that sells traditional clothing called kanga and vitenge, which is worn by Tanzanian women. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. \r\n\r\nHappy buys the clothing wholesale and resells it at retail prices. She works at the business for 12 hours a day, 6 days a week and is assisted by her husband. She currently earns about $300 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD to purchase additional stock of kanga and vitenge. Happy thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History <br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a middle woman in the rice business. Her husband, Mr. Huong Soeu, is a farmer who owns a plot of land to cultivate rice to earn a living. On this plantation, he faces an obstacle because he does not have money to pay for plowing.

He is 59, married, and the father of 10 children whose ages he doesn't remember.  Three of his children go to school.  He only studied through 4th grade of the old education system and didn't continue due to the lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home with his family and also supports 2 grandchildren that live with him.<p>\r\nHe left Marracuene for the district of Boane many years ago with his family in search of better living conditions.  He has worked as a heavy equipment operator in a quarry since 1961 and makes a monthly salary of 4,600 meticais.  He uses this money to pay for his family's expenses and still saves some at his house.  His wife sells basic products as a way of increasing their family's income. <p>\r\nHe has never had a loan with another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through friends.  This is his 3rd loan, and it is for 10,000 meticais.  He will use it to purchase construction materials (iron, cement, sand, etc) to finish building his home.  His previous loans were for 5,000 and 10,000 meticais and were used for his business and his home, respectively.<p>\r\nIn the future, he would like to request more laons to finish his home and to offer more comfort to his family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

V., Cauayan City, Isabela. She is 38 years old. Luzviminda is the group leader of a seven-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luzviminda is married and has seven school-aged children. To earn a living, Luzviminda owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling fruits and vegetables in the local community. Luzviminda is just starting this business.<\/p>\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Luzviminda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Luzviminda is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Luzviminda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\n<p><strong>About ASKI:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

old, single, and has no children. Her intentions are to maintain her business activity, after having struggled a great deal to overcome on some level, the most difficult obstacles of her life, to continue on living. Her wishes are also to make sure her products are of quality so that her clients continue coming to her in search of her products. Given that her block has a lot of competition and she doesn\u2019t want to lose the habit of selling bread, especially because it is a product that is part of neighborhood tradition. Her dream is to buy a new house so that her mother and she may live comfortably in adequate conditions for their wellbeing, because her age demands that she prepare for the future.\r\n\r\nHer economic activity is the sale of nacatamales (a Central American Tamal), bread, and soda. The location of her business is in her house. She has had it for 24 years. Do\u00f1a \u00c1gueda started her business for her mother, who was initially responsible for the business. As time passed, the quality of her mother\u2019s tamales captured the attention of many clients, and the business had a great deal of success, and her mother decided to place her daughter in charge of the business. She taught her how to make the tamales so that the change of management wouldn\u2019t affect the business. Since she has maintained her mother\u2019s original clientele, and so that she doesn\u2019t lose her business, the loan will be used to buy more products, like pots, corn, bread, and sodas.  She has always enjoyed working with Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 and their sister organizations that desire to help people that truly want to progress with their businesses.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matt Capetola, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":252928,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more products for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-11T06:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agueda De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":909.09},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":909.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.73},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.73,"local_amount":909.09,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":945.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399973},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":1269.43,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1320.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091971},{"amount":28.8,"local_amount":548.75,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":570.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985355},{"amount":84.11,"local_amount":1602.04,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1666.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445971},{"amount":41.54,"local_amount":791.31,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":823.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956612},{"amount":256.17,"local_amount":4879.38,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T22:53:48Z","rounded_local_amount":5076.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174040}],"funded_date":"2009-01-11T20:20:07Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T22:53:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Capetola","image":null}},{"id":87079,"name":"Yolanda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ms Yolanda A.( the lady in the left) is 49 years old, married to a carpenter and has 3 children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She learned how to be a salesperson years ago from her aunt, and has been doing it for the past 12 years, selling several products at a convenience store. She has no employees.  She makes approximately 4.500,00MT (U$ 170) per month.

C'est pour cette raison que Marguerite sollicite un quatri\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit. ","en":"Marguerite D. was born in 1969 in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin. Married to S\u00e9v\u00e9rin Zinsou, Marguerite is the mother of six children, all of whom are at school. But two of the children are no longer with the couple. The family has lived in the N\u2019Venamede district of Cotonou for almost 15 years. Both she and her husband take care of the family expenses.  To meet her needs, Marguerite sells fruit juice (lemon juice, hibiscus juice, etc.) at a school in the Suru-L\u00e9r\u00e9 district of Cotonou. As a secondary business, Marguerite sells \u201cbouillie\u201d (a type of porridge made from corn starch).  Marguerite buys her products in Dantokpa, Benin's international market. Marguerite has been running this business for about 10 years and has previously obtained three loans from ALID\u00e9, all of which she repaid. Marguerite has since experienced a drop in sales and now wants to boost her business and take a bigger share of the market. This is why Marguerite is requesting a fourth loan. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":543895,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy sugar, hibiscus, lemons, etc. to make fruit juice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-05-23T00:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marguerite ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:40:33Z","rounded_local_amount":15651.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144653484},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:28:51Z","rounded_local_amount":15651.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835696},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":15651.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159576093},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:15:05Z","rounded_local_amount":15651.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954607},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-30T08:51:22Z","rounded_local_amount":15651.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056264},{"amount":30,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-27T10:03:01Z","rounded_local_amount":15651.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347799},{"amount":36,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":18781.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482842},{"amount":32,"local_amount":16000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-05T09:06:56Z","rounded_local_amount":16694.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617651},{"amount":36.82,"local_amount":18411,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:09:07Z","rounded_local_amount":19210.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191361052},{"amount":15.18,"local_amount":7589,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":7918.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779753}],"funded_date":"2010-05-23T14:54:45Z","paid_date":"2011-03-28T09:13:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Llewellyn","image":44015}},{"id":206741,"name":"Khlok","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Khlok P. is 32 years old and lives in Angk Svay Chek village in Takeo province.

Nilda's crops are some of the best cared-for in the town of Patay (in the Tarma province).  She grows potatoes, peas and lettuce that are of very good quality, since she has been responsible about applying organic fertilizer to her fields.  In the market of Tarma, where she sells her products, the customers seek out her crops, because she always has a good price for them.  What she likes most about her job is the harvest season, since at that time she feels that the months of hard work are rewarded.  She has been farming for 10 years.  What she considers most difficult is to protect her crops from insect infestations.  Over time, she plans to buy a stall in the wholesale market, so that she can increase her income.  This is her 8th loan with MFP, and she has always been very punctual with her payments, since she feels that she has a commitment to the institution.

After purchasing his cattle, Amir provides them with all the right conditions for their growth: taking care of their food and protection and making sure they don\u2019t get lost. Once they\u2019re fully mature, Amir sells them in his area and also provides their milk for sale. Currently he needs to purchase cattle to raise and is turning to IMON International to obtain a loan of 5,000 Somoni for this reason. Amir thanks Kiva for the support that Kiva presents to small entrepreneurs.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Sarah has already received and successfully repaid one loan, and now requires a new loan in order to buy more rice, onion, vegetable oil, salt and maggi for her business. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 300,000. In the future, Sarah plans to improve the business to a store. She hopes to see her business grow to a level of making more profit, to take care of her children's education. It serves the general public. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":927536,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To pay for cooking condiments such as rice, onion, vegetable oil, salt and maggi for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Bo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2011-11-25T05:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":510625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250721832},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:40:21Z","rounded_local_amount":510625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257124741},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:49:15Z","rounded_local_amount":510625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505647},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:15Z","rounded_local_amount":510625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974753},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:13:55Z","rounded_local_amount":510625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815321},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":510625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444378},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:01:58Z","rounded_local_amount":510625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537110},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:18Z","rounded_local_amount":510625,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294284601}],"funded_date":"2011-11-29T14:24:01Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":366588,"name":"Ukulima Mbele Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Receive greetings from Ukulima Mbele Group in Western Kenya!

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called pasals, are an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

She lives with her husband and four children in Kaboila I Natien, in the center of the city of Sikasso (the third administrative region of Mali). After having tried many business activities without success, over 15 years ago Mrs. Kadia S. decided to start cooking food for sale. She sells by their family home, in front of the former Regional Office for Social Affairs, every day.  Her business is very popular with customers because of the high quality of her products.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet the growing customer demand, over four years ago she decided to turn ot the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution. After several solidarity loans (group loans) under the auspices of the local women\u2019s association, she is now on her 11th individual loan. All her prior loans have been duly repaid.\r\n\r\nWith this 11th loan, she plans to buy five bags of potatoes, five packs of \u201cMaggi\u201d bouillon cubes, three jugs of vinegars, 40 packs of \u201cattieke\u201d (a traditional manioc-based dish), 35 kg of beef, 50 kg of fresh fish, five liters of vegetable oil, three bags of charcoal, bread loaves, plantains etc. She buys her wares locally and sells for cash and on credit to a customer base composed generally of young (unmarried) people, mostly vendors, as she is based near the area where cereal warehouses are located. She plans to achieve a monthly income of 300,000 West African Francs, which will be used mainly for covering family expenses and paying the interest on her loan, with the rest reinvested in her business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":766403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase ingredients for her food-serving business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-05-12T03:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":71428.57},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":71428.57},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":71428.57},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":71428.57},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":71428.57},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":71428.57},{"due_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":71428.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.14},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.15},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.14},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.14},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":157.14},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.15},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":157.14,"local_amount":71428.57,"processed_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:19Z","rounded_local_amount":71609.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301553},{"amount":157.15,"local_amount":71428.57,"processed_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:52:08Z","rounded_local_amount":71609.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216581135},{"amount":157.14,"local_amount":71428.57,"processed_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:22Z","rounded_local_amount":71609.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750892},{"amount":157.14,"local_amount":71428.57,"processed_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:45Z","rounded_local_amount":71609.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120199},{"amount":157.14,"local_amount":71428.57,"processed_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":71609.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232882052},{"amount":157.15,"local_amount":71428.57,"processed_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:14Z","rounded_local_amount":71609.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699147},{"amount":157.14,"local_amount":71428.58,"processed_date":"2011-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:29Z","rounded_local_amount":71609.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655417}],"funded_date":"2011-05-12T22:14:38Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":301008,"name":"New Hope Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Para la formaci\u00f3n D. presente comit\u00e9, tuvo el inicio la Se\u00f1ora Norma D. km. 9 Acaray de Ciudad D.

","en":"Maria Alejandra graduated from the Carlos Pizarro Leon Gomez High School in 2011 and since then, she has been deciding what she can do to achieve her goal of studying something related to health care.  She had plenty of ideas, but finally decided to study health administration because she liked it a lot and it offers lots of job opportunities.  She overcame a few difficulties and she is now studying on a course to be a health care assistant.  She always wants to be able to help her community.\r\n\r\nShe has always been a nice person who is friendly and attentive to all people, no matter who they are.  She is especially fond of her family, who have worked hard to raise her; even when it has been hard they have always tried to do their best for her.  She would like to repay them for all they have done.\r\nShe has had her dream on hold for a while, due to some difficulties which have arisen, but in all this time, she has never stopped believing in her desire to be a health professional.  This will allow her to help her family through hard times, too.  She knows that the passion she has for what she does will allow to achieve her goals little by little.  She is very ambitious and will not give in.  She is not in a very good financial situation at the moment, so she is asking for a loan from Kiva to help with her monthly payments.  This will help her to finish studying what she loves the most.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1555084,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for a semester on her course.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":244,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":435000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000},{"due_date":"2014-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":145000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.34},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Walker","image":1333070}},{"id":1071,"name":"Shani","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shani lives in the Kigogo area of Dar es Salaam.

His great desire is to see his children get a good education, as so far he has not been able to afford that privilege. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\nHace cinco a\u00f1os, en la ciudad de Chinandega, para poder mantener a sus 3 hijos y a su anciano padre, el se\u00f1or Juan B. inicia un negocio de transporte o com\u00fanmente llamado acarreo el cual consiste en el traslado de art\u00edculos o materiales de diferentes naturalezas de una lugar a otro.

She lives in her own home with her 4 children: Carol, 12, Yenifer, 8, Jefer, 4, and Yoselin, 3. They are the motivation behind all of her efforts. With this in mind, she raises cattle with care and dedication. Her day begins at 5 in the morning when she takes her cows out to pasture in the fields in order to keep them well-fed and strong, which is what her business depends on. Marleny takes her cattle to her city's Sunday market, where she is able to sell them quickly and at a good price.\r\nWhat Marleny likes the best about her job is walking among the vast fields, where she takes her cows to graze daily. She has been doing this work for 5 years. The most difficult part is getting the cows to the market to sell.\r\nShe hopes that in time she will be able to increase the number of cows she has and thereby increase her income. This is her second loan through MFP, and she pledges to make her repayments on time. As Marleny is a very responsible and orderly person, she does not want anyone who is a part of her community bank to be penalized.

She has operated the business for more than 10 years and it is her only source of income.  Lidia has 4 children who also depend on her income.  It's for them that she works hard, going every day to the port where she can buy supplies of seafood for relatively little so that she, in turn, can offer the best prices to her customers.

Moinposho is 41 years old and has three children. She is an experienced businesswoman and a well-known seamstress in her community, where she has provided tailoring services for more than 15 years. She is pleased to have a well-established clientele, which consists mostly of parents of school-age children, but also adds new clients regularly. Moinposho has been an active and strongly-motivated client of IMON since 2006, and her credit history makes her eligible to receive new and larger loans. With his in mind, she has applied for a loan of 6,500 Somoni to buy new fabric with which she will sew dresses. Moinposho and her family wish to express their gratitude for your generosity and support.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Su credikiva es el tercer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo con el cual comprar\u00e1 insumos al por mayor, para la preparaci\u00f3n de sus alimentos y utensilios de cocina, con los cuales ofrecer\u00e1 un mejor servicio a sus clientes y mejorar\u00e1 el sistema de compras, accediendo a mejores precios por vol\u00famenes; con sus cr\u00e9ditos anteriores, se increment\u00f3  ligeramente su capital de trabajo y aumentaron sus ingresos. Su meta m\u00e1s adelante es adecuar su vivienda en condiciones favorables para vivir m\u00e1s c\u00f3modamente. Mientras Emelide trabaja para conseguir su sue\u00f1o  genera en su negocio una utilidad no menor del 20% que planea aumentar, en la medida en que su clientela contin\u00fae creciendo.","en":"Emelide sells lunches, specifically soups and basic fast food that is very well prepared.  Her main customers are her neighbors and the workers who daily go by her business, which is located in her own house.  Customs have changed and many people no longer cook in their home, but rather they buy small portions of the delicious stews that Emelide prepares.  This is the source of lunch for many families because it is economical, and so this business is a \"win-win\" situation for Emelide and her customers.  Emelide sells daily on a cash basis, and she also buys her ingredients each day for her daily sales.  With her business she has managed to generate an important income to help support her household, which is comprised of her husband and their two children aged 30 and 37.  Her Kiva loan is the 3rd loan that she has taken from the  Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, and she will use the loan to buy supplies at wholesale to make her food, and to buy cooking utensils.  This way she will offer better service to her customers and will improve her system of purchasing, as she will get better prices by buying in bulk.  With her previous loans, she increased her working capital a bit and increased her income.  Her goal for the future is to fix up her home to provide more comfortable living conditions.  While Emelide works to achieve her dream, her business generates profit no less than 20%, which she plans to increase as her customer base continues to grow.

its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He always dreamed to have his own land and a lot of cattle to create his own farm. For more than seven years he has been in this business and tries to expand it. He is married and is a loving father of five children. The income which he receives from the business is spent on the needs of his family and expansion of the business. Abduahad wants to receive a loan in the amount of $3000USD to buy cattle, mineral fertilizer and fuel and lubricants. He thanks all of you in advance for your help and charity.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule.

C. is from the town of Plaridel. She is 21 years old and married. To make a living, Maricel runs a food stall. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Maricel has been engaged in her business for more than a year and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maricel joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maricel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. Maricel is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be the second loan taken out by Maricel from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Julius has been engaged in his business for over seven years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) when he sells one of his raised animals.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Julius joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Julius has successfully repaid a previous loan of 17,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. \r\n\r\nJulius is requesting a new loan of 24,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies.

They have four milk cows and produce traditional Georgian cheese. Tsinadzes always have cheese clients, because they produce quality cheese. Also, the family owns a 1 hectare plot of the land.
