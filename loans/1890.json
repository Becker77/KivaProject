This is Bernard. He is the Head teacher of Denita School, a mixed school in the Urban area of Gayaza in Wakiso with 300 students. Denita School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nDenita School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Bernard ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1973217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Wakiso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-09-09T15:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-09T15:50:14Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Denita Children's Centre School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3035000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":607000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-09-09T20:23:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":944849,"name":"Gregoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cLOS ANGELES\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\nLa socia es la Sra.

She has experienced many challenges within the past few years, and raising her children on her own has been a difficult journey. During these troubled times, Margarita\u2019s resourcefulness, positivity and determination have helped her overcome these challenges. \n\nMargarita\u2019s marriage ended abruptly, forcing her to suddenly have to support her household on only one income.  As she readjusted her life she did her best to pay all of her bills while downsizing and making her household budget more manageable. Unfortunately, for a few months, her household expenses were simply overwhelming, and she could not keep up with them. This caused major damage to her credit as most of the bills were in her name only. Margarita did not give up. She was able to bring all of her bills current, but due to the multiple late payments her credit was damaged. She now wants to finance a new air conditioning unit for her home with affordable payments. \n\nMargarita and her family are in desperate need of a new air conditioning unit while Florida experiences above average temperatures and in her home it is often hotter than outdoors. The current unit is no longer functional, and contains a large amount of mold, which is greatly affecting the health of her children.

On a rented land plot of 0.70 hectares, she cultivates corn for on-farm consumption and sale. \n\nTazhihan's monthly income is about 16,000 som (KGS), and this amount is disastrously insufficient for a satisfactory life. Thus she has decided to develop her business and has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) to buy cows for breeding.

Like Julieta, a loyal partner of CCT for almost 7 years now, who has always been dedicated to growing and improving her mini-variety store year after year. She may have experienced ups and downs while operating her store, but discouragement has no place to break the strong-willed person within her.\r\n\r\nThe love for family consistently drives her to keep going and move forward toward her dreams. She has been running her business for six fruitful years already, and by carefully meeting the demand of customers, Julieta was able to gain more patrons and significantly increased her profit. As of today, her net earnings add up to almost PHP 12,000 per month, and she expects to further increase them in the next few years.\r\n\r\nJulieta is again knocking on the door of your generous hearts to make this happen. She needs additional capital to stock her store with a wide array of new products from which her neighbouring customers can choose. She would buy assorted groceries, beverages and toiletries that are usually needed by families within their community. A loan amounting to PHP 35,000 will suffice for this, and she is thanking you in advance for whatever amount you will lend her.\r\n\r\nShe never stops looking for ways to improve their living condition. Aside from her variety store, Julieta now has her own pre-paid loading station for cellular telephone users and she also operates a 10-seater jeepney unit, both of which help add income for her family. She was able to sustain their daily needs and expenses, and these additional sources of income are a big help also for her husband, Lordjim, who is working abroad.\r\n\r\nJulieta still regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups, each composed of 15 to 30 community partners, that gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":343.75,"image":{"id":1558643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items, toiletries and beverages needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-09-09T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-09T18:40:03Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julieta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":343.75,"local_amount":16041.63,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":16146.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045471}],"funded_date":"2015-10-02T14:25:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":929494,"name":"Cecilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cecilyn is 33 years old and lives in Calamba, Misamis Occidental.

De igual forma, siempre est\u00e1 dispuesto a ayudar a quien lo necesita y este valor lo ha transmitido a toda su familia integrada por su esposa Maribel y sus cinco hijos.\n   Desde hace treinta a\u00f1os se ha dedicado a las ventas de art\u00edculos para habitaci\u00f3n como almohadas, colchas, sabanas y edredones. Para \u00e9l las ventas son una pasi\u00f3n y ofrece su mercanc\u00eda de puerta en puerta; al inicio s\u00f3lo cerca de su localidad y actualmente en comunidades aleda\u00f1as. No obstante, desde hace 18 a\u00f1os adquiri\u00f3 un local en donde exhibe su mercanc\u00eda, \u201cahora, con mi puesto seguro, no me canso y los clientes pueden observar mejor los productos\u201d coment\u00f3. \n   Sin embargo, para dar variedad a su negocio, ha decidido adquirir productos de bisuter\u00eda y art\u00edculos de papeler\u00eda ya que en esta temporada son muy solicitados entre los alumnos de las distintas escuelas. La inversi\u00f3n inicial la piensa realizar con el pr\u00e9stamo solicitado a VFM\u00e9xico por lo que se encuentra muy entusiasmado y alegre. \n   Afortunadamente cada vez que inicia con una actividad obtiene buenos resultados a pesar de la competencia que suele aparecer. Por ahora su principal meta es trabajar m\u00e1s fuerte para continuar ayudando a su hija con el objetivo de que se gradu\u00e9 como educadora deportiva. Una meta secundaria es cultivar la extensi\u00f3n de tierra que conserva,  \u201cson  tres hect\u00e1reas y cuando me toca sembrar, regar, cosechar o cualquier otra actividad son gastos fuertes para m\u00ed\u201d dijo. \n   Al igual que Don Pedro los otros integrantes de su grupo se encuentran contentos con los beneficios del cr\u00e9dito. Ellos son: Martha Lilia quien invertir\u00e1 en productos de jarcer\u00eda; Catalina, en boneter\u00eda y mercer\u00eda e Isain en productos pl\u00e1sticos. Cabe mencionar que todos viven en una comunidad muy tranquila del Estado de M\u00e9xico, llena de vegetaci\u00f3n y panor\u00e1micamente inigualable ya que es adornada por arboles enormes.\n* La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en el quiosco del municipio, Don Pedro es quien viste el chaleco negro.\n","en":"Don Pedro is a person who was raised in the fields. Because of that his profession is a characteristic that he shares with his neighbors. Likewise, he is always ready to help whoever needs it and he has passed on this value to his whole family, which includes his wife Maribel and his five children.\n\nFor the past 30 years, he has earned a living by selling bedroom items such as pillows, bedspreads, sheets, and quilts. To him, selling is a passion and he offers his merchandise from door to door, initially only close to his town and now in adjoining communities. However, 18 years ago he acquired a shop where he displays his merchandise. \"Now, with my secure stand, I do not become tired and the clients can better see the products,\" he said.\n\nTo diversify his business, however, he has decided to acquire costume jewelry products and stationary because in this season they are often requested by students from the various schools. He plans to fulfill the initial investment with the loan requested from VFMexico, through which he has become very enthusiastic and happy.\n\nFortunately, every time he begins a business, he gets good results in spite of the competition that appears. For now, his principal goal is working harder to continue helping his daughter with the objective of graduating as a sports teacher. A secondary goal is cultivating the stretch of land he looks after. \"There are 3 hectares and when it is my turn to sow, water, harvest, or any other activity, they are great expenses for me,\" he said.\n\nLike Don Pedro, the other group members are content with the benefits of the loan. They are: Martha Lilia, who will invest in cleaning products; Catalina, in sewing supplies and haberdashery; and Isain is in plastic products. It is fitting to mention that they all live in a peaceful community in the State of Mexico, filled with vegetation and panoramas that are unparalleled because it is adorned with enormous trees.\n\n*The photograph was taken at the municipal pavilion.

This time, he will invest specifically in sheep. The raising can take several months because he obtains the animals when they are very small to ensure their healthy growth and to provide the best quality to his clients. \"I normally offer the animals to butchers or to people who are having a party,\" said Don Felipe, who has clients in and outside his town. When there are birds in the pen, he is proud to have the best examples of turkeys which are ordered a lot for Christmas. Likewise, his hens produce a reasonable quantity of eggs with which he grows his income. For now, his goal is to save enough for when he decides to retire, so that when that moment arrives he will be able to make a living with an activity that requires less effort.\n\nThe other members of the group are Jos\u00e9, who invests in sheets, blankets, etc., and Hortensia who works with sheep.\n\n*The photograph was taken on the stairs exactly in the center of the municipality.

Currently, she earns 4,000 INR per month from her livelihood, which is used for the monthly household expenses. Kamala has a three-acre farming area where she produces mushrooms and vegetables and sells them in the market.

By taking into consideration the drought problem in certain regions, mushroom production could help soil and water conservation too.<br \/><br \/>Kamala wants to take farming land on rent so that she can produce more mushrooms and vegetables. For this, she along with her group member is requesting a loan amount of 30,000 INR. <br \/><br \/>Kamala says, \u201cI am sure that with the financial assistance received from Kiva's partner, Peoples Forum, my family's needs can be met and even I can expand my business.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1973756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to rent farming land to produce more mushrooms and vegetables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Semliguda, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2015-09-10T05:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-10T05:50:06Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kamala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haribala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-09-11T16:20:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":944727,"name":"Jay Maa Sarada Shg-A Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sumitra, 37, standing in the middle in the photograph, is the featured borrower of Jay Maa Sarada Shg-A Group.

Here, the community - men but mostly women - wear their beautiful traditional clothing. The hamlet is the home of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cMujeres Los Morales\u201d with its eight very dedicated and hardworking members whose small businesses consist of creating their traditional beautiful textiles to sell. Some of the members are also famers.  <br \/><br \/>One of the members of \u201cMujeres Los Morales\u201d is 35-year-old Susana, who is married with four children. She and her husband are farmers whose crops, thankfully, are supporting their children.  Susana needs to request a loan in order to buy seeds and fertilizers for their crops of carrots, potatoes and cabbage which are grown on their 3 to 4 acres of land.<br \/><br \/>Like most of the 22,000 clients of Friendship Bridge, Susana never had the opportunity to have a formal education. She is very grateful for the monthly Trust Bank meetings where the Facilitator provides educational topics with drawings, role playing and photos. Each month a new important topic that the women can use in their daily lives is provided. These topics range from good business practices like bookkeeping, investing, savings, customer service and marketing to women\u2019s and children\u2019s health.

In order to further grow her business, Kanykei is once more taking a loan from Bai Tushum.  She has requested 40,000 som (KGS) to buy a few additional calves and increase her livestock headcount.

She also occasionally sews wedding decorations whenever she gets orders. <br \/><br \/>Bessie is a hardworking 31-year-old mother. She wishes to build a better future for her three children.

This is James. He is the Head teacher of Bateefu School, a mixed school in the Urban area of Mutundwe in Kampala district with 360 students. Bateefu School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nBateefu School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. James ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1973213,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-09-10T13:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-10T13:40:08Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bateefu Primary School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3035000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":607000},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":607000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-09-10T20:14:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":944363,"name":"Samuel's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther, 52, is married and has a cheerful family of one school age child.

She has two dependent children, one of whom is in school and the other one is under the age of school. In order to support the living, she along with her husband has been growing cassava and working for others for a fee to supplement income. They have been doing their farming business for seven years, earning about USD14 a day and saving approximately about USD5.

On one occasion a sheep gave birth to twins, but we had to help her.  And so her twins were born and we were able to do it thanks to the techniques that we learned in training,\" says Lucy, happily.  Lucy, in addition to the previous experience, has also taken different courses on animal care and nutrition.<br \/><br \/>She is very happy and grateful to VF M\u00e9xico.

The previous loans, she has household supplies for her family\u2019s uses. She is now applying for a loan in order to buy fertilizer to produce good yield. She hopes that this fifth loan will help her to get high yield to earn more income so that she can expand her current business and send children to school as well."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1974265,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to
