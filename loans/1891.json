With no access to a toilet, her family has to walk long distances to answer nature's call in private: in dense bushes or isolated fields.

tremendous. She combines all income generating ventures that she knows to help her driver husband, Rogine, earn a living. She runs a variety store, sells frozen foods, retails cellphone load, and buys scrap once in a while. She wants to earn and save enough to ensure the future and education of her two small children. \r\n\r\nThey are living in Bacolod City, the capital city of Negros Occidental. It\u2019s a prolific city for many businesses as many schools, offices, and entertainment places flourish in the area. This is why Jessica was encouraged to run all these enterprises. She still longs to improve her business by borrowing additional capital worth PHP 14,000 which she can use to buy more supplies for her variety store and additional chicken meat, pork, hotdogs and sausages. She plans to set aside some money for her cellphone e-loading and scrap businesses.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nHope Christian School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

This is Bosco. He is the Deputy Head teacher of Kashaka Girls Secondary School, a girls school in the rural area of Kashaka in Mbarara with 850 students. Kashaka Girls School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 1,000 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Kashaka Girls School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

The Christ statue is at the top of the hill, and the mountain peak of Orizaba and the sunrise are unequaled, as the day labourers head out to the fields with their supplies. <br \/>In this community there is a group called \"Las Cafeteras\" which is made up of five women, whose main occupation is selling coffee. They are: Amanda and Rosa who also sell clothing, Magdalena, who sells coffee, Mar\u00eda, who sells groceries and Patricia who sells typical food. <br \/>Magdalena is known in the community as Magda and is married to Jos\u00e9 Luis, with whom she has 4 children who are economically dependant on their parents. Her husband is descendant from a family that produced coffee. His grandfather was the owner of a factory where the bean was put through a series of processes to obtain the final product, that is, delicious organic coffee that is free from chemicals.  <br \/>Magda incorporated the coffee business into the marriage and 6 years ago they became independent and created their own brand. Today their farm consists of more than 2000 coffee trees, and they use the whole product, including the shell and leaves which are used in an organic fertilizer.  The process to obtain the final product consists of drying the beans, toasting them carefully to get a good smell and taste, grinding them, packaging and sealing them and labelling them in bags of different sizes. \"The secret of good coffee is serving it not too cold and not too hot\" she pronounces with a big smile on her face while packaging the coffee. <br \/>The loans will be invested in buying bags and labels as well as a scale, a blender, and a sealer for the bags.

Most of the people in the town speak K\u2019iche with a small percentage who speak Spanish. The women of Camanchaj make gorgeous and exquisitely handmade textiles. Besides textiles, some women also make crafts and have animal husbandry businesses. <br \/><br \/>Camanchaj is the home of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cEstrellas de Camanchaj\u201d (Stars of Camanchaj) with its eight members, including the leader of this group, Josefa, who is 23 years old and has a two-year-old son. Her son is her inspiration for working hard in order to create a good future for them both. <br \/><br \/>Josefa weaves fabrics that she sells in her community. A couple of times a week, she goes to the market-place where she has a small shop to sell her fabrics. She is asking for a 29,600 GTQ loan to be apportioned among her group. With her share she will buy a large quantity of good-quality thread to weave more fabric. She would also like to buy some shawls, napkins and other finished products to sell in her shop. Josefa is grateful she has been able to obtain a loan through Friendship Bridge. <br \/><br \/>In Guatemala it is impossible for Maya women to borrow funds for their businesses. Kiva's field partner Friendship Bridge provides members microcredit and non-formal educations via their \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d program. During the monthly meetings, the Trust Bank Facilitator provides lessons in important subjects that the women can use on a daily basis. Very important for the development of their credit standings are business subjects like accounting, bookkeeping, sound investment practices, customer service and marketing. This is a win-win program that helps Josefa and the other 22,000 clients have a brighter future and for the women to provide good educations for their children. <br \/><br \/>Many thanks to the KIVA investors around the world who are helping the rural Maya women of Guatemala empower themselves and develop sound businesses. They are poised to step into a brighter future benefitting themselves, their families and their communities."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":321.19,"image":{"id":1974851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"buy

She started this business 10 years ago having bought five sheep and a bull. Thanks to her hard work, Sozulkan now owns 11 sheep. Her monthly income is 6,000 som (KGS). To develop her business further, Sozulkan turned to Bai-Tushum Bank for a loan of 25,000 som (KGS) to buy forage for livestock. The borrowed money will be of great help to prepare for the winter maintaining the head of livestock. Sozulkan is going to invest future income to increase the total number of livestock.

During the harvest time, the group sold the crops to a big buyer and earned a satisfactory profit. <br \/><br \/>Ni Nengah, as the head, feels the happiness of her group. She succeded in leading the group towards having an increasing profit and a better life. Its proven by the success of one of her group members who decided to resign after she earned a maximum profit and to continue the business with her own money. Three members need to increase their loan to expand their business. The new loan is being used to expand the farming business by buying new seeds, farming tools, insecticide and fertilizer.

Los amaneceres son inigualables en esa zona pues el volc\u00e1n conocido como el Pico de Orizaba brinda una vista esplendida en el horizonte. Aunque sin duda lo m\u00e1s agradable son los sonidos de la fauna local y las risas de los ni\u00f1os mientras juegan en el campo.\n   Los integrantes del grupo antes mencionado son: Yolanda quien invertir\u00e1 en refresco; Aracely, en ropa; Aidee y Francisca, en zapatos; Primitiva, en pan; Angelina, en botanas y pan, Vanessa, en abarrotes y Mar\u00eda quien brinda servicio de molino.\n   Mar\u00eda Santa es conocida por todos por su segundo nombre, tienen dos hijas que dependen econ\u00f3micamente de ella y su esposo Renaldo y son su gran motivaci\u00f3n en la vida.

The sunrises are unequaled in this zone because the volcano known as El Pico do Orizaba offers a splendid sight on the horizon. However, without a doubt, the most pleasant things are the sounds of the local animals and the laughter of the children while they play in the fields.\r\n\r\nThe members of the aforementioned group are: Yolanda, who will invest in soft drinks; Aracely, in clothing; Aldea and Francisco, in shoes; Primitiva, in bread; Angelina, in snacks and bread; Vanessa, in groceries; and Maria, who offers milling services.\r\n\r\nMaria Santa is known by everyone by her second name. She has two daughters who depend on her and her husband, Renaldo, economically and are her great motivation in life. In her previous neighborhood, there was no mill, and so the users had to go to a neighboring community to obtain this service. It was then that Santa found the opportunity to obtain advantageous income. With the help of her husband, she began 15 years ago to mill every type of grain and chiles, acquiring a solid customer base. \"At the beginning it was a little difficult to get up early. Now, without the need of setting an alarm, I get up and offer a quality service,\" she comments, satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe earnings have allowed her to build a small veranda next to the mill, where her customers line up while they wait their turn, since the number of customers is great, due above all to the custom of making tortillas by hand. An important key to the success of her business is the excellent attention that the customers receive, and they recommend Santa and come back soon.\r\n\r\nThe loan she has applied for will help her to buy a stone for the mill and a conveyer belt and to pay for services, thus continuing with the business that has benefited her family for 15 years.\r\n\r\nAll the group is grateful to Vision Fund Mexico and to Kiva for the loans granted, since each one of them has been able to strengthen her business.\r\n\r\nThe photograph was taken in the business of Do\u00f1a Angelina, who is happily holding her great-granddaughter.

The majority of its inhabitants work in the fields, in local sugar industries, and some have small businesses far and wide throughout the region.  <br \/><br \/>In one of the communities surrounded by hills, a group called Los Cuates was founded. Two twin brothers live in the house where the members meet. The members are: Obdulia, Irene, and Raquel, who sell chicken; Bernardina and Oscar, who sell soft drinks; Iran, who works in construction services; and Guadalupe, who buys and sells wood. <br \/><br \/>Do\u00f1a Obdulia is a very hard-working person. She has four children, two of which are economically dependent on her. She used to work as a housekeeper; however, this took away time with her children, which is why she decided to give up her housekeeping job. She then began selling chicken. \"I remember that I only bought ten chickens out of fear that I wouldn't be able to sell them because of the competition here, but thanks to friendly behavior, quality and accessible prices, I was able to sustain my endeavor,\" she tells us with satisfaction. Every day she wakes up at 5 AM to begin her routine, in which she prepares the animals for sale. Then she has breakfast with her children and takes them to school. When she returns, she opens her business. <br \/><br \/>The income has allowed her to cover household expenses, the education of her children, and business expenses. With this loan she will be able to buy 20 chickens, plastic bags, and a bucket. One of her plans for the future is to increase production and become a wholesaler within her community.<br \/><br \/>All of  the members would like to say, \"Thank you for the opportunity for growth that you have provided, and thank you for caring about us.

And there is nothing that could be more complex than a human psyche, because it is neither  calculated by a formula nor it is a subject to laws. I realized that studying psychology involves constant work, which is hard, and requires a lot of self-study and effort.\nI would have been now a sophomore, if I had entered AUCA last year. Unfortunately, last year due to limited finances and due to the lack of other sources of funding for my education, I went to study to another local university. But soon I realized that I had made a great mistake of my life. I visited AUCA again at AUCA Open Doors, and understood that it is a modern and dynamic educational system, timely responsive to labor market requirements. Education is provided in English, there are well-experienced professors who seek to convey their deep knowledge, an incredible combination of rigid self-discipline and flexibility in the choice of subjects, and a rich library.\nThat day we were told about financial aid and Kiva loan to cover the part of tuition. I was so upset to learn about it so late, but became so happy to find the reply for my question. From that day I started preparing for the AUCA entrance exams and believed that if I just pass the exams successfully, I will get an interest free loan and repay it back just after graduation. My parents supported me morally and now I am again a freshman, but this time at the university, having graduated from which I will bring great benefit both to my family and my country as an expert in the field of Psychology.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nDestiny Boarding School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

Jumaboy was born and raised in the village and since his youth has bred livestock. His father taught him how to properly care for cattle when he was a child, and this knowledge and experience has proved useful to Jumaboy over the years. When he grew up Jumaboy was able to buy a few head of cattle and start his own business. Slowly he began to grow his herd and now he has six adult cattle. Every week Jumaboy visits cattle markets and purchases a calf, fattens it up for a few months, and resells it at a higher price. His wife helps him with everything on the farm. She looks after the cattle and when her husband is away she takes them to the fields to graze. Jumaboy also farms clover and corn on a small plot of land. Now, because the price of cattle has fallen, Jumaboy cannot realize a profit on his fattened cattle. From his savings he has managed to purchase feed for the cattle, but he doesn't have enough money to purchase any calves. To solve this problem he decided to turn to MDO Arvand for support. With the loan Jumaboy wants to purchase a few calves.

They already have families of their own. \n\nShe has been running her store for five years already, and its earnings greatly helped cover their daily sustenance. She sells dry and packaged commodities directly to consumers. All products are essential food and household items. She earns by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece.  \n\nTo compete well with other stores nearby, she is humbly asking for a PHP 25,000 loan to fill her store with canned goods, instant noodles, biscuits, soda, toiletries, etc. Although there are times when her sales are low, she is confident that her sales will pick up once customers see that she offers more grocery items.\n\nAs any small general store owner does, she dreams of having a big grocery store someday. She prays for God's abundance in their senior years. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\n\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":206.28,"image":{"id":1972995,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for groceries, beverages and toiletries to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-09-11T17:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-11T17:10:03Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Linda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":206.28,"local_amount":9375.03,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":9652.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045453}],"funded_date":"2015-10-10T22:28:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":944208,"name":"Rollan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rollan is thankful that he received financial assistance thrice which really helped sustain his food business.

","en":"This 33 year old man is Giyosiddin. Giyosiddin is an honest and responsible man from the Shahrituz district. He has been practicing animal husbandry in the district for five years. He has a barn for the animals which he buys and feeds for 3-4 months before reselling. Most of his time is spent with the animals. This work is of primary importance to him because he uses it to support his family. Giyosiddin is married and has a child. His wife stays at home and takes care of household duties.
