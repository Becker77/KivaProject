She is married to Marcelo, a mason, with whom she has three children, two who are in high school and the youngest is still in the elementary level in school. About half of the Philippine\u2019s population lives in rural areas and Ofelia's family is one of them. <br \/><br \/>Ofelia took advantage of the cool climate in the upland area and thought of going into the ornamental business. Ofelia has been growing ornamental plants for five years already. She grows garden plants like golden shower, ylang ylang, and bromeliads, and a variety of hanging plants. Her regular customers are local tourists, neighbors and the nearby community. To help her expand her farm, she is requesting a loan in the amount of PHP 11,000 to buy fertilizer, pots, nets, and various seedlings to grow a variety of ornamentals. Ofelia puts her best efforts to protect her farm from various insects that could damage her plants. Her earnings helped cover their daily sustenance and sending her children to school. <br \/><br \/>She is thanking you in advance for supporting her livelihood. Ofelia dreams for her ornamental business to flourish in the coming years. She aims to send her children to college to allow them better opportunities to improve their lives.

She is Colombian and she and her family are residents of the country as of 3 years ago as refugees. Now she lives with her father and sister. Claudia recently received her college degree in English, and she is getting ready to start Nursing at the University of Costa Rica. It is a school that gives her a socioeconomic study as well as the benefit of a student scholarship. On the other hand, it would be very difficult for her Dad to pay for her studies since he also bears the costs of her sister's high school expenses. <br \/><br \/>She inherited her father's entrepreneurial spirit and together they work in a small family business where she makes, sells and distributes sweets. Productos Barrera, within 3 years of starting up, has managed to make itself known and gain the acceptance of the customers. They offer 2 different types of sweets. The flagship products are the dulce de leche, or \"arequipe,\" as it is called in Colombia, and a strawberry dessert that Claudia took over production of more than a year ago. This strawberry dessert is a combination of gelatin and marmalade, and has a lot of acceptance in the market. <br \/><br \/>The small factory is located in the patio of the family's house. It should be mentioned that this property is rented. It has handcrafted machinery suitable for the type of production and product packaging. Currently, the two types of sweets are available to the customers, in 10 different presentations. <br \/><br \/>Claudia's goal is to work with her father, strengthening the product line and increasing production. With this, she can continue with her studies and get more income for the family. Because of her young age and little time in the country, she does not have any credit history. She expresses that this is the first loan she has asked for, which will be used to reinforce the work earnings, to increase manufacturing volume. <br \/><br \/>Claudia and her father, as owners of the business, are looking to recover as much of the six pack packaging for reuse, as well as the carton labeling strips in 6 of the desserts. In addition, the machines used in the manufacturing process do not produce any pollution, all with the idea of preserving the

He inherited it from his father, and it is very crowded with neighbors from the area, who besides playing this table sport, spend time with friends and acquaintances while they consume drinks that he sells in his establishment, among them beer, sodas, and juice. \r\nAt the start of the Christmas festivities, the people from Barranquilla typically celebrate with a vigil that starts the night of December 7th with multicolor lanterns illuminated with lights from inside, and which are placed in front of houses and sidewalks to celebrate the Immaculate Conception. Jose makes these artisanal lanterns, with wooden ribbons in the form of a truncated pyramid, whose faces are covered in cellophane paper, in green, yellow, red, or blue colors. \r\nAt 26, Jose is a young man ready to grow commercially because of his hard work and dedication. Currently he is applying for his first credikiva through the Mario Santo Domingo foundation, to invest in a stock of sodas, juice, and beer.

She noticed there wasn't anyone selling tortillas in her community, that's why she decided to start this business. At the beginning, she bought gas, paper, firewood, corn, etc. with her own savings.<br \/>\"When I started, I had many clients and my revenue was very good, since mine was the only tortilla shop in the area and i had no competition\", Vero happily tells us. \"Unfortunately, as time goes by, my revenue has dwindled a little\". However throughout those 10 years, she has gained a solid clientele which buys tortillas every day for their family meals.

Some of the products she makes are serviette holders, tortillas baskets, rugs, pot holders, etc. The idea to start this business came from her parents who taught her the techniques and instilled her with enthusiasm for handicrafts. Her business has improved considerably and she now has a much larger workshop where different members of the family help making the merchandise. \"I am very happy especially since we have been invited to expositions where we have been able to make our product known. For us the dissemination of crafts is the most important\" commented Abigail happily. <br \/><br \/> At the same time she is grateful to VF M\u00e9xico as thanks to the loans she could buy polishers and the tools that are necessary. Her current goal is to obtain greater income by increasing production. She also plans to sell in different parts of the Republic while continuing to attend expositions. With the opportunity of the new loan she plans to buy brass to continue her work. <br \/><br \/>The other members of the group are: Tiburcio who will invest in handicrafts; Antonio who is a veterinarian; Ang\u00e9lica has a stationary shop; Austroberto will invest in pigs; Magalli in materials for crafts; Ana Laura in sheep and Carmen has a carpenter shop.<br \/><br \/>The photograph shows some of Abigail's crafts.

Luis Arturo is interested in beginning a process of converting his coffee plantation to organic [production], which, added to the fair trade certification mark that he already possesses, will give him many more opportunities to market his coffee.\r\n\r\nLuis Arturo is now applying for a loan to purchase equipment necessary to give good treatment to the organic farm. This equipment will make the application of the supplies easier and thus make the farm easier to manage.\r\n\r\nThe loan will help Luis Arturo to acquire necessary equipment to make the management of his parcel of land, which is in the process of being converted to organic production, easier, and thus he will have the possibility of making his coffee farm more productive and profitable.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1971469,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Fair Trade"],"use":"to buy materials necessary to convert his coffee plantation to 100% organic production, such as coffee plants of organic origin and organic compost, among other items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Corqu\u00edn, Copan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":448,"posted_date":"2015-09-11T23:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-11T23:00:12Z","loan_amount":3650,"lender_count":117,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Arturo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":73,"loan_amount":3650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2018-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":15790},{"due_date":"2019-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":18316.4},{"due_date":"2020-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":21247.02},{"due_date":"2021-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":24646.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2018-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":720.42},{"due_date":"2019-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":835.69},{"due_date":"2020-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":969.39},{"due_date":"2021-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1124.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-09-18T17:44:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":935310,"name":"Zaldy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zaldy is a 50-year-old fisherman from the town of Carles in Iloilo.

They live in a small village Ramthenga in Falakata,West Bengal. Anita attended school until seventh grade.\n \nAnita is a homemaker who looks after her children, does all the household works and in her spare time helps her husband in his farm work. Her husband is engaged in farming, growing vegetables and crops. He has his own farmland which he inherited from his parents. He struggles hard to grow good quality crops and vegetables. But the income generated from the farming is insufficient to run the family of four members. So they decided to grow paddies in order to earn more profits. \n\nThus, Anita requests a loan from BJS (Kiva\u2019s partner) to buy good quality seeds, fertilizers, and manure for paddy cultivation. They believe that the loan will help her to provide all of their farming needs and in that way obtain higher revenues.  They will be able to improve the well-being of their family.\n\nIn the future Anita wants to construct a concrete house with the profit and she is thankful to her lenders.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1957354,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase agricultural inputs for growing paddies (rice).","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Falakata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2015-09-11T23:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-11T23:10:05Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-09-13T16:29:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":927752,"name":"Khorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khorn, 49, is a farmer living in Kampong Cham province and she has three children. \r\n\r\nKhorn has been growing cassava to support her living conditions for twenty-nine years.

home or in the immediate vicinity. Kamalagandhi's family of four are among millions affected by rural India's sanitation crisis. Without access to a toilet, her family has to walk long distances to relieve themselves in the false privacy of dense bushes or isolated fields. These unsanitary practices make them vulnerable to infections, and the lack of privacy exposes them to molestation or worse. <br \/><br \/>Joining hands with two others whose families face similar problems due to a lack of sanitation facilities, Kamalagandhi has formed a group and is hoping to address this issue.

located in the northern part of Tajikistan. The city is famous for its long-standing traditions and sophisticated culture. Tuhta is a resident carefully preserving one of her people's national symbols. She sews \"kurpa\" and \"kurpacha\". She is married and has children.

The population has been described as very active and hard-working. The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank, \u201cMujeres de Chinimajul\u201d, was formed by 10 women who have a strong work ethic. These ladies, who have a variety of small businesses, are requesting a loan from KIVA investors to purchase supplies, increase income and meet the daily needs of their families.<br \/><br \/>Elisa is a 37-year-old member of the group who was able to attend school until the 3rd grade. She is divorced and supports her four children, who are all enrolled in school. Some are in elementary school while others are in high school. It was 10 years ago that she became both mother and father to her children. They are her motivation for working hard, so that they can have a more prosperous future. <br \/><br \/>Elisa buys and sells beans, vegetables, chickens and pigs. She is requesting a loan to purchase 15 chickens, 2 pigs and a large quantities of beans. With the earnings from the sale of these items, she will re-invest the funds in additional inventory and will be able to cover the personal and educational needs of her four children.<br \/><br \/>Elisa and her friends in the Trust Bank look forward to their monthly meetings. After transacting business on their loans, the ladies participate in educational trainings conducted by a facilitator from Friendship Bridge.

In addition to this, the love to psychology I have inherited from my mother, I think. <br \/><br \/>I am the only child in my family and I live with my mother. My parents divorced when I was two years old, and my mother never married another man again. As everybody knows, the divorce process brings a lot of stress and depression, which my mother also faced. My mother had a great grief, but she promised to devote her life to me, so started to read psychological books as needed support from someone or something.<br \/><br \/>My mother is an economist by her profession. Currently, she is unemployed, which caused big problems in our expenses, and we have difficulties in paying my university tuition fee. Currently, she is attending job fairs and going to the interviews. <br \/><br \/>I believe in fate that if someone tries and does his\/her best, for sure God will bless him\/her later. I have always studied well and was an active student at school.

State of El Quiche.  It is almost 6,000 feet high surrounded by lush green forests and higher mountains.  Three Mayan languages, along with Spanish are spoken by the people.  \n\nUspant\u00e1n\u2019s beauty is reflected in the Friendship Bridge\u2019s Trust Bank \u201cVista Hermosa\u201d (Beautiful View).  Seven very dedicated and hardworking women make up the Trust Bank.  They only have had a formal education through the 2nd grade as was customary when they were young.  Young girls were expected to stay at home to help take care of household chores.  Their lack of a formal education  has not deterred them and they have become small business owners in ventures such as animal husbandry, selling medicines, and owning convenience stores.  \n\nMaria, who is 47 years old and married, has a business raising and then selling chickens and pigs at her local market, as well as in nearby markets in towns near her home.  Recently, she has had a large demand for her animals, so she is asking for a loan to buy more.   She is driven to increase her business, thus her income, because she has seven children who are in primary, as well as high school.  Maria wants her children to have a good education so that they can become professionals to break the current stereotypes of the Maya being uncultured and uneducated.  She also wants to have a higher quality of life for herself, her family and her community. \n\nThe women of \u201cVista Hermosa\u201d are very grateful to KIVA investors for providing the loans that help them grow their businesses which in turn helps them build their homes little by little.  In Guatemala it is impossible for women, like Maria who have little or no education, to get credit from banks.  Friendship Bridge with its \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d program of combining credit with education helps the women build their businesses, their self-esteem and create a better future for themselves, their families and their communities.  It is a win-win for all.

When he retired, he worked part-time as a security guard for other companies and made the decision to launch his own business last year. Due to his law enforcement background and passion for safety, it was natural for Jonathan to start his own security business. He now currently employs a staff of 40 people. <br \/><br \/>The greatest success he has had so far has been the ability to be contracted by many companies. However, he has faced several challenges because he is operating with very little capital. So far, he has been doing his best to make it work. <br \/> <br \/>Jonathan is currently seeking a loan to continue the growth of his company. He recently signed a contract that requires him to increase the size of his staff, buy new equipment such as radios, earpieces and uniforms for his employees. He is also in need of purchasing additional equipment for his office. He hopes to be able to continue to grow his business for his family.

Because of its fabulous textiles, tourists from all over the globe come to visit.\n\nThe members of \u201cLas Gemelas\u201d are finishing their second loan cycle with KIVA.  They are happy to report that they have seen their incomes increase which, in turn, has had a very positive impact on their families.  To continue to see changes in their lives, the women are asking for another loan to invest in their businesses.\n\nIsabela, who is 26 years old and a mother of a small child, has an unusual business for women.  She drives a \u201cTuk Tuk\u201d, a three-wheeled covered motorcycle taxi that can transport people around the town, as well as to the nearby town of San Pedro La Laguna.  The \u201cTuk Tuk\u201d requires a great deal of maintenance in order to keep it in excellent condition, as well as keep it safe for her passengers.  Thus, Isabela is asking for a loan to purchase a variety of necessary vehicle parts.\n\nThanks to the Friendship Bridge \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d program of non-formal education along with microcredit loans, the empowerment of the Maya women in Guatemala is becoming quite noticeable.  Through the program\u2019s non-formal education, the women learn important topics like better business practices, investing wisely and saving for the future.  They also learn the importance of good health through healthy eating habits and the use of medicinal plants.  As they grow healthier both mentally and physically, so do their families and their communities.  This is a winning combination in which KIVA investors play an important role.  Thank you for helping the Maya women to have a brighter and more prosperous future!!!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":337.5,"image":{"id":1974112,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy new parts for her motor taxi or tuk-tuk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Juan la Laguna, Solol\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2015-09-12T19:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-12T19:10:02Z","loan_amount":3375,"lender_count":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candida Dominga ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Veronica Rosalia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Juana Encarnacion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosario Elvira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Veronica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":26000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":3375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2600},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":337.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":2600,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2607.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752079893}],"funded_date":"2015-09-29T13:34:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":945845,"name":"Auxiliadora","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"AUXILIADORA DE 60 A\u00d1OS DE EDAD, ORIGINARIO DE MANAGUA MADRE SOLTERA CON TRES HIJOS MAYORES DE EDAD E INDEPENDIENTE, SE CARACTERIZA POR SER TRABAJADORA, RESPONSABLE, CON GANAS DE SUPERACION PERSONAL,LAMENTABLEMENTE NO PUDO ESTUDIAR POR FALTA DE RECURSOS ECONOMICOS, TUBO SUS HIJOS A TEMPRANA EDAD, LO CUAL LA OBLIGO A TRABAJAR PARA PODER BRINDARLES A SUS HIJOS LO NECESARIO.

In her home she runs a business, a sewing workshop that she was able to improve and furnish with the necessary machines thanks to her other income selling clothing as a street vendor.<br \/><br \/>Mar\u00eda says it has not been easy. She bought clothing little by little to sell door to door.  It was hard at first because it is not easy to start a business, but she gained experience, and it has gone very well for her so far.  Thanks to that income and the support of her husband, who is a construction worker, she bought sewing machines and they were able to set up a space in the house for her workshop. Now she has this additional income to be able to support her children.
