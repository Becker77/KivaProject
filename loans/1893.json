She is married, and her husband is an active soldier. They have two daughters. Thanks to the efforts of her parents, she was able to finish her university studies. The lack of economic resources brought her to work from the time she was very little in order to be able to support her needs and be able to help with the needs of her family. Wilma is a native of the city of Latacunga. They live in an urban neighborhood of the Saquisili canton in the house of her parents. Thus they don't pay rent or spend for food.\r\n\r\nThe major obstacle that they have had has been the lack of financing to be able to make her business grow. She now has a dream that consists of setting up her chicken business again. She now works marketing Ecuadorian flowers, but in previous years she was already raising chickens. She learned this work from her parents.\r\n\r\nShe needs the loan to begin raising chickens and to buy the food. This will also help Wilma to be able to improve her style of living and that of her family, and [give her] the opportunity to get ahead. In addition, in the future she would like her business to grow more every day, and at the same time she is grateful to Kiva for making possible the growth of her work life and her personal life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":239.57,"image":{"id":1975539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to undertake her business of raising chickens; thus she will diversify her business and will grow as a micro-entrepreneur.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Latacunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":190,"posted_date":"2015-09-13T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-13T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilma Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2472.84,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":121.8},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":117.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":115.4},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":125.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":123.51},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":124.85},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":132.31},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":131.54},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":133.31},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":138.96},{"due_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":140.88},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":142.3},{"due_date":"2016-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":146.66},{"due_date":"2016-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":149.65},{"due_date":"2016-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":152.28},{"due_date":"2016-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":155.81},{"due_date":"2017-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2017-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":162.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.91},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.66},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.31},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.62},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.96},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.43},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.65},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.43},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.08},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":141},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.42},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.79},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":149.78},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.41},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.95},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.48},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":239.57,"local_amount":239.36,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:19:33Z","rounded_local_amount":239.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752080714}],"funded_date":"2015-10-12T07:43:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":946083,"name":"Shabana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shabana is 54 years old and married.

She is really doing great with the loan and appreciates Kiva for the support.  She used the profit to pay school fees, repay the loan, buy a plot of land, build her house, buy a motorcycle and cover household expenses.  She will use this loan to buy up-to-date styles of clothes to meet her customers' requirements.  She dreams of buying a car.<br \/><br \/>Hawa will make sure she pays back her loan within the scheduled time."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":416.56,"image":{"id":1971217,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy up-to-date styles of clothes to meet her customers' requirements.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":87,"posted_date":"2015-09-13T06:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-13T06:40:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166769.75},{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":172217.56},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":178891.99},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":184722.06},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":190021.49},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":195928.76},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":202545.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":208902.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.37},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.48},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.68},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.43},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.52},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":158.2,"local_amount":338987.31,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":339661.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731185500},{"amount":258.36,"local_amount":553635.54,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:59:13Z","rounded_local_amount":554737.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752273820}],"funded_date":"2015-09-17T16:35:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":946165,"name":"Merlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlita is 42 years old and married with four children.<br \/><br \/>She works hard to provide for her family.

married, and has a high school education. She has been selling clothing as the main source of income for her family for 15 years, having started out with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Cholponai's hard work, she currently has inventory worth 120,000 som (KGS) and her monthly income is 27,000 som (KGS).

Their combined income sustains their daily needs and the education of their small children.<br \/><br \/>But the problem in Christopher\u2019s location is a shortage of water that affects the operation of his business. He plans to address this difficulty by putting up a deep well water pump in his backyard. He needs to buy a motor pump, pipes, hollow blocks, cement, and other materials necessary in this project. He is requesting a PHP 60,000 loan for this purpose. He will use part of the loan to buy feed and additional supplies for his variety store.

She is 38 years old and lives in a civil union with the father of her 2 children, the younger of whom is studying in primary school and the adolescent in secondary school. They live on land of approximately four hectares donated by INDER. She and her husband work the plot of land; she makes a living from farming. She has experience raising animals, as well as planting fruit and vegetables. These activities are the only source of income for her home for which they all work their land together.<br \/><br \/>On occasion, Ana works for periods of time on other plots or banana plantations that are in the community, owing to which she is the only source of work. She always works with the goal of excelling and improving her and her family\u2019s living conditions. <br \/><br \/>She is going to invest her loan in planting Datil banana trees, as well as purchasing supplies for their care. It is important to mention that she and her companion carry out the entire production cycle of their fruit, from when they plant it until they deliver it to the purchaser, sealed and packed in boxes. They sell it to an intermediary who is contracted by the Chiquita Company. At this moment, this productive banana tree activity is the primary income for her home. The previous loans have allowed her to capitalize and with it cover all of her home expenses as well as her children\u2019s studies. <br \/><br \/>One of her goals is to repair her home, since it is in a bad state, in addition to continuing to support her children in their educational costs, because for her it is very important that they finish their academic studies. She has always invested the different loans that she has obtained through the Fundaci\u00f3n in farming activities. Along with her, those that make up the group are three more members that are going to invest in activities such as yucca farming and raising chickens and laying hens. They are all searching for common assets, self-improvement, and the growth of themselves and their families."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1975789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase seed and agricultural supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Lim\u00f3n, Pococ\u00ed, Roxana, La Curia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2015-09-14T00:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-14T00:30:06Z","loan_amount":3750,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Yancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Xinia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":3750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":610109.51},{"due_date":"2016-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":665019.37},{"due_date":"2017-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":724871.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1143.96},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1246.91},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1359.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Tyler","image":null}},{"id":946709,"name":"Felly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Felly, 39, is married with six children.

They are women who are joining together to obtain benefits and thereby be able to fulfill their common objectives. \r\n\r\nThanks to their organization, they have the opportunity to access credit under the women's communal bank program, as for various reasons, the majority of the members do not have the ability to obtain financing from regular banks. They are looking to succeed and see their businesses grow. All the members work with their families on their parcels of land, which were given to them by state institution current called INDER. It is a group with a great deal of history, and an excellent payment record.\r\n\r\nIt is made up of five members who will invest in agricultural activities. They have obtained 7 loans. Gloribeth has been the chair of the group since it started, and has been re-elected over the years, as the other women see her as providing the required leadership for fulfilling the responsibilities of this important position. She is a very hardworking and independent woman. She is 54 years old, married, and has 3 children, all adults. They do not live with her as they already have families of their own. \r\n\r\nShe and her husband have always farmed, and this their household's sole source of income. Their children engage in farming also, as they are fully experienced in farming.  She is going to use this loan to purchase cattle for fattening, as well as the supplies needed to look after them. She also has dairy cattle, from whose milk she produces cheese that she sells in the community.

She did not allow her separation to cause her to settle where she is.  She moved ahead and started a business of her own to raise her three children.  One of her children is in High School and the other two are in Elementary School. \r\n\r\nShe started her hardware shop about eight months ago.  She sells various car oils, lubricants, and hose. She values and takes care of her business since this is her main source of livelihood. She earns money by buying and selling products that help clean and protect engines so they operate efficiently. Aside from her machinery products, she also sells ready to wear clothes. \r\n\r\nTo serve the needs of more vehicle owners in her community, she is seeking assistance in the amount of 40000 to pay for various engine oils like Delo and Helix. Part of the loan will also pay for ready to wear clothes from wholesalers to sell to her neighbors, friends and relatives. She trusts that you will consider her request as she needs the funds badly to sustain her business and provide for the needs of her children. She thanks KIVA for your noble cause.\r\n\r\nAgnes aims to maintain her hardware shop and build a ready to wear clothes store someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.

In one of the neighborhoods, a group called Las Pagadores [The Women Who Pay] got together. The name refers to the responsibility of its members. They are: Juana who sells cosmetics; Irene and Jose who sell groceries; Claudia who sells shoes and cosmetics; Mary who sells lingerie and shoes; Sarai who sells shoes; and Teodor who sells food.\r\n\r\nIrene is a woman who is proud of where she's from and shares the value of hard work with her peers. She is the mother of three daughters and a son who study and depend on her financially. For this reason she decided to open a grocery store in order to offer them greater opportunities. In the beginning she only sold fruits and vegetables, but with time she added basic food products, in addition to snacks and candy.\r\n\r\nIn order to have an appropriate venue, she accommodated a room in her house with a window overlooking the street. She bought iron shelves and set them up so that the merchandise is always in the customer's sight. Thanks to her good assortment of products, affordable prices, and good customer service, she has been able to overcome the challenges of competition and investing in restocking products. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, her backyard garden is an orchard for beans, chayote squash, prickly pear, cilantro, radishes and cucumbers to sell in her store. As with previous loans with VF Mexico, this loan will buy rice, beans, oil, soup, sugar, tuna, mayonnaise, canned peppers, bread, crackers, tomatoes, peppers, onions, and carrots in order to increase her sales. \r\n\r\nShe will use the profits to help her husband with household expenses and replenish her store.

On the way, one can enjoy looking at the woods, listen to the sound of the birds, and appreciate the height of the hills. There, the group Desarrollo was formed, a name they chose because they hope that their activities will prosper. The members are: Consuelo, who sells tacos; Maria, tamales and grinding services; Silvia, clothing; and Adela, Jose, Edi, and Marcos, who work in pig breeding. \r\nConsuelo is a very friendly woman, the mother of two young children who still live with her. She also has a granddaughter who she loves as her own daughter. She has 29 years of experience being in charge of a grocery store. At the start, she only sold sodas and a few products. However, she says her clients told her: you should sell more groceries, because other stores do not offer these products, come on!\u201d Today, she has a wide stock and provides special attention to her clients. \r\nThe benefits she has received have motivated her to start with the grinding service, animal breeding, taco sales, and farming and selling sugar cane. All the previous things are possible thanks to the help she receives from her family and opportunities given by VF Mexico.\r\nOn this occasion, she will invest the loan in the purchase of meat, tortillas, vegetables, chilies, and sodas. \u201cI am the happiest woman in the world, I hope God cares for each of the people who make these benefits possible,\u201d are the words expressed by Consuelo. \r\n*These are the members of the group. The photograph was taken at the \u201cbride of the sun.\u201d Consuelo wears a pink blouse. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1009.12,"image":{"id":1973387,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy meat, tortillas, vegetables, chilies, and sodas.

On the way, the Pico de Orizaba can be appreciated in its maximum splendor, as it is usually surrounded by clouds and the light of the sun creates a unique atmosphere. \r\nIn this community, the group named Alegria(Joy) was formed, as this trait characterizes all of its members. The group is made up by: Karina, who sells fruit cocktails; Rufina, traditional fabrics; Andrea, groceries, novelty products, and sodas; Reyna, traditional food; Marcela, fish; Teresa, groceries; and Rosa, sodas and vegetables. \r\nTere, who is better known as Teresa, has been both a father and mother, as she raised her four children by herself. Her entrepreneurial spirit has taken her to sell bread and fish, to fresh chicken inside her community. Four years ago, she found the most effective way of obtaining an income through a grocery store. At the beginning, her business only consisted of a small table where she places rice, sugar, soup, oil, and eggs, that is, the most basic products. \r\nHowever, currently her store is located inside of a wooden shop in which she has collected two refrigerators and two spacious shelves where she exhibits her merchandise: \u201cI sell a bit of everything, little by little,\u201d she says in a great mood.

The residents there have preserved traditions and customs based on respect and kindness. One of the popular tourist attractions in the region is the Lake of Mil Islas [Thousand Islands.]  \r\n\r\nThe Los Soles group [The Suns] comes from one of the said regions, and the name was chosen by the members because they love sunsets. The members are: Dari\u00e9n who sells food; Isabel, food and containers; Elvia, drinks; Teresa, cosmetics and raising animals; Araceli, pastries; Alma, shoes; and Jos\u00e9, drinks and fishing.  \r\n\r\nMario is another one of the group members and has been in charge of a carpentry business for 10 years. He explained, \u201cAll of my life I have been a carpenter. Since I was a young boy, I was helping my father sand and refinish furniture. Later, I decided to be my own boss.\u201d\r\n\r\nDon Mayo, as he is known among friends, built a workshop in the courtyard of his home where he offers services Monday through Sunday from 8:00 AM in the morning until 8:00 PM at night. Note that he employs two people when his workload is high, and it is no wonder as his quality of work and customer service speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nWhat he likes most about his work is designing the furniture that will later be made in detail to materialize his ideas. For Mario, the satisfaction of meeting the household expenses through an income earned from his passion is the best motivation. \u201cMy family and wood are the driving force in my life,\u201d he added with a smile on his face.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is asking for this round will help him purchase wood, nails and glue \u2014 as he has future orders. The Suns group is also grateful to VF M\u00e9xico and Kiva for the new loan they have been offered because they have enriched their businesses.\r\n\r\n*The photo was taken at the home of Mario who is
