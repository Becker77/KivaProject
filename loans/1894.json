positive and hardworking woman. She is married and has four children. She lives in a small village. Since her childhood, Madina dreamed of becoming a teacher, but circumstances happened such that she could not obtain a college education due to financial hardships in her family. Right after finishing secondary school, Madina was married off, and she became a homemaker, but even always being at home, Madina keeps herself occupied. She and her husband try to do everything possible to provide their children with all of the necessities.\r\n\r\nTo ensure that they have a consistent income for food, Madina and her husband started their own business. They are involved in animal husbandry. Madina fattens up livestock and then sells meat and milk obtained from the livestock. Madina earns a good income from this business. Madina's husband also works at a local shop, and his work brings in additional income for the family. Their combined income is enough to live at middle class level, and they still do not have enough money to cover all of their needs. At the present time, Madina and her husband want to buy several heads of livestock for fattening up. This is why she comes to Arvand and wants to obtain a loan to buy livestock. Madina thanks Arvand for the support in advance - support that will allow her to improve her family's quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1958260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy livestock for fattening up","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-09-14T06:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-14T06:20:05Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Madina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":465.82},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":492.28},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":509.84},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":532.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.7},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.85},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-09-20T10:47:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":945280,"name":"Salimatou's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce groupement vient d\u2019entamer son onzi\u00e8me cycle de 6 mois.

living in the capital city for two years. Previously she lived with her parents, who work in farming, and her two siblings, who currently both support their parents at home and study. Gisela says that it has been difficult not having her family with her; she has had to sacrifice a lot. Gisela works as a teacher in a secondary school and at night is studying for a Master's in demographics and development.<br \/><br \/>Gisela has an undergraduate degree in social sciences. She wants to enhance her knowledge and apply it in this field.<br \/><br \/>Honesty, sincerity and an openness to cooperation with others are Gisela's main qualities. From a young age she was taught values and morals that are good for her and for others.<br \/><br \/>Gisela wants to help her country through development work that can help many people who want to do better in life. Today the labour market is become more and more demanding, and being aware of changes can be advantageous for professionals.<br \/><br \/>Gisela's motivation to continue studying and achieve her goals is her family. Since she was a girl, Gisela's parents have provided what she needs, and given what they had to her and her siblings.<br \/><br \/>Gisela says that often setbacks are opportunities. For example, last year Gisela could not begin a placement on time but several months later. However, had she done her placement when she had originally planned, she would not have received a new job opportunity.<br \/><br \/>Gisela wants to finish her Master's and then find a better job. In the future she would like to study for a PhD abroad."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1974824,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Unfortunately, at the present time her husband is far away from the family: he is away working in the Russian Federation, and sends them money each month.\r\n\r\nWhat Muhayo likes about the sewing business is the daily income and communicating with new people. She is taking a loan to buy a new sewing machine in order to improve the process of her work and acquire lots of clients.

His wife Malika is a sweet woman. She is very kind and hard-working. She sews dresses. Besides this she looks after the livestock, fattening them with the aim of selling them in the future for a good sum. And this brings them additional income. Gulom and Malika have a very close family. They do everything for the members of their family to have enough to live on. Gulom himself was unable to go to university, but he wants his wife to study and his children too. With this goal he would like to buy his wife a notebook computer. But since he recently completed a renovation of his house he does not have enough funds to buy the notebook, and so he has applied to MDO Arvand for a loan. He will buy his wife a notebook with the loan he receives and he plans to give it to her for her birthday."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":57.58,"image":{"id":1968362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Consumer Goods","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to buy a laptop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-09-14T18:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-14T18:30:07Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gulom","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":359.85},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":365.31},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":379.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":378.88},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":402.47},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":412.83},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":413.86},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":434.11},{"due_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":443.64},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":452.95},{"due_date":"2016-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":468.37},{"due_date":"2016-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":488.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.62},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.39},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.05},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.22},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.46},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.98},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.47},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.94},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":57.58,"local_amount":359.85,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":365.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755520211}],"funded_date":"2015-10-14T18:09:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":946910,"name":"Kenanga Indah Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The results from the pig business give a feeling of pleasure for all the members of Kenanga Indah group, and they can make their payments on time.

It is quite similar to a convenience store; however, it is a smaller version. You will see this in every barrios, barangays, or even in cities. You can find a variety (or \"sari-sari\" in Filipino) of items that can be bought at a cheap price since they sell the products by volume, kilos, or by piece. <br \/><br \/>One entrepreneur who is engaged in this type of business is Virginia. She is a 47-year-old CCT member who has been managing her own sari-sari store business for 5 years and she enjoys doing it. Virginia believes that CCT helps aspiring entrepreneurs in their business by granting loan requests and conducting business mentoring. Since Virginia wants to have additional capital for her business to grow and save money for their future, she decided to apply for a  30,000 PHP loan to add items for the business such as bottled drinks, sacks of rice, school supplies, and grocery items. <br \/><br \/>Despite being busy managing the business, Virginia spares time to attend a CCT group fellowship that consists of 10-15 individuals. There she can gain strength spiritually and hear testimonies from other CCT partners and is able to hear God\u2019s word, study the Word of God, build social relationships with other partners, and pay micro-finance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":216.72,"image":{"id":1977246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to add items for her business such as bottled drinks, sacks of rice, school supplies, and grocery items.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Muntinlupa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-09-14T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-14T19:30:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virgina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":108.36,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:37:03Z","rounded_local_amount":5061.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955646},{"amount":108.36,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5061.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045519}],"funded_date":"2015-09-21T00:24:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Julie Dietz","image":1476253}},{"id":946968,"name":"Elsie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elsie is a hardworking woman entrepreneur with two children.

Customers do not have to go far to buy small items. \r\n\r\nLydia started her business to provide another way for her family to earn income aside from the salary of her husband, Epifanio. Like other entrepreneurs, her goal is to succeed with her business to earn more profit and save money someday for the future. Lydia is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan to buy grocery items for her sari-sari store. She hopes that CCT will consider her application.

The amount will also be used to buy grocery items for her business.<br \/><br \/>On a weekly basis, Catherine regularly meets with her co-fellowship members to share her life\u2019s testimony and experience with business, to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship, and to listen to the Word of God. <br \/><br \/>A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 members. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social relationships with other partners, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":358.35,"image":{"id":1977248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy grocery items for her variety store business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Muntinlupa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-09-14T19:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-14T19:50:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catherine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.8},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":358.35,"local_amount":16666.64,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":16741.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045521}],"funded_date":"2015-10-14T18:31:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":946986,"name":"Rebecca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rebecca works hard to support her family.

This benefitted members of her community who previously had no establishment near their homes that allowed them to enjoy such services.  She also received a low interest rate and once she received the loan, her income increased.  However, when one of the computers was damaged, her service capability decreased.  <br \/><br \/>Lilibeth sends this message to the Kiva lenders: \"I am very thankful because with the loan I can work from home and continue caring for my children.\"  She now seeks a second loan from Kiva to buy a desktop computer and obtain faster internet service.  Her loan will be a big success again, and she will be able to respond opportunely to the needs of her customers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3.53,"image":{"id":1974818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"comprar\u00e1 un equipo de c\u00f3mputo de escritorio y acceder\u00e1 a un servicio de internet m\u00e1s veloz","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"San Juan Nepomuceno-Bolivar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-09-15T01:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-15T01:10:05Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilibeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":10600},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":61318},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":63158},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":65052},{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":67004},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":69014},{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":71084},{"due_date":"2016-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":73217},{"due_date":"2016-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":75413},{"due_date":"2016-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":77676},{"due_date":"2016-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":80006},{"due_date":"2016-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":82406},{"due_date":"2016-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":84878},{"due_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":87425},{"due_date":"2016-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":90048},{"due_date":"2017-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":92749},{"due_date":"2017-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":95531},{"due_date":"2017-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":98397},{"due_date":"2017-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":101349},{"due_date":"2017-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":104390},{"due_date":"2017-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":107521},{"due_date":"2017-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":110747},{"due_date":"2017-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":114069},{"due_date":"2017-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":216948}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3.53},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.44},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.05},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.68},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.34},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.69},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.41},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.14},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.89},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.67},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.47},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.29},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.14},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.02},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.92},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.84},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.8},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.78},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.8},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.84},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.92},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.02},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":3.53,"local_amount":10600,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:24:21Z","rounded_local_amount":10730.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752082779}],"funded_date":"2015-10-09T16:43:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Hiller","image":null}},{"id":947043,"name":"Laurence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Laurence is married and has four children, two of them still attending school in Kamwenge, Uganda.

It is also the name of a town southeast of Huehuetenango in the northeastern part of Guatemala. The area is quite mountainous and lush and one can find many natural springs that are the headwaters to rivers in the area.. Poor economic conditions have prompted some of the people who live here to travel elsewhere in Guatemala to work while many have gone to Mexico and the United States.\n\nSeven women who strive to conserve their beautiful traditional clothing have decided to fortify themselves and formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cMujeres de Chichuj\u201d. The ladies are hardworking and driven to achieve success. They have various businesses such as farming (growing and selling onions and tomatoes), selling tortillas and tamales, and animal husbandry and in their \u201cfree time\u201d, the women embroider beautiful and colorful typical blouses\u2026.all to increase income.\n\nCeleste is a member of the Trust Bank. She is 33 years old with one child. She was able to attend school until the fifth grade. Celeste grows onions and tomatoes. With the earnings from her sales of produce, she buys baby chicks to raise and sell. In addition, she embroiders typical blouses! She is requesting a loan to buy a large quantity of onion seeds, 400 small tomato plants and fertilizer so that all will flourish in the ground and produce high quality tomatoes and onions.\n\nThe ladies in the \u201cAguacatan\u201d Trust Bank look forward to their monthly meetings when they make payments on their loans and participate in educational trainings. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of microcredit and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d and it is very effective. A facilitator from the organization shares relevant information with the women on a variety of topics including health, hygiene and nutrition, setting goals and realizing dreams as well as how to get their children ready for school. Also discussed are effective business tools including planning, budgeting, pricing, marketing and customer service.\n\nEach Kiva lender who decides to fund loans for Celeste and her friends is truly appreciated.
