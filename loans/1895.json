As time goes by, the demand of the business continues to increase.  Heidi needs to buy boxes of hair treatments and other supplies to cater to more customers. This is why she is applying again for a loan, this time amounting to PHP 45,000. Once again, she is hoping that you will consider her story. <br \/><br \/>Heidi wants to have a bigger parlor someday that offers a variety of hair treatments and various beauty and wellness services. She believes that your help will make her business move forward. If ever granted, she will put some of the money to her savings account so she will have available emergency funds as well.<br \/><br \/>On a weekly basis, Heidi regularly meets with her co-fellowship members to share her life\u2019s testimony and experience on the business, as well as to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and listen to the Word of God.

She has completed high school. Her parents didn't have the money to pay university tuition fees. Her husband's earnings are not enough to sustain their family. Ravshanoy tries to help her husband selling clothes at the local market. She and her husband want their son to get higher education to spare him such difficulties as they experienced. \r\n\r\nRavshanoy requested a loan to install new windows. Last winter was so cold that all the family got ill very often and couldn't work. It affected their financial state. That's why Ravshanoy turned to MDO Avand for financial support.

He is married and works in the agricultural field, growing currants. At the present time Eduard is growing currants on 10 ares [0.1 hectares], but this autumn he will plant another 50 ares [0.5 hectares] of currants. He carries out all of his work on the land with the help of a rototiller. Eduard wants to expand his business, and for the development of the business he wants to buy a refrigerator (6 tonnes, 17 cubic meters). He will store his own produce in the refrigerator and gather from other small producers in his village: currants, raspberries, blackberries and gooseberries. At the present time Eduard sells his produce to companies specializing in export to CIS countries. After buying the refrigerator his produce will last longer and will preserve its quality, which will allow exporting berries to Europe."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1975329,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to

The large organizations where they extract the sugar are called sugar factories, and the season in which sugarcane is harvested is known as \"zafra\".<br \/><br \/>In the aforementioned community, a group was formed called Alfa y Omega [Alfa and Omega], whose name implies the beginning and end of anything, that is, the totality.  The members of the group are:  Julia and Ver\u00f3nica, who sell costume jewelry; Irma, who sells vol-au-vents [baked pastry shells filled with meat and sauce]; Rosalba, who sells clothes; Minerva, who sells tamale; Guadalupe, who sells footwear; Blanca, who sells traditional food; Lorena, who sells motorcycle parts; Juana, who sells groceries; and Virginia, who works in a butcher's shop.<br \/><br \/>The unity and strength shown by Irma and her husband Miguel is admirable, as they did everything possible so that their son could have the treatment he needed for his health.  After learning the recipe to make vol-au-vents, they began selling them door-to-door.  They had so much success, that they were able to open a food stall.  The vol-au-vents are made on a big table where Miguel makes dough out of the flour, and then shapes it to give it its traditional circular shape.  Now, they have several customers who come all the way to their house to taste this delicious dish, fresh out of the oven.  Others wait at home for the loaded truck to come by.<br \/><br \/>Irma and Miguel are especially grateful to VF M\u00e9xico for the loans, as they have enriched their business.  This time the loan will be useful because they will invest it in purchasing flour, cheese, ham, butter, chilies, bags, soft drinks, juices, meat, and gas.<br \/><br \/>The money they have earned has been invested in their son's treatment, and in buying an oven, a crate for tacos, tables, chairs, and, 4 months ago, they opened a repair shop.  Their dream is to remodel their house, to buy a blender, and to build two shops for their businesses, thus creating a legacy for their grandchildren.<br \/><br \/>* The photograph was taken at Irma's house.

Cabe mencionar que una vez cocinadas las tortillas, son envueltas en servilletas bordadas artesanalmente por Marta misma. Algunos de los objetivos alcanzados has sido adquirir un local fijo, solventar la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos, comprar un refrigerador y un molino nuevos adem\u00e1s de invertir en costuras para sus bordados que tambi\u00e9n pone a la venta.\n   En esta ocasi\u00f3n comprara ma\u00edz y un par de piedras para el molino continuando, ya que su producci\u00f3n es de 30 a 40 kilos de masa utilizada al d\u00eda. Los clientes sienten mucha confianza en acudir a su negocio pues, adem\u00e1s de la calidad, la atenci\u00f3n de Marta es excepcional. \n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en el local de Do\u00f1a Marta quien sostiene una tortilla en la mano.\n","en":"REVISED\r\n\r\nIn Veracruz, there is a small community whose main economic activity is cattle raising. Top-quality beef as well as milk and dairy products are produced in this area. Such economic activity is so important to the inhabitants that every year they celebrate the \"Feria Ganadera\" (Livestock Fair), where locals and foreigners get together to enjoy the events and take part in the competitions. \r\n\r\nThe Perseverancia Group is from the above mentioned region. Its members chose that name because it reflects their desire to get ahead in spite of the obstacles. The group's members and their occupations are the following: Ma. De Lourdes sells desserts; Gregoria and Rosa, groceries; Nayeli and Ricarda, food; Marta, tortillas; Lucia, costume jewellery; Alejandro, shoes; Melvi and Jessica, clothing; Sara, building materials; and Margarita runs an auto parts store.\r\n\r\nMarta has been running her business for 22 years now. She sells handmade tortillas. This means that she makes her tortillas entirely by hand and cooks them on top of a \"comal\" (a metal hotplate for cooking tortillas).   \r\n\r\nHer business has been successful because few people make and sell tortillas in her neighbourhood. In addition to this, Marta's tortillas have a unique flavour that no tortilla machine can match. She learned the trade when she was eight years old, as it is customary in the community, but she never imagined that this skill would bring her so many rewards today. \r\n\r\nShe starts working very early in the morning to have her product ready for when the workers stop by her business to buy the tortillas that they will eat during their lunch break. \r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that once the tortillas are cooked, they are wrapped in napkins that Marta has embroidered herself. \r\n\r\nSome of the goals that she has already achieved include acquiring a permanent stand, paying for her children's education, buying a new refrigerator and a new mill, and investing in sewing supplies for her embroideries, which she also sells.\r\n\r\nThis time she will buy corn and a couple of millstones to keep her mill going because she produces between 30 and 40 kilos of tortilla dough every day.  \r\n\r\nMarta has earned her customers' trust because, in addition to the quality of her product, she provides them with an excellent customer service.\r\n\r\n*The photograph was taken at Marta's tortilla stand. She is the one holding a tortilla in her hand. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":6225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3501.56,"image":{"id":1973353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase corn and millstones.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tierra Blanca, Ver","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-09-16T00:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-16T00:10:02Z","loan_amount":6225,"lender_count":156,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gregoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Ma De Lourdes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nayeli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessica Karina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia Jazmin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ricarda Hernandez Martinez","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandro Hernandez Esteban","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melvi Guzman Perez ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara Gonzalez Vega","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":104000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":6225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6500},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":6500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":389.07},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":389.07},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":389.07},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":389.07},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":389.06},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":389.06},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":389.06},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":389.06},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":389.06},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":389.06},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":389.06},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":389.06},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":389.06},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":389.06},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":389.06},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":389.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1945.31,"local_amount":32500,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:59:04Z","rounded_local_amount":32574.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204566},{"amount":1556.25,"local_amount":26000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:29:27Z","rounded_local_amount":26059.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752291990}],"funded_date":"2015-09-18T09:42:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Beatriz Flores","image":null}},{"id":947351,"name":"Esther","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esther is a Kiva borrower, and she has 4 children.

As she continued to get several certifications in Active Isolated Stretch, she became more involved in the process of stretching her clients.Many of her clients shared with her that  stretching was making a noticeable difference in their body and health. Such improvements motivated Wallis to develop Body Stretch Therapy in 2013. <br \/><br \/>Wallis' greatest success thus far has been the amazing testimonials she continues to receive from her clients.

The members of the group are enterprising women who have started their own businesses: Guadalupe and Matilde, chicken; Karina, fruits and vegetables; Deysi, chicken, tamales, and gelatin; Fabiana, groceries; and Jamileth, shoes.<br \/><br \/>Fabiana is a member of the group.  She's married to Mart\u00edn.  Fabi, as she's known, is the mother of two young men; the older one is 20 years old and the youngest is 17.  She went to school up to the second year of elementary school, so she learns every day with her children as they do their homework. <br \/><br \/>Four years ago she started selling candy, for which she set up a table outside her house to display the sweets, Totis-brand snacks, chicharrones, and salsa.  With her earnings she started to save so she could carry out her plans.  When she got her first loan from VisionFund Mexico, she managed to make her plans a reality.  She started with her grocery store, investing in shelves, a scale, rice, sugar, beans, soup, coffee, and milk.  Little by little, supported by her earnings and the loans she has received, she has managed to increase her stock.  She sells eggs, beans, sugar, rice, tuna, sardines, mayonnaise, light cream, milk, cheese, ham, and sausage.<br \/><br \/>The loans have changed Fabi's life because they have allowed her to earn more income.  She hopes that soon she can build a store, because her merchandise is set up in her house in what used to be the living room.  This time she'll invest the loan in buying rice, oil, beans, sugar, toilet paper, and detergent--the products in greatest demand among her customers.<br \/><br \/>\"I'm happy about the success of my little store, about my family's unconditional support, and about the blessing God has given me.  I thank those who make it possible for us to be granted loans.\"  The group is grateful to VF Mexico and Kiva for every opportunity offered by additional loans.<br \/><br \/>They are the group members.

married, and she has three daughters and one son.  She has a specialized secondary education.  She tries to live in harmony and friendship with everyone around her.  She has been involved in animal husbandry and agriculture for 23 years already.

One of the founding members is 31-year-old Evelyn who had the opportunity to graduate from high school and then go on to receive a diploma as a teacher, but because she was recently laid off and has not been able to obtain another teaching position, she has created a small business sewing and embroidering clothes.

Evelyn is asking for a loan to buy a variety of fabrics and threads to use for sewing and embroidering her various textile projects.  She has an increasing number of requests each month so she wants to enlarge her inventory to meet her customers\u2019 demands.  <br \/><br \/>On average, a Friendship Bridge client has had approximately 3 years of formal education. The ladies look forward to their monthly meetings when, after transacting business on their loans, they participate in educational training on practical subjects such as effective business management practices, empowerment and self-esteem as well as hygiene, health and nutrition.
