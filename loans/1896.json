regularly suffers from power outages 12-16 hours a day. He lives with his family in a small house. As an employee in the public sector, he earns a low income. This income barely covers all the family's needs. Because he is not able to save enough money, Imad took a USD loan from FATEN. With this loan, he will buy a solar system for heating water for the family house. Palestinians use water boilers that use either gas or gasoline to heat the water before a shower, which can be dangerous, expensive and inefficient.

But Merlyn remains strong, because it\u2019s her way of assisting her husband, Roberto, in providing for their children\u2019s needs and education.<br \/><br \/>To augment her income, she ventured into mineral water distribution and raising of hogs. This time, she needs additional capital worth PHP 20,000 to sustain the feeds for her hogs, and obtain more supplies for her store. She\u2019s hoping that you can lend her this amount, and praying that God will return more blessings to you.<br \/><br \/>She dreams for a better, healthy and long life for her whole family.

But Evangeline did not lose heart and hope because she knows that God will always be willing to provide and meet the needs of her family; instead, she saw herself wanting to improve her business yet the problem is how. <br \/><br \/>Then, this question led her eventually to CCT group ministries where she drew strength and motivation to indeed make her life better by developing strategic ways and discipline for her business. And just recently, she was introduced here to Kiva and eventually had the chance to request loans that further helped her in flourishing her businesses.<br \/><br \/>Inspired by \u201cloan that change lives,\u201d she is motivated again to borrow now a loan worth PHP 10,000 in order to continue improving her variety store. With this she can already increase her merchandise products and for sure, people nearby their place would be glad to be her customers because of the many options among her products. <br \/><br \/>By now, she\u2019s glad that her children are willing to help her to handle the business even early in the morning or late at night. She\u2019s dedicated to do this because she really wants to help her husband in satisfying the family needs. <br \/><br \/>She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

Such is the case of a lake in the state of Oaxaca, where the fishermen make a small pilgrimage in its waters while traveling to the Virgin of Guadalupe who, according to tradition, is the one who provides the fish throughout the year.  <br \/><br \/>In this community, there formed a group called \"Las Gaviotas\" [Seagulls] whose name is a reference to the flight that these birds make over the lake.  The members are: Guadalupe and Clara who sell fish; Blandina and \u00c1ngela, groceries; Mauricia, chicken; and Lidia, cosmetics.<br \/><br \/>Do\u00f1a Guadalupe and her husband Jos\u00e9 feel a special affection for the water because thanks to it they have been able to carry out their job: fishing.  Since they were little, their children were enthusiastic when they left with their father on board the raft for the center of the water and afterwards they were filled with joy when they saw the fish move inside the nets.<br \/><br \/>In order to sell the product it needs to be clean, which Do\u00f1a Lupe is in charge of as she is better known. Afterwards she makes packages for easy handling.  \"For a long time my family has made a living by fishing and selling \"mojarra\" [a type of fish, often the same as tilapia] since I already know what they weigh,\" she says with a smile.<br \/><br \/>The type of fish that lives in the region is called mojarra, \"I like selling mojarra because I have to deal with many people, I am known in many places, and I am glad that my children are involved in our work,\" says Lupe. For her, VF Mexico has been a great motivation, not only because of the loans but also the rewards that she receives; for example, her appearance in the institution's calendar and being visited by foreign staff to whom she shows the richness of the community.  The loan will be used by Do\u00f1a Lupe to buy awnings, more fish, and a refrigerator. <br \/><br \/>The profits have given her the opportunity to educate her children, remodel her house, and build two places where she plans to open a stationery shop and a food business.<br \/><br \/>*These are the members of the Las Gaviotas group.
