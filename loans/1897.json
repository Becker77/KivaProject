Margaret is happily married and is blessed with a lovely family. <br \/><br \/>For the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming. She grows maize and vegetables, and she also keeps sheep.

This challenge has not made her give up and she states: \"I have to do something for my family.\" <br \/><br \/>Margaret joined Juhudi Kilimo which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She requests a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Margaret is from a remote village that has poor roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables, and tomatoes) which require timely delivery to the market.

The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Margaret will never suffer losses due to delay in delivering produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. As a result, her income will increase. <br \/><br \/>Margaret is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community, because she intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike and help with farm work.

She is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase additional poultry. She believes the excess maize she has will be used in feeding the poultry. Sorghum will be used to give the poultry energy and green grams for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will lay more eggs of good quality, which will translate to more income. Apart from an increase in egg output, she will also get an increased output of poultry meat and this will increase her income and profit margins. Other than profits, she is going to benefit from chicken manure, which contains the highest amount of nitrogen of any livestock manure and is very valuable as fertilizer. She will save more money that would have been spent in buying fertilizer.<br \/><br \/>Through increased profits, she is going to turn around her living conditions and live a better life.

He never got the opportunity to advance his education and get a white-collar job, but these realities did not kill his dream of wanting to succeed in life. Sebastian has been farming for the past twenty years. Through these years, he has gathered so much experience, and all the farming techniques are at his fingertips. <br \/><br \/>Sebastian practices mixed farming (crop and goat farming). With his profits, he has managed to take care of his family's needs. He is very enterprising, and he is seeking a loan of 20,000 Kenyan shillings to buy seeds and start horticulture farming on his farm. Sebastian wants to take advantage of various conditions -- favorable weather patterns, a good road network in his village, good soil, and a ready market for horticulture products -- and reap more profits. <br \/><br \/>Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring men like Sebastian turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Sebastian hopes that he will improve his living conditions through this loan. By the end of the first year, his dreams and projections are that he will not only be selling in the local market, but also in international markets through the export of fruits and vegetables. Through these endeavours, he will be able to assure his family a secure future. <br \/><br \/>Sebastian is not a selfish man, and he wants to help society, which is why he will employ people on his horticulture farm; hence, have an impact on society."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":28.89,"image":{"id":1963456,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy seeds and start horticulture farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-09-17T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-17T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sebastian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2015-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2016-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.16},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.57},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.43},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.88},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.35},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.83},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.82},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.88},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":13.96,"local_amount":1396.02,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1443.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024294},{"amount":14.93,"local_amount":1492.54,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:29:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1542.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112327}],"funded_date":"2015-09-18T17:39:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":937519,"name":"Ruth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruth is an energetic smallholder farmer, a person who always has a smile drawn on her face.

She lives in a remote village in Siongiroi, in the South Rift region of Kenya. Nelly passionately loves dairy farming. She has been farming for the past five years and has always managed to provide for her family. Feeding the large family she has requires a lot of hard work and determination. Her other sources of income are crops, milk, and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her large family. <br \/><br \/>In farming, she enjoys the returns she gets, but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. She has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a high quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture, and the price of milk has been going up recently. Nelly, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she learned that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure, which will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling the milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market, and she will also sell to big dairy processing firms. <br \/><br \/>Nelly said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agriculture-based loans, and their interest rate is low and on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from the training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. Nelly hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. <br \/><br \/>This young woman does not want to stop. She hopes to progress every day, and in partnership with Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders, become a great dairy farmer.

Meet Elizabeth (pictured above), from the Kitale area of Kenya, an area that is very fertile. Elizabeth is 58 years old and a proud mother of angelic-looking children, whom she really adores and cherishes. In addition to doing some small business, Elizabeth is a very hardworking farmer. She has been farming for the past five years. She has gained so much experience through those years of farming. Elizabeth practices mixed farming. That is, she grows maize and keeps dairy cows. Through these activities she has been able to earn a decent and honest income. Because of the passion she has for farming, she has even nicknamed one of her cows. She really enjoys taking care of her cows. <br \/><br \/>Although Elizabeth has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious mum. Her farm has not been producing as much of a harvest lately, because of the lack of fertilizer and good seeds, and the presence of pests and diseases. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy farm implements and seeds, so as to expand her horticulture farm. Through the loan, Elizabeth will be assured of a bumper harvest, and this will translate into more profits and cash. Through the use of good seeds and fertilizer, she will increase her profit margins. Using this loan, Elizabeth will be able to expand her horticulture business. She sees a lot of room for improvement and growth. What is lacking is the capital to drive the positive change. With your loan, Elizabeth will make enough income to take care of her family and other farming expenses.<br \/><br \/>She wakes up early and goes to sleep very late every day, to give her family a decent living and afford her children proper education.

She is the mother of four lovely children. At a tender age, Florence's passion for farming and education drove her to start practicing mixed farming. She has been doing this for the past 10 years. When you ask, she\u2019ll tell you her most valuable asset is her two-acre farm. But it wasn't always this way. For a long time, Florence\u2019s farm couldn't even sustain her family. <br \/><br \/>In 2014, Florence heard about Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that serves smallholder farmers, and their partnership with Kiva. And from that day, life has never been the same. Like many farmers in the region, Florence keeps a dairy cow and poultry, and has a side hustle business (a motorbike business) and grows different varieties of crops. Kitale has a thriving market for dairy products. Florence has sustained herself through dairy farming. She enjoys the farming lifestyle. She has a connection with farm animals that goes deep, to the extent that she names each of them. <br \/><br \/>Florence dreams of expanding her dairy farm, but due to financial constraints, she has been unable to do so until now. From Kiva lenders, Florence is kindly requesting 52,000 Kenyan Shillings (KES) to purchase a high-yielding dairy cow. This cow will boost milk production on the farm. As a result, she will have more milk for both consumption and sales. <br \/><br \/>With the money from the additional sales, she will be able to service her loan on time. With increased income from the loan, Florence will be able to cover the high cost of farm production. Many farmers compromise quality because of the high input costs. However, with increased income, Florence will not take such measures. In the long run, her family will realize an improved standard of living.

She is a happy mother, because just a few years ago the greatest joy arrived at her home -- her infant daughter, whom she loves and gives everything for. Gladys farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kitale, in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. For the past 10 years she has been involved in mixed farming, and her main source of income has been growing maize, vegetables, and tomatoes. She also keeps dairy cows and does a side-hustle business. Gladys has been able to provide nutritious food for her family.<br \/><br \/>Although she has made profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with the challenge of timely delivery of produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up. \"I have to do something for my family,\" she said. Gladys mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that helps aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders, to buy a motorbike. Gladys is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads. As a result, transporting her produce to market has been a challenge, which is why she has suffered so many losses. Perishable products, such as milk, vegetables and tomatoes, require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price. Through this loan Gladys is going to achieve her dream and goals. <br \/><br \/>Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Gladys feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva that help women so that they can gain respect and equality. The benefits of this loan are astronomical, because Gladys will never again suffer losses due to delays in the delivery of her produce to the market. In addition, she will increase her sales volume, because she will be able to transport more goods to the market.

Meet Milcah (an ever-smiling mum). She is a smallholder farmer and lives in the Kitale area of Kenya, where she has been practicing farming for the past ten years. Farming has helped her not only to survive, but to become an entrepreneur. At her age that is not common, but she knows that it doesn\u2019t come with an age limit. She is committed, honest, responsible, and works really hard to see her farming business become successful. The Kitale area is a place that has produced some of the world's top elite athletes and is always referred to as the \u201cbread basket\u201d of Kenya, because 90% of maize consumed in Kenya comes from that region. Kitale has good weather patterns that favor crop and dairy farming. <br \/><br \/>Milcah is a very hardworking woman who enjoys farming. Through all the years she has been farming, she has gained much experience and is one of the most respected farmers in her village. Because of the immense knowledge that she has of farming, Milcah offers extension services to other farmers who are new in the business. Being a caring and loving mother, Milcah has taken care of her family, and she has supported them through the profits she has earned from farming. <br \/><br \/>Although Milcah reaps much profit from farming, one challenge that she is facing, which is dragging her down and preventing her from reaching the top of the skies, is the lack of enough land to farm. For this reason, Milcah is seeking a loan of KES 80,000, which will enable her to buy a piece of land and expand her farming activities. Having so much experience in farming, Milcah is sure that she will make good use of the land and double her profit levels. With the profits, she would be able to repay the loan and improve her living conditions. <br \/><br \/>Milcah is sure that if you invest in her, she will be able to realize her dream of having a good quality of life and securing her children's future. Milcah has gone through the repayment schedule and amount, and she is comfortable with the repayment plan. Support the project of an enterprising Kenyan woman!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":54.63,"image":{"id":1964169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a piece of land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-09-17T17:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-17T17:40:02Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Milcah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2346.44},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2415.01},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2485.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2558.24},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2633},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2709.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2789.15},{"due_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2870.66},{"due_date":"2016-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2954.56},{"due_date":"2016-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3040.9},{"due_date":"2016-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3129.77},{"due_date":"2016-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3221.24},{"due_date":"2016-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3315.38},{"due_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3412.27},{"due_date":"2016-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3512},{"due_date":"2016-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3614.64},{"due_date":"2017-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3720.27},{"due_date":"2017-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3829},{"due_date":"2017-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3940.9},{"due_date":"2017-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4056.08},{"due_date":"2017-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4174.68},{"due_date":"2017-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4296.64},{"due_date":"2017-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4422.19},{"due_date":"2017-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4551.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.4},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.78},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.51},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.02},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.81},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.62},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.46},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.32},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.21},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.12},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.06},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.02},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.02},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.04},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.09},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.18},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.44},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.62},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.84},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":28.73,"local_amount":2965.8,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T15:34:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2978.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731024296},{"amount":25.9,"local_amount":2673.81,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:29:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2685.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112330}],"funded_date":"2015-09-25T15:17:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":938180,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is a woman eager to get ahead.

She is a role model, a mentor, and an inspiration to many young farmers in her village, because of her resilience despite personal challenges, and because of her passion to support her family as a primary caregiver. The living conditions in the Kitale area are very tough, and you need to have tough skin in order to survive. Caroline has always shown the resilience to beat all odds.<br \/><br \/>Because of the hardcore poverty in her village, Caroline started practicing mixed farming. She has been doing this for the past 10 years. Caroline's sources of income are a small side-hustle business and selling vegetables, milk, and eggs. These products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, and one problem that she faces is delivering to the market on time. The Kitale area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market. That is why Caroline is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. With the motorbike she will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits, because the products will still be fresh.<br \/><br \/>Caroline is very determined to succeed, and she is much disciplined with her finances.

She is an honest, sensible, charismatic, and hard-working woman. She is a wise farmer who is respected by her neighbors and fellow farmers as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kitale, which is in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. <br \/><br \/>Caroline is happily married and is blessed with a lovely family. For the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, growing maize and vegetables. She also has dairy cows. Caroline has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with the challenge of delivering the produce in a timely manner to the market. This challenge has not discouraged her. She states: \u201cI have to do something for my family.\" <br \/><br \/>Caroline joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She requested a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Caroline is from a remote village that has poor roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables, and tomatoes) that require timely delivery to the market. This loan will help Caroline to achieve her dream and reach her goals. <br \/><br \/>Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Caroline feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva that help women gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. <br \/><br \/>The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Caroline will never suffer losses due to delays in delivering produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market.

She has to work hard and always stay strong, through all of the adversities that may arise. Elizabeth, a youthful 44-year-old mother, is a wise farmer who is respected and seen as a mentor by her neighbors and fellow farmers. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kitale, which is in the Rift valley region of Kenya. Elizabeth is happily married and is blessed with a lovely family. For the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming. She grows maize and vegetables. She also does some \u201cside-hustle\u201d business, and she has dairy cows.<br \/><br \/>Elizabeth has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with the challenge of delivering the produce to the market in a timely manner. This challenge has not made her give up, and she states: \u201cI have to do something for my family.\u201c Elizabeth joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She applied for a loan from Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders, to buy a motorbike. Elizabeth is from a remote village that has poor roads, and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables, and tomatoes), which require timely delivery to the market. This loan will help Elizabeth to achieve her dream and reach her goals.<br \/><br \/>Accessing a financial solution is an uphill battle for women in Kenya, but Elizabeth feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva that help women to gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan will be astronomical, because Elizabeth will never again suffer losses due to delays in delivering her produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume, also, because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. Her income will increase.<br \/><br \/>Elizabeth is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community, because she intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike and help with the farm work. Elizabeth will use the loan to improve her living conditions and assure her children and grandchildren of a secure future.

This municipality, located in the Atl\u00e1ntico department, has indigenous roots, and its ancestral legacy has been infused into the gastronomy.

Being from a marginalized community, she finds that accessing funds is very challenging. However, through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. <br \/><br \/>With the loan, she will be able to provide more eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market. This will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. Being a visionary, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry business to other markets.

She is a farmer in Kitale, growing maize, raising poultry, and engaged in dairy farming. She produces milk and eggs for commercial purposes as opposed to many rural farmers who produce for subsistence. <br \/><br \/>Margaret also grows maize for food and sales. These commercial activities place her in a better position to engage in other agricultural businesses which she does. Margaret is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to construct a cow shed. This will help significantly in managing the animals\u2019 health and hygiene. <br \/><br \/>She has been in the farming business for at least 10 years and has no plans to quit as she finds farming to be not only fulfilling, but also lucrative. However, her biggest challenges are the poor road network and the lack of market.

Mary is a mother who makes sure her children never go to bed hungry. She hails from the Kitale area of Kenya. Mary never got the opportunity to advance her education and get a white collar job but this did not kill her dream of wanting to succeed in life. <br \/><br \/>Mary has been doing farming for the past six years. Throughout those years, she has gathered  much experience and learned important farming techniques. Mary practices mixed farming on her farm and through the profits, she has managed to take care of her family's needs and give her children a good education. Mary believes that education is the only key to success. <br \/><br \/>She is seeking a loan of KES 65,000 to buy seed and start horticulture farming on her farm. Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in her village, good soil and a ready market for horticulture products, Mary wants to take advantage of that and reap more profits. <br \/><br \/>Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring women like Mary to make their farming dreams come to reality through training and loan financing. Mary hopes that through the loan, she will improve her living conditions. Mary's dreams and projections are that by the end of the first year, she will not only be selling in the local market but will also be selling in international markets through exporting fruits and vegetables. Through this, she will be able to assure her children a secure future and uninterrupted learning because she will be able to pay tuition fees on time. <br \/><br \/>Mary is not a selfish woman and will also want to impact positively on society.

become professionals. It is what encourages Frida and fills her with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nFrida has been practicing mixed farming for the past twelve years. On her farm, she grows maize, has two dairy cows, and keeps poultry. She sells milk, eggs, and maize. When she is not farming, she engages in some personal business to help supplement the income she earns.\r\n\r\nDespite her low earnings, farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction. \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\" she says. \r\n\r\nFrida's biggest challenge is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields. For a farmer, this means business losses and lack of food for the family. Because of this challenge, Frida formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro finance organization that supports small rural farmers.\r\n\r\nFrida is seeking a loan to buy a dairy cow and is planning to become a full-fledged dairy farmer. Her future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage. With this loan, Frida is going to grow into a very successful dairy farmer\r\n\r\nAll she wants is for her family to enjoy the abundance of life, good health, and a good livelihood. Frida hopes to succeed thanks to the support from the kind-hearted people who support smallholder farmers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":32.56,"image":{"id":1965060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy another quality dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-09-17T18:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-17T18:40:05Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Frida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.85},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.56,"local_amount":3256.28,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3379.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112349}],"funded_date":"2015-09-29T23:08:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":947923,"name":"Tete Ansanm Colombier","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josiane is a 27-year-old leader who launched a rural organisation, two years ago, in the west Department of Haiti.

In 2014, she raised $721 dollars as the annual profit, after covering the expenses. The people Josiane is working with are operating very small economic activities. More than 50% of them are iron workers, 45% retailers of used clothes, and 5% small shop keepers. Josiane plays a key role in linking her group to Fonkoze to obtain credit via Zafen. The request, if granted, will help Josiane and her co-workers to cope with daily food and the transportation expenses for their children during the new school year.

However, rising costs of farming inputs, such as fertilizers, and fluctuations in market prices are some of the serious challenges that are cutting farmers' profits significantly. Despite these tough conditions, Judy remains positive and passionate about her economic activity. <br \/><br \/>Judy is seeking a loan to purchase poultry.

With this loan, Judy will be able to increase the sales from her poultry business and make more profits. An increase in income for her is timely, since it will enable her to tackle high farm-related costs next season. This will greatly improve the quality of work since the cost of every input will be adequately met. As a result, she will realize better quality produce and more yields.

She has a lovely family and has been doing crop farming for subsistence purposes. She also grows vegetables, a bit of maize and grass for her goats. She is seeking a loan to grow vegetables on a bigger scale for commercial gains. The demand for horticultural products such as fruits and vegetables has grown steadily in Kenya in recent years. As much as they have become one of the top traded agricultural products, there is still plenty of room to expand. <br \/><br \/>Salome is very excited to start commercialization of her crops.

Other than doing some small business, Ruth is a very hardworking farmer who has been farming for the past five years. She has gained so much experience through those years of farming.

Her farm has not been producing as much of a harvest because of the lack of fertilizer and good seeds and the presence of pests and diseases. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy farm implements and buy seeds so as to expand her horticulture farm. Through the loan, Ruth will be assured of a bumper harvest, and this will translate into more profits and cash. Through the use of good seeds and fertilizer, she will increase her profit margins.

Esther, a mother of three, has been practicing farming on a small inherited piece of land for the past six years.\r\n\r\nTo afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs and varieties of food crops from her farmland. To make ends meet and make extra cash, she has been engaging in other small personal businesses.\r\n\r\nThe Chuka area has high demand for poultry products. Like many farmers from her region, Esther finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand, which is really high.\r\n\r\nShe lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, so she is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being from a marginalized community, she finds that accessing funds is very challenging. However, through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, she will be able to provide more eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market. This will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level.\r\n\r\nBeing a visionary mum, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry business to other markets. This will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used to fully repay the loan, permanently change her living conditions, and secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":49.93,"image":{"id":1965123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-09-17T19:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-17T19:30:07Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.85},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.93,"local_amount":4993.33,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:29:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5182.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112351}],"funded_date":"2015-09-18T12:35:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":947735,"name":"Sros's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sros\u2019s group live in a rural village in Kandal province in Cambodia.

She has always had the strength to overcome it and move forward with her children. Irene is one of the hardest-working women on planet earth. She is a 48-year-old go-getter from Kapsara, a remote village in the Kitale area of Kenya. This area has harsh weather conditions and to survive, you must have tough skin. Irene has defied all the odds and has farmed for five years. Her primary sources of income are growing crops and raising animals. She earns additional income through a side hustle business.<br \/><br \/>Irene is content with the farming way of life and is a very enterprising woman. She hasn't had formal employment but always worked hard on her farm to provide her children and family with decent meals. The Kitale area has favorable conditions for horticulture farming which is why she seeks a loan to buy seeds to start horticulture farming. Because of good roads, good climate, and a good transportation network, she is sure that she will reap maximum profits and increase her business.

She passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, she stated, \u201cfeeding my cows.\u201d Her hobby is milking her cow. She sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot meet the demand. \n\nFor this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow; it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will produce between 8 and 12 litres of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profit and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used in repaying the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. \n\nFlorence is very ambitious. In the near future, she intends to start adding value to her milk business by packaging the milk before selling, and she also plans to start selling dairy products.

Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily-rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. \n\nIt is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to give Rose access to a loan that will aid her in growing her horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increasing employment opportunities, and bringing about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With your loan, Rose\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability.

She is a person who has battled to get ahead throughout her life. She is based in Siongiroi, which is a small rural town in the south rift of Kenya. Anna and her husband have been blessed with a lovely family. She is a wise farmer whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. Anna is happily married and blessed with a lovely family. For the past 10 years she has been involved in mixed farming and her main source of income has been growing maize, vegetables, tomatoes. She also keeps dairy cows. Anna has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. Although she has made profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with the challenge of timely delivery of produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up; \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. Anna mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that helps aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Anna is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to market has been a challenge, which is why she has suffered so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price, and through this loan Anna is going to achieve her dream and goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle but Anna feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help women so that they can gain respect and equality.

Meet Catherine, a youthful 20-year-old mum and a wise farmer whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Chuka, in the Central region of Kenya. Catherine is happily married and together with her husband, blessed with a lovely child. For the past five years she has been involved in mixed farming and her primary source of income has been growing maize, fruits, and tomatoes and keeping dairy cows. Catherine has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. <br \/><br \/>Although she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge of timely delivery of the produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family\" she said. Catherine mobilized other women in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. <br \/><br \/>She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Catherine is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge, hence she suffers so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price.  Catherine is going to achieve her dream and goals through this loan. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle but Catherine feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva that help out women so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. <br \/><br \/>The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Catherine will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market and she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market and increase her income level. Catherine is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farm work. With your loan, Catherine will improve her living conditions and assure her child and of a secure future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":73.81,"image":{"id":1972001,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike to transport produce to market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-09-17T20:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-17T20:10:04Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3244.36},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3339.18},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3436.76},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3537.2},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3640.58},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3746.97},{"due_date":"2016-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3856.48},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3969.19},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4085.19},{"due_date":"2016-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4204.57},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4327.45},{"due_date":"2016-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4453.98},{"due_date":"2016-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4584.09},{"due_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4718.06},{"due_date":"2016-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4855.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.09},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.94},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.9},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.89},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.91},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.96},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.15},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.29},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.47},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.68},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.93},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.21},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":73.81,"local_amount":7701.63,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":7735.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112473}],"funded_date":"2015-10-12T20:57:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michael Angelilli","image":1331534}},{"id":945735,"name":"Mihail","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mihail is a 59 years-old, guardian of agricultural products warehouse from Ungheni region in Moldova.

Rose is married to a fellow farmer and has six children. Her family's main income source is milk from their dairy farm. However, they are involved in other agricultural activities such as growing bananas, vegetables, fruits and cereals. <br \/><br \/>The biggest problem being faced by farmers from Nkubu is the huge deficit in access to agricultural inputs, meaning that farmers' yields and incomes are far below what they could be. Juhudi Kilimo partnered with Kiva to provide financial services to smallholders around Kenya. Through these financial services, farmers from Nkubu like Rose now can buy productive assets and important agricultural inputs for use on their farms. <br \/><br \/>Rose is seeking a loan to buy farm inputs such as seeds, fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides. Your loan will enable her to improve her production through the use of quality farm inputs. This intervention will help her fill the increasing demand for food in the market and, in the process, generate more income to repay the loan debt and elevate the quality of life for her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":113.9,"image":{"id":1968419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farm inputs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-09-17T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-17T20:20:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4830.97},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5108.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5257.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5411.49},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5569.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5732.42},{"due_date":"2016-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5899.95},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6072.37},{"due_date":"2016-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6249.84},{"due_date":"2016-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6432.49},{"due_date":"2016-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6620.48},{"due_date":"2016-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":6813.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.58},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.26},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.7},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.18},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.71},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.28},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.89},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.55},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.27},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.03},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.84},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":113.9,"local_amount":11811.75,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":11831.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112376}],"funded_date":"2015-10-17T13:36:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":948091,"name":"Sa Ath","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sa ath, a young farmer, lives with mother in Chhoung Preal village that is far away from power grid.

Economic necessity has driven her to seek alternatives to generate an income that complements what her husband generates to maintain the household. She is a farmer in Nkubu. She engages in milk and egg production for commercial purposes, as opposed to many rural farmers who produce for subsistence. Lilian also grows maize for food and sales. These commercial activities place her in a better position to engage in other agricultural businesses, which, in fact, she does. <br \/><br \/>Lilian is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to construct a cow shed. This will help significantly in managing the animals\u2019 health and hygiene. She has been in the farming business for at least 10 years. She has no plans to quit in the future, as she finds farming to be not only fulfilling, but also lucrative. <br \/><br \/>However, her biggest challenges are the poor road network and the lack of market. With your loan, Lilian will construct a cow shed, which will later come in handy when she scales up and introduces zero-grazing.

She has to work hard and always stay strong through all of the adversities that may arise. Purity is a youthful, 31-year-old farmer from Kanyakine, a remote village in Nkubu area of Kenya where people live in shanties made from whatever materials they can find, usually sheets of corrugated tin. According to residents, the people of Kanyakine are forgotten or ignored by the county government of Nkubu. But within the remote village of Kanyakine Purity is working hard to pull herself out of the dismal conditions. <br \/>She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Nkubu, which is in the central region of Kenya. Purity is blessed with one child. For the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming. She grows maize and vegetables. <br \/><br \/>Purity also has dairy cows. Purity has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with the challenge of delivering the produce to the market in a timely manner. This challenge has not made her give up and she states: \u201cI have to do something for my family\u201c. <br \/><br \/>Purity joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. <br \/><br \/>She applied for a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders, to buy a motorbike. Purity is from a remote village that has poor roads, poor terrain and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables and tomatoes), which require timely delivery to the market. <br \/><br \/>This loan will help Purity to achieve her dream and reach her goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Purity feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva that help women to gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. <br \/><br \/>The benefits of this loan will be astronomical, because Purity will never suffer losses due to a delay in delivering her produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume, because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. Her income will increase. <br \/><br \/>Purity is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike and help with the farm work. Purity will use the loan to improve her living conditions and assure her children of a secure future. <br \/><br \/>Kindly lend to Purity to keep her big smile because she believes that it takes someone to help someone!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":158.78,"image":{"id":1970396,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike to help her deliver her perishable products to the market in a timely manner.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-09-17T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-17T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Purity","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7077.29},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7284.12},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7497},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7716.1},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":7941.61},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":8173.7},{"due_date":"2016-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8412.57},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8658.43},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8911.47},{"due_date":"2016-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":9171.91},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":9439.96},{"due_date":"2016-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":9715.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.02},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.23},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.43},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.69},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.02},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.42},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.89},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.43},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.04},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":158.78,"local_amount":16285.25,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:29:26Z","rounded_local_amount":16537.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112428}],"funded_date":"2015-09-23T00:40:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":942413,"name":"Ann","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nkubu, Kenya has a beautiful landscape made up of endless rolling hills and valleys stretching as far as the eye can see. In her small but clean house Ann has been able to raise two children who give her the determination to keep pushing on even when things get rough.<br \/><br \/>Thanks to practicing mixed farming Ann can see a bright future. Each morning at 5:00 a.m. she arises to go to her farm in the remote village of Nkumbo. Because of her great knowledge of farming, farmers from her village view her as a mentor. Listening to her referring to the different breeds of dairy cows on his compound, one would mistake her for an Agricultural Extension Officer. <br \/><br \/>Demand for beef cattle has been high and Ann wants to take advantage of the market. Therefore, she is seeking a loan to buy a quality breed of beef cow. Beef farming is another profitable agricultural venture in Kenya and Ann has already identified the breed of beef cow that she wants. Ann always says that, \u201cTo become a successful beef farmer, one does not need to be a livestock expert. All one needs is passion, information, and keenness to learn from the successful farmers.\u201d Marketing of her beef cattle to butcheries and slaughter houses will not be a challenge, because she will sell the beef directly to the market and also to big slaughtering houses. Through the loan, Ann will not only benefit from income, but will also benefit from manure (cow dung) that will be used in improving the fertility of her farm, thus saving money that would have been spent buying fertilizer. Ann has been facing challenges in accessing finances, but feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via KIVA are there to make her dream come true. Ann chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loan is low and is on a reducing basis. Ann underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and during the training season she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro finance institutions. Through accumulated profits Ann plans to permanently improve her living conditions, and to secure the future of her school-aged children by paying tuition fees for them. She plans that through increased income, she will be able to buy more beef cows and build a slaughter house."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1970550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality breed of beef cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-09-17T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-17T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":6451.22},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6639.76},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":6833.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":7033.52},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":7239.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":7450.64},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7668.38},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":7892.49},{"due_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":8123.15},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":8360.55},{"due_date":"2016-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":8604.89},{"due_date":"2016-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":8856.36},{"due_date":"2016-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":9115.19},{"due_date":"2016-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":9381.58},{"due_date":"2016-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":9655.76},{"due_date":"2017-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":9937.95},{"due_date":"2017-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":10228.38},{"due_date":"2017-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":10527.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.36},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.06},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.98},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.02},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.13},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.29},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.52},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.82},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.18},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.61},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.11},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.69},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.34},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.07},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.88},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":948130,"name":"Sody's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sody is a 39-year-old married woman with three children.

Meet Annah, who is happily married and has been practicing mixed farming for the last five years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her 3 children, she has been selling eggs and varieties of food crops from her farmland. The Nandi Hills area is very populated, and the demand for poultry products and eggs is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable. She stated that what she like best is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand, which is really high. <br \/><br \/>She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES to buy poultry. Being a woman, she finds that accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. As a result of the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to an increased profit margin and an improved income level.

She has no higher education or work experience, only her wits and her desire to succeed in life. She is a very hardworking, progressive, and honest farmer from a very remote village in Kiminini in the Kitale area of Kenya. This area is very fertile, with favorable weather patterns that support farming activities. <br \/><br \/>Mary is happily married and the proud mother of a lovely family, and together they live on a small piece of land that she really treasures. Her primary sources of income are eggs and milk. Although this humble and industrious mother makes a profit, she faces the challenge of not being able to produce enough to meet the ready market that is available. Therefore, she is seeking funds from Kiva lenders to buy farm inputs like good fertilizer and good-quality seeds. <br \/><br \/>Through this loan, she will double her production, and this will translate into increased income. She then intends to save more money in the future so that she can develop her farming.

Meet Rose, a 25-year-old who is humble, honest and a very hardworking mum on this planet Earth. Rose has a lovely family, whom she really adores. She will always do anything good to prevent them from ever going to bed with hungry stomachs. <br \/><br \/>Rose hails from the Kericho area of Kenya. She never got the opportunity to advance her education and get a white collar job, but these realities did not kill her dream of wanting to succeed in life. Rose has been farming for the past five years. Through the years, she has gathered much experience, and all the farming techniques are at her fingertips. Rose practices mixed farming (dairy, animal and crop farming). With her profits, she has managed to take care of her family's needs. She is very enterprising and she is seeking a loan of KES 10,000 to buy seeds and start horticulture farming. Rose wants to take advantage of various conditions such as favorable weather patterns, a good road network in her village, good soil and a ready market for horticulture products to reap more profits. <br \/><br \/>Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring women like Rose turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Rose hopes that she will improve her living conditions through this loan.

She is committed, honest, responsible, and works really hard to see her farming business become successful. The Nandi Hills area is a place that has produced some of the world's top elite athletes. Nandi Hills has good weather patterns that favor crop and dairy farming. <br \/><br \/>Consollata is a very hardworking woman who enjoys farming. Through all the years she has been farming, she has gained much experience and is one of the most respected farmers in her village. Because of the immense knowledge that she has of farming, she offers extension services to other farmers who are new in the business. Being a caring and loving mother, she has been able to take care of her family and support them through the profits she has earned from farming. <br \/><br \/>Although Consollata reaps much profit from farming, one challenge that she is facing that is dragging her down and preventing her from reaching the top of the skies is lack of enough land to farm. For this reason, Consollata is seeking a loan of 20,000 KES to be able to buy a piece of land and expand her farming activities. Having so much experience in farming, Consollata is sure that she will make good use of the land and double her profit levels.

However, to start her own business, Davlatmo needs to buy her own sewing machine.<br \/><br \/>To carry out these plans, Davlatmo has applied for a loan, with which she will purchase a \"Yamata\" brand electric sewing machine and other sewing accessories.

This was true for Lucy, who is based in the Chuka area of Kenya. She has now been practicing mixed farming for the past three years and has managed to earn a decent income. Her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. <br \/><br \/>Lucy passionately loves dairy farming and, when asked what is most enjoyable about it, she stated, \u201cFeeding my cows.\u201d Her hobby is milking her cow. Lucy sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming and she cannot meet it. For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed that will produce between ten and twenty liters of milk a day. <br \/><br \/>This extra production will immediately translate to more profit margins and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used to repay the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase Lucy's business enterprise. Lucy is very visionary and she intends, in the near future, to start adding value to her milk business by packaging the milk before selling it. She also plans to start selling dairy products such as yogurt. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future.
