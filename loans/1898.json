This is Zipora, a woman with grand aspirations. She is both humble and grateful and lives in the Nandi Hills area of Kenya, renowned for its rolling hills carpeted in manicured tea plantations. <br \/><br \/>Zipora is the mother of 5 lovely children, and she has been in the agriculture business for 15 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs, and vegetables. <br \/><br \/>Zipora has been relying on agriculture to provide all of her income. However, the rising costs of farming inputs (such as fertilizers) and fluctuations in market prices are some of the serious challenges that are cutting farmers' profits significantly. <br \/><br \/>Despite these tough conditions, Zipora remains positive and passionate about her economic activity. She is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. This will enable her to expand the section of business least affected by harsh external conditions. Poultry farming is cheaper to run and the demand for chicken products is always high. <br \/><br \/>With this loan, Zipora will be able to increase the sales from her poultry business and earn more profits.

Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. <br \/><br \/>That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. <br \/><br \/>Kenya's Nandihills area, one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Decla could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there.

Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily-rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. <br \/><br \/>It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with KIVA to give Theresa access to a loan that will aid her in growing her horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increasing employment opportunities, and bringing about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With your loan, Theresa\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business.  Lenders, if there is someone you should consider lending to, then that person is Theresa!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":81.2,"image":{"id":1969492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy seeds and grow her horticulture farming business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-09-18T02:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-18T02:30:04Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Theresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3440.65},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3541.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3644.69},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3751.21},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3860.84},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3973.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4089.8},{"due_date":"2016-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4209.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4332.35},{"due_date":"2016-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4458.96},{"due_date":"2016-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4589.27},{"due_date":"2016-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4723.39},{"due_date":"2016-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4861.43},{"due_date":"2016-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5003.51},{"due_date":"2016-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5149.74},{"due_date":"2017-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5300.24},{"due_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5455.16},{"due_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5614.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.3},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.31},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.34},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.4},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.49},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.62},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.78},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.97},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.2},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.46},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.76},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.09},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.47},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.89},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.35},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.85},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":81.2,"local_amount":8381.9,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:29:23Z","rounded_local_amount":8434.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112409}],"funded_date":"2015-10-17T17:47:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":941708,"name":"Teresia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresia is a responsible and diligent smallholder farmer from Kenyenya village who is involved in dairy farming.

To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs and varieties of food crops from her farmland.

Being a woman accessing funds is very challenging, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":46.87,"image":{"id":1976081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-09-18T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-18T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.85},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":46.87,"local_amount":4686.53,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:29:50Z","rounded_local_amount":4949.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112550}],"funded_date":"2015-09-22T13:49:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":948300,"name":"Shefaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"After five years of home business Shefaa decide to move her salon from her house to a regular salon shop next door, in her district.

St. Jude Namugoona School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nSt. Jude Namugoona School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

Su sue\u00f1o es mejorar sus ventas, ella desea comprar material de trabajo para fabricar cotillones y adornar muchas fiestas en fin de a\u00f1o.

She is single and has three children, ages 4, 7, and 10. Her business is selling party favors.\r\n\r\nShe is friendly, generous, and very responsible. Her business is done in the Coloca area, which is formed by farmers who were living in the meadows of the area, where little towns and hamlets stand out as white points in the middle of the plain.\r\n\r\nSonia is dark, of short stature, with long black hair. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed, and she speaks Spanish. (She is standing in the center left, wearing a black sweater.) She shares her life with her children, who go to school. They live in their own house made of wood, which [of the basic services] has only electricity. The need to improve her business led her to form a bank for business ventures with [people having] businesses such as selling food, selling vegetables, cleaning service, selling soft drinks, weaving palm frond hats, neighborhood store, and selling natural medicines. Her business is selling party favors. These are decorations and entertaining objects that are usually used to decorate for parties. They are made of every color according to the event. \"For the approaching holidays at the end of the year, the places are decorated with joke items, favors for the tree, or little nativity figures,\" she comments. The advantage of her business is that she has busy seasons. The problem is the lack of capital for the purchase of work materials such as poster board, colored paper, ribbons, glue, and other items. Her dream is to improve her sales. She wants to buy work materials to make party favors and decorate many parties at the end of the year. This is her first loan sequence with the institution in the three years that she has been doing this work.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that Sonia is applying for a loan to purchase work materials to make party favors and decorate for the parties that are coming.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1698.88,"image":{"id":1978587,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy work materials to make party favors and decorations for the coming holidays","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-09-18T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-18T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":4350,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Rene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sindy Lubitza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melby","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth Benjamin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ericka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-18T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-01T04:00:00Z","amount":2259.53},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T04:00:00Z","amount":2300.65},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T04:00:00Z","amount":2342.52},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T04:00:00Z","amount":2385.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T04:00:00Z","amount":2428.57},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":2472.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T04:00:00Z","amount":2517.77},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T04:00:00Z","amount":2563.6},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T04:00:00Z","amount":2610.26},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T04:00:00Z","amount":2657.76},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T04:00:00Z","amount":2706.14},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T04:00:00Z","amount":2755.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.63},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.59},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":339.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":345.85},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":352.14},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":358.55},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":365.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":371.72},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":378.49},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":385.38},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":392.39},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":399.51}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1698.88,"local_amount":11716.43,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:07:54Z","rounded_local_amount":11721.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752077182}],"funded_date":"2015-10-07T07:12:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":947943,"name":"Elen Angelica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia Elen Angelica  se sigue dedicando al negocio de venta de productos de belleza y tambien la socia ahora esta vendiedno ropa como pantalones,casacas y chompas, la socia es una persona trabajadora y emprendedora que por medio de este negocio la socia saca adelante a su familia.La socia solicita el cr\u00e9dito para comprar casacas,polos,chompas y pantalones.\n\nLa socia est\u00e1 feliz por el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con los pagos de su cuota.","en":"Group member Elen Angelica still has her business selling beauty products and she is also now selling clothing, such as pants, coats, and sweaters.

Her business is making wool blankets; she buys sheep, llama, and alpaca wools to make artisanal loomed blankets: \"I started this work because my friends encourage me to and they were my first customers,\" she tells us.  The good thing about her business is that her sales are constant, the problem is a lack of capital to buy wool wholesale.  Her dream is to open a weaving workshop.  She wants to buy different kinds of wool wholesale to make blankets.  This is her first loan cycle with the institution in her 8 years of doing business. <br \/><br \/>For these reasons Elena is requesting a loan to buy llama wool wholesale to make blankets."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":98.06,"image":{"id":1978683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy llama wool wholesale to make blankets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-09-18T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-18T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-19T04:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":4500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-10T04:00:00Z","amount":343.85},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T04:00:00Z","amount":295.68},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T04:00:00Z","amount":325.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T04:00:00Z","amount":333.86},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T04:00:00Z","amount":338.98},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T04:00:00Z","amount":362.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T04:00:00Z","amount":381.4},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T04:00:00Z","amount":388.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T04:00:00Z","amount":413.01},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T04:00:00Z","amount":426.26},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T04:00:00Z","amount":444.97},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T04:00:00Z","amount":445.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.35},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.82},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.85},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.37},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.21},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.21},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.95},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.94},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.75},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":53.64,"local_amount":357.57,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-23T12:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":370.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":732297036},{"amount":44.42,"local_amount":296.13,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:07:55Z","rounded_local_amount":306.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752077184}],"funded_date":"2015-09-18T08:28:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alyson Trowbridge","image":null}},{"id":941800,"name":"Alice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meet Alice, a young farmer from Nandihills County in Kenya who has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture.

School, a mixed school in the rural area of Kakamiro in Kibaale with 800 students. Kings Way S. School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 1,000 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nKings Way S. School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Josephat ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1979341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kibaale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-09-18T04:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-18T04:20:03Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kings Way S.

Her primary source of income is milk and also she plants different varieties of food crops. She also engages in some personal business and has been able to earn a handsome profit from the venture. <br \/><br \/>Elizabeth practices agriculture with a difference, employing youthful energy, enthusiasm and knowledge from the many agricultural training classes she has been attending to broaden her skills. Although she earns handsome profits from farming, she faces one big challenge, and that is the high price of fertilizers, seedlings and inputs. This is a result of the monopoly that is enjoyed by the only Agrovet shop in her area. <br \/><br \/>She is therefore requesting a loan to start an Agrovet shop. Soy area has only one agro dealer, which is catering to thousands of smallholder farmers who depend solely on that dealer for agricultural inputs. The agro dealer has been making a killing from farmers by charging them higher prices because they are the only agro dealer and have a monopoly. Elizabeth wants to change this and seize the business opportunity, and through your loan she will start an Agrovet shop and tap into the potential agricultural market. She will also help the smallholder farmers in her area, who have long been having a serious problem accessing affordable farm inputs. <br \/><br \/>Through your loan, Elizabeth will change from the peasant farmer she is right now to a certified agro dealer. Through increased income from the loan, she will improve her living conditions, and her future plans are to purchase a truck which will be used to engage farmers in output marketing activities. <br \/><br \/>Elizabeth believes that there is no doubt that youths like her can find rewarding employment in farming.

This is Robert. He is an administrator at St. Andrew's Secondary School, a mixed school in the Urban area of Mbarara with 500 students. St. Andrew's School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nSt. Andrew's School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

She also engages in some personal business to supplement her meager income. She passionately loves dairy farming and has even nicknamed one of her cows. Waking up every day in the morning to milk her cow makes her feel very fulfilled and proud. The biggest challenge she faces is feeding her cows and satisfying the largely unsatisfied milk market, and therefore she is seeking a loan to start zero grazing (stall feeding her dairy cows).<br \/> <br \/>Through the loan, she will be able to build a profitable business enterprise. Zero grazing will allow her make more money in selling milk, and she projects that milk will be selling at 45 KES (Kenyan shillings) per liter and KES 55 for fermented milk. An increase in income means she will be able to comfortably support her large household and secure her children's future.<br \/><br \/>Judith is also a mobilizer, and she has mobilized other women in her village and formed the \u201cTop juu\u201d self-help group, and together they have undergone training on technical and financial management.

She is a mother who is hardworking, humble and responsible. Since she was a girl, she learned to do all of the tasks involved in farming, thanks to her parents' teaching. She is a smallholder farmer based in Kenyenya, Kenya, which is a town near the famous Lake Victoria. Rose and her husband are blessed with a lovely family. <br \/><br \/>Rose has been a farmer for more than ten years. She keeps poultry for eggs, cows for milk, and grows maize and vegetables for sale. She also engages in small businesses on the side whenever an opportunity crosses her path. Despite the rapid fluctuation of prices in the market, Rose is very passionate and optimistic about the future of farming in Kenya. <br \/><br \/>Rose is seeking a loan to expand her farm. She intends to buy farm implements. This move is quite a big deal for her. With a loan, Rose seeks to continue growing a variety of crops, but on a greater scale.

Like many farmers in her village, she also plants trees on her farm to complement the region's natural forests. Although Caroline makes profits selling her farm produce at the market, the biggest challenge she faces is lack of water to irrigate her farm and water for home consumption.

Because of her age, she faces challenges carrying water on her back. <br \/><br \/>Caroline is seeking a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes. Most of the farmers in Kenya depend on rain fed agriculture but Caroline wants to change that notion and start irrigation farming. Through the loan she intends to harvest rain water which always goes to waste and store it in the tanks. She intends to buy pipes that will be used to pump water from the river directly to her farm. With your loan Caroline will be saved the trouble of walking a long distance in search of water and she will have enough water for home consumption. Irrigating her farm will boast productivity since water is an important requirement in the germination of crops. Caroline is very excited about this project and hopes her dream will be achieved through the loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders.

That is why she is seeking a loan to buy farm implements and buy seeds so as to expand her horticulture farm. Through the loan, Martha will be assured of a bumper harvest, and this will translate into more profits and cash. Through the use of good seeds and fertilizer, she will increase her profit margins.

But within the remote village of Kipkoibon Evaline is working hard to pull herself out of the dismal conditions. Most small-holder farmers view Evaline as a role model and a mentor because of the resilience that she has despite personal challenges, and her passion to support her four children as a primary caregiver. <br \/><br \/>Evaline started farming in 2007 after the country suffered post-election violence. With the unstinting support of her husband, who dedicated his 2 acres, she has grown the business dramatically. She has acquired numerous income-generating assets, including farm machines. She keeps dairy cattle and grows subsistence and commercial crops, such as maize avacodos and tea. She takes pride in being independent and being involved in a sector that feeds the population. <br \/><br \/>Evaline is seeking a loan to purchase more land. Her operations are growing consistently, eating up the available space. The money from the investment will be ploughed back into the business, to finance even more growth. The additional income will also enable her to repay the loan, buy food for her family, and pay fees for her four children who are in public schools.

Being a woman, she finds that accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. As a result of the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to an increased profit margin and an improved income level.

School, a mixed school in the Rural area of Ibanda with 450 students. Rwentojo School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nRwentojo School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Laudel ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1979314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ibanda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.116667 30.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-09-18T13:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-18T13:00:04Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rwentojo S.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nKimunyu Memorial School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

Rose is happily married and together with her husband they are blessed with four  children. Her primary source of income is milk and also she plants maize on her farm. <br \/><br \/> Although she earns handsome profits from farming she faces one big challenge and that is high prices in fertilizers, seedlings and inputs and this is a result of the monopoly that is enjoyed by the only agro vet shop in her area. She is requesting a loan to start an agro vet shop. Mosop area has only one agro dealer who is catering for thousands of smallholder farmers who solely depend on him for agricultural inputs. The agro dealer has been making a big profit from farmers by charging them extra amounts since he is the only agro dealer and enjoys monopoly. <br \/><br \/>Rose wants to change this and seize the business opportunity and through your loan she will start an agro vet shop and tap into the potential agricultural market. Rose will also help the smallholder farmers in his area who for a long time have been having a serious problem accessing affordable farm inputs. Through your loan Rose will change from the peasant farmer she is right now, to a certified agro dealer who will be depended on by nearly one thousand smallholder farmers in her area both for input, knowledge and information about improved inputs.

Catherine farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kitale, in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. For the past 10 years she has been involved in mixed farming and her main source of income has been growing maize, vegetables and tomatoes. <br \/><br \/>Although she has made profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with the challenge of timely delivery of produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up; \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. Catherine mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that helps aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan to buy a motorbike. <br \/><br \/>Catherine is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to market has been a challenge, which is why she has suffered so many losses.

Shaheen therefore decided for the sake of the family income that she should purchase a new auto rickshaw, a vehicle she knows is available at a low cost, and give it to her son, who can then earn an income by driving it.\r\n\r\nShaheen has been putting money into savings for a long time in order to buy a new auto rickshaw for her son, and she has requested a loan for the rest of the needed funds so that her son can obtain the vehicle and start his business.\r\n \r\nShe is hopeful that her son will be able to generate some income through this new business and help his family. She is very happy to receive this loan. \r\n\r\nShaheen offers her thanks to Kiva and its field partner BRAC

With this loan she can buy 70 water filters and sell them again. 70 filters will provide approximately 350 people with safe drinking water."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":390.53,"image":{"id":1868578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Water and Sanitation"],"use":"to buy water filters in order to provide her neighbors with safe drinking water.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Malang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":263,"posted_date":"2015-09-18T14:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-18T14:50:07Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erni ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":15564400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":15564400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":390.53,"local_amount":5525800,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:23:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5640873.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731049218}],"funded_date":"2015-09-18T18:10:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":948614,"name":"Serason Indah Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"After undergoing a period of loan, Ni Wayan repaid their loans on time. <br \/><br \/>Now Ni Wayan has a new activity.

Selling her milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also be selling to big dairy processing firms. <br \/><br \/> She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from this training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. Faith hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-going children. It is clear that this smallholder farmer is determined to reach her goal, and her request should be considered.

San Clemente is known for its beautiful beaches that are much visited by many national and international tourists. The town offers a variety of beautiful places to visit, and a rich selection of typical dishes from the region.<br \/><br \/>And it is here that 40-year-old Siria lives. She is married and has three children, ages eleven, six and three years old respectively. All three attend school or nursery. Siria's husband is a fisherman.<br \/><br \/>Siria is a great housewife who is taking out this loan so that her husband may buy the necessary resources to do a great job. Siria's husband works as a fisherman; he goes out to the high seas and fishes with one colleague. The two go out in the morning and come back in the afternoon; sometimes they stay out until the next day with the goods that they collect from the sea. <br \/><br \/>Siria hopes to use half of this loan in order to buy cola drinks, water juices and beers as three days of local festivals are approaching and these products sell very well during this time.

We expect that within two more seasons, he will be able to operate his existing business fully without the need to take on debt.\n\nLast week, Jean Bosco was given the opportunity to grow even more. Three additional rice cooperatives, working with about 2,000 small holder farmers, signed an agreement to supply Jean Bosco with more paddy rice. These cooperatives previously supplied one of his competitors, but the cooperatives were so impressed with the technical agronomy support that Jean Bosco provides that they switched to him.\n\nTo work with these new suppliers, Jean Bosco needs a short-term loan of $40,000 to finish out the remainder of the year.  Like his previous loans, we expect that he will repay his loan fully and on-time, if not early. Jean Bosco is so confident in his ability to repay, that he has already submitted a check in the full amount dated November 30, 2015.\n\nAgain, we are so pleased to support this amazing entrepreneur, and we are so thankful for your support of this loan.

She has also invested in poultry farming and other side-businesses to earn additional income. <br \/><br \/>Charity has improved the half an acre farm tremendously and employs someone to help her run the farm. She has a strategy in place that involves leveraging the business to ensure continuous growth of the farm into the future. She requests a loan to buy seeds and promote crop production. She will be able to secure more land space and farm supplies once the loan request is granted.

Agnes is a farmer and salesperson who has access to many sellers throughout the food business. On her farm she keeps cows and has a small cash crop garden and trees. To earn additional income, Agnes makes a commission on sales for which she helps arrange the logistics of getting farm produce from local farmers to their buyers. She has been doing this business for over a decade. She continually makes an effort to build strong relationships, because reputation is everything in her line of work. <br \/><br \/>Given that Agnes can arrange a sale more easily than regular farmers, she prefers to deal with larger volumes of produce.

At age 27, he spends every day of the week on his mixed farm, tirelessly working. He is one of the most hardworking and dedicated men on planet Earth. He is based in Kamwimbi, a remote village in the Chuka area of Kenya. He is happily married to Mukami, who adds additional income to support their family. They have two children. <br \/><br \/>For the past ten years, he has been engaged in mixed farming, and through selling milk, eggs, and a variety of food crops, he has earned a decent income. Like many farmers in his village, he also plants trees on his farm to complement the region's natural forests. <br \/><br \/>Although Charles makes profits selling his farm produce at the market, the biggest challenge he faces is lack of water to irrigate his farm and water for home consumption. Charles comes from an area where there is no water connection, and he is always forced to walk for a long distance for this \u201cprecious commodity\". Charles faces challenges carrying water on his back because of his failing health. <br \/><br \/>Charles is seeking a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes. Most of the farmers in Kenya depend on rain-fed agriculture, but Charles wants to change that notion and start irrigation farming. Through the loan, he intends to harvest rain water (which always goes to waste) and store it in the tank. He intends to buy pipes that will be used to pump water from the river directly to his farm. With your loan, Charles will be saved the trouble of walking a long distance in search of water, and he will have enough water for home consumption. Irrigating his farm will boost productivity, since water is an important requirement in the germination of crops. <br \/><br \/>Charles is very excited about this project and hopes his dream will be achieved through the loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders. Increased productivity means increased income, and this will translate to improved living standards. He will use the additional income to improve and secure the future of his children. Charles\u2019 hope for the future is to live a fulfilling life.<br \/><br \/>Kindly make a loan to him!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":38.27,"image":{"id":1963467,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a water tank and water pipes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-09-18T18:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-18T18:00:04Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1747.34},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1822.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1876.02},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1930.85},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1987.28},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2045.36},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2105.13},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2166.65},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2229.97},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2295.17},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2362.22},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2431.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.47},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.23},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.76},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.31},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.87},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.46},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.05},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.3},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.95},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.62},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":38.27,"local_amount":3827.03,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:29:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4049,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112328}],"funded_date":"2015-09-20T00:04:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":948833,"name":"Rami","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rami is an example of an ambitious guy.
