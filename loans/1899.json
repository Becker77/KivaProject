She is a mother of five. Like many farmers in the region, she has a dairy cow. Kitale has a thriving market for dairy products. Fridah has sustained herself through dairy farming for seven years now. She enjoys the farming lifestyle. She has a connection with farm animals that goes so deep that she even names each of them. She has aspirations of expanding her dairy farm, but due to financial constraints, she has been unable to do so until now.<br \/><br \/>From Kiva lenders, Fridah is borrowing KES 45,000 to purchase a high yielding dairy cow.

This university is not just rich for qualified faculty and big library, but also gives a lot of opportunities for creativity and expanding horizons of students. I love AUCA spirit and value with the opportunity to meet many international students and staff here. The only problem is that my family is facing difficulties with payment of my tuition fee.<br \/><br \/>I have a very amicable and friendly family of four: father, mother, me and my 14-year-old sister. My father is not able to work due to his health problems. My mother is a teacher, I think, she is born to be a teacher. I love my family very much, whenever there is a difficult situation, my parents are the first people, whom I can rely on. Having financial problems is usual for my family as my mother is the only breadwinner. But my parents always strongly believe that education is the biggest wealth for human beings. That is why despite any financial difficulties, I joined AUCA community. I was told about financial aid and Kiva loan. I was so surprised to find such an interest-free loan, and for sure decided to apply for it. I hope that I will be one of the people whose future becomes brighter thanks to Kiva lenders.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1980267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for his higher education costs at AUCA","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bishkek","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":326,"posted_date":"2015-09-18T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-18T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"German","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":70,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-09-22T02:30:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":948944,"name":"Twaha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Twaha, who is in his late 30s, is married with three kids; one of them is still small  and the other two are still in school.

This in turn is a product of the poor road network. However what the region loses in accessibility it gains in natural resources as it is surrounded by fields full of sweet sugar cane and trees that produce fresh fruit and pure air. <br \/>   <br \/>In this community the group called \"Sigue Adelante\" was formed made up of hard-working women who day by day strive to provide the best for their families. They are: Sandra, Emilia and Bartola who sell groceries; Faustina, soft drinks and food; Mar\u00eda A. and Marina, cosmetics; Mar\u00eda B., shoes; Isabel, chicken; Antonia, sheep; Maribel and P\u00e1nfila, soft drinks; Claudia, food; Irma, clothing; while Minerva and Josefina work raising pigs.<br \/><br \/>Emiliana is an example of effort and work as she currently takes care of two of her grandchildren who are her motivation to sell soft drinks and snacks in order to have income. For her, her grandchildren are like her children and she wants them to have the opportunity to study to be professionals. She started as with any business with a small quantity of product. In this case two cases of soft drinks. However currently two big brands have given her refrigerators due to the success she has achieved. Later she started the sales of groceries and she is now thinking of adding fresh chicken to compliment her activities. \"Every day I get up and thank God for all he has given me and I ask him for the strength to still be standing to help my family,' she commented contently. <br \/>   <br \/>This is the first loan she has received and she will invest it in buying soft drinks of different sizes and flavors to satisfy the needs of her customers. The profits will allow her to pay for the registration of her grandchildren and buy school supplies. <br \/>    <br \/>\u201cHave confidence in us as a group and give us this opportunity. You can be assured that we will not let you down\u201d are the words of the members who show great enthusiasm.<br \/> <br \/>*The photograph was taken in Claudia's house. Emiliana is wearing a green blouse and grey pants."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1091.25,"image":{"id":1973259,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy soft drinks in different sizes and flavors.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Ejido Joya De La Pita.

Because it\u2019s now the rainy season in the Philippines, she is experiencing some challenges in her business due to the increasing price of fish and other seafoods. But she\u2019s not discouraged; instead she wants to prepare for any situation. She desires to have additional capital of PHP 10,000 to buy volume quantities and different varieties of fish while it\u2019s not that expensive. She will also set aside some amount for emergency situations like typhoons when there\u2019s no chance to catch any fish. She plans to have an alternative enterprise like selling cooked viands and snacks. This way, she can still earn some money even during rainy days and she can still sustain their usual everyday needs. You can be the answer to her prayers through your generous support. Thank you so much in advance.<br \/><br \/>Contessa is married to Ralph, a driver, and they have two children who are studying. She works persistently in order to see her children get a college diploma and stable jobs someday.

Barry runs a local palm oil mill in his village. This mill has been a source of support for him and his family and other members of the village who are mostly farmers. At the moment the mill lacks a fiber separator; equipment that is used to separate kernels from fiber. This is very challenging because it takes lots of hours to separate them using the manual process. To reduce his frustration and that of his clients and to also make life easier for the manual workers who make their daily living at this mill, Barry is requesting this loan from Nke-Anyi Farmers Multipurpose Cooperative Society.

Her 65-year-old husband, Antonio, is a regular mechanic who has been working really hard for his family. Now both of them are in their retirement age and they want to give more attention to improving their hog raising or fattening business. <br \/><br \/>Hog raising is a promising enterprise but the return of investment takes after several months. Norma plans to enhance her business with the aid of additional capital worth PHP 20,000 that she can use to buy more piglets, feeds, medicines and vitamins. As soon as her husband retires, he will join her in nurturing the pigs. <br \/><br \/>Norma is not worried about the repayment because one fattened hog is soon ready for selling and she can recover her capital. As she continues to develop her business, she tries to save for her dream of acquiring an improved house and lot.

This is Fr. Felix. He is an administrator at St. Joseph's Model School, a mixed school in the Rural area of Rubindi in Mbarara with 400 students. St. Joseph's Model School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nSt. Joseph's Model School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

In addition to sales from their stand, her husband also sells as an itinerant vendor and travels to big markets of various large villages and regions. \r\n\r\nThe spouses have a goal of building a house for their family since at present they are renting their place of residence. Voahine Florine tries to put some money aside in order to be able to reach this goal.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1974829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

This is Gerald. He is an Administrator at Lungujja Progressive School. This is a mixed school in the urban area of Lungujja in Kampala with 500 students. Lungujja Progressive School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for his students. The school does not currently have consistent access to clean drinking water. Instead, they have to spend a considerable portion of their budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will save the school money in the long-term as the cost for firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 1000 liter tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nLungujja Progressive School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Gerald ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance. Clean water will help reduce the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students attending school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1979327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for his students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-09-19T04:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-19T04:00:07Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lungujja Progressive School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5160000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1032000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-09-19T10:05:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kendall Waldron","image":1958661}},{"id":948412,"name":"Mujeres Luchadoras De San Francisco Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este es el grupo \u201cMUJERES LUCHADORAS DE SAN FRANCISCO\u201d conformada por 05 socias con deseos de trabajar y mejorar su calidad de vida.

She's working 12 to 14 hours a day to fulfill her dream. Dinah, a wife and mother of two children, is a mixed small-scale farmer based in the remote village of Seum, Kitale. <br \/><br \/>She has been practicing agribusiness for the past nine years and has never looked back. For a living, Dinah sells milk and food products from her farm into the local market. She makes extra money doing a side hustle business. She enjoys seeing clients coming back for more of her products and she really feels satisfied. <br \/><br \/>Although Dinah has been making profits through farming, she has always wanted to do poultry farming. The main challenge she has encountered is a lack of funds to get her business off the ground. Dinah is seeking a loan to buy quality breeds of poultry. <br \/><br \/>Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in Kitale and is a business that can be done on a part-time basis to earn extra income. Dinah does not worry too much about competition because the market for poultry products is good - chicken is a popular meal for many people and this can be seen if you visit any fast food joint. <br \/><br \/>With this loan, Dinah is confident that her income will increase and this will allow a permanent change in her life. She plans to buy different breeds of broilers and layers and will be selling eggs and meat to the local market and other major markets in Kenya. She also plans to start breeding, which will help increase the number of poultry on her farm. <br \/><br \/>Other than profits from selling eggs, poultry feathers, and poultry meat, Dinah will also benefit from using the poultry manure, which is an excellent source of nutrients for her farm.

Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the high demand. <br \/><br \/>She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 50,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman and accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved and that she will be able to buy more poultry. <br \/><br \/>As a result of the loan, she will sell more eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to an increased profit margin and an improved income level. <br \/><br \/>Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry market to other markets; this will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used to fully repay the loan, change her living conditions, and secure the future of her children.<br \/><br \/>With your help, this woman will be able to achieve her goals. Be inspired, make a loan!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":48.21,"image":{"id":1974341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to pay for poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-09-19T12:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-19T12:00:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2150.41},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2213.26},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2277.94},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2344.51},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2413.03},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2483.55},{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2556.13},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2630.83},{"due_date":"2016-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2707.72},{"due_date":"2016-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2786.85},{"due_date":"2016-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2868.3},{"due_date":"2016-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2952.12},{"due_date":"2016-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3038.4},{"due_date":"2016-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3127.2},{"due_date":"2016-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3218.59},{"due_date":"2017-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3312.65},{"due_date":"2017-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3409.4},{"due_date":"2017-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3509.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.43},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.03},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.64},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.27},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.59},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.28},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.99},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.72},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.48},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.25},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.05},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.86},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.71},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.58},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.47},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.39},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.21,"local_amount":5074.24,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:29:42Z","rounded_local_amount":5115.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112510}],"funded_date":"2015-09-20T02:48:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":948421,"name":"Lupe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lupe es una mujer de 42 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su pareja, tiene 1 hijo de 7 a\u00f1os y su negocio es la venta de comida.\nElla es buena madre, conservadora y de muy buena actitud.

Speaking with Marion, it becomes obvious that she is a very hardworking and helpful woman, and that everything she does is for her family's benefit and wellbeing. <br \/><br \/>She lives in a humble home in the town of Chuka, along with a handsome husband and three angelic-looking children. She has always tried to give them a decent life and a good education. <br \/><br \/>Marion started farming five years ago on a small inherited piece of land. Today, this humble mother sells milk, eggs and a variety of food crops. Marion also does some side hustle business. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has of farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. <br \/><br \/>Dairy farming is close to her heart and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit and buy a chaff cutter. A good dairy unit provides a good place where cows can relax and it protects them from diseases that may arise because of being exposed to harsh weather conditions such as rain. <br \/><br \/>Through the loan, she will also be able to buy a chaff cutter, which is a mechanical device used in cutting hay into small pieces before it is mixed with other forage for better feeding of the cow.

They are doing this business for ten years already.\n\nCharcoal making and selling is common in Davao because it is used in grilling pork, chicken, and other street foods. It is also used in household cooking as alternative to LPG and electric stove.\n\nAside from charcoal wholesaling, Carmelita also raises hogs in her backyard. She tries to earn higher income to sustain their everyday needs and college education of her two children. Someday she hopes that her small hog raising business will develop into a big piggery. For now she wants to avail herself of a loan worth PHP 50,000 to buy additional sacks of charcoal, stock of feeds and vitamins for her piglets.\n\nCarmelita dreams that her children will pursue their studies until completion. She prays for good health for the whole family. She meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

With the little time Helena has, she sells crops from their small farm and also keeps dairy cows and poultry. From Kiva lenders, Helena is seeking a loan worth 20,000 KES to grow her horticulture business. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. <br \/><br \/>It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to give Helena access to a loan facility that will aid her to expand her horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increase employment opportunities, and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With your loan, Helena\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business.

From her marriage she bore her son, a 2 year old boy who is her motor and her motivator to reach her goals and objectives. One of them was to generate income for her home. So she went toward her business project and decided that the sale of women's, men's and children's clothes was an excellent opportunity. She was advised by a friend who has a lot of experience in this activity and she invested her savings in her dream of prosperity. Today, she has been doing it for 3 years and she has been able to maintain good results. She has found a lot of opportunities of acquiring clothes wholesale at low prices.

Meet Rose, a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman from the Kericho area of Kenya, near the famous Rift valley. <br \/><br \/>The adversity that has followed her hasn't kept her from wanting to get ahead and reach her goals. She achieves what she sets out to do. <br \/><br \/>Rose has been farming for the past seven years. Through these years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, tea farming and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. <br \/><br \/>Rose is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. Although Rose makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. <br \/><br \/>Kenya's Kericho area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that she could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. <br \/><br \/>Accessing funds has been a challenge for Rose, but she now feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. <br \/><br \/>Rose believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Rose to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children.<br \/><br \/>With your support this woman will be able to make her dreams a reality.

This year, her son began studying at university, but she doesn't have enough money to pay the fees. They have to pay for his first year of study there, but she does not have enough money to pay the full amount straight away. She therefore turned to Arvand, where she found out it was possible to get a loan for education. She hopes very much for a positive outcome, and thanks Arvand in advance for their financial support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":30.8,"image":{"id":1973524,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for education","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-09-19T17:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-19T17:30:11Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muharam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":191.18},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":208.08},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":209.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":208.48},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":220.94},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":229.89},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":227.2},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":241.66},{"due_date":"2016-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":242.97},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":249.66},{"due_date":"2016-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":258.55},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":260.07},{"due_date":"2016-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":275.47},{"due_date":"2016-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":278.38},{"due_date":"2016-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":284.98},{"due_date":"2017-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":295.51},{"due_date":"2017-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":302.02},{"due_date":"2017-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":315.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.52},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.8},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.59},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.6},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.04},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.6},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.93},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.15},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.22},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.9},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.38},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.85},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.91},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.61},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.66},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":30.8,"local_amount":191.18,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:15:00Z","rounded_local_amount":196.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755520213}],"funded_date":"2015-09-19T22:19:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cara Lacey","image":null}},{"id":949253,"name":"Gina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gina  is a married woman with three children.

Meet Esther, a hardworking, dedicated and honest 36-year-old dairy farmer. As the key breadwinner of her family, with a husband and one child, she farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Thika, in the central region of Kenya. For the past five years, she has been practicing mixed farming and her primary source of income has been milk, eggs and crop selling. She also engages in a small business to supplement the meager income she earns through farming. <br \/><br \/>Esther passionately loves dairy farming but the biggest challenge she faces is feeding her cows and satisfying the largely unsatisfied milk market. She is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit and another quality breed of dairy cow. The dairy unit will assist Esther in managing her cows well and also protecting them from the harsh weather conditions. Esther also intends to buy not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 10-20 litres of milk a day. The selling price for milk is 40 Kenya shillings per liter and through this loan she will be making more money. <br \/><br \/>Before Esther joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance that supports smallholder farmers with technical and financial solutions, she considered dairy farming to be a mediocre fallback occupation that did not have a future promise for income generation. After training, Esther now believes that dairy farming is the business to go into if you want a rather less rough way into the \u201cmillionaires club\u201d. With the loan, Esther will increase her income from milk selling and her cows will have more food to eat and never reject food. The key to high yield in milk production is proper feeding of the cows and through this loan, Esther will achieve this. <br \/><br \/>An increase in income will allow Esther to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children. Her dream is to continue improving her dairy breeds and increase milk productivity to achieve better living standards. Esther fears that her dreams might not be realized if Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders cease to provide their reliable market channel, credit facility and services that she requires to grow her dairy enterprise.<br \/><br \/>You can help Esther to be closer to her goals, and a loan will do

She is very industrious and resides in the Chuka area of Kenya. Medoline has been farming for the past five years. Through these years, she has gained much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops, and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Medoline is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plow. <br \/><br \/>Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Chuka area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Medoline could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. <br \/><br \/>Accessing funds has been a challenge for Medoline, but she now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. <br \/><br \/>Medoline believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable a permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Medoline to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":63.05,"image":{"id":1975311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy cereals.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-09-19T19:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-19T19:30:05Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Medoline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2703.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2782.65},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2863.91},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2947.68},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3033.82},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3122.49},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3213.74},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3307.66},{"due_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3404.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3503.82},{"due_date":"2016-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3606.22},{"due_date":"2016-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3711.61},{"due_date":"2016-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3820.08},{"due_date":"2016-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3931.72},{"due_date":"2016-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4046.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.69},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.44},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.21},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.82},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.66},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.53},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.42},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.34},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.29},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.26},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.26},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.29},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.35},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":63.05,"local_amount":6636.89,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":6655.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112537}],"funded_date":"2015-10-19T00:49:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":948491,"name":"Julian","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Don Juli\u00e1n, tiene 63 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casado, tiene 4 hijos y reside en un sector del municipio de Choloma, Cortes junto a su esposo y tres de sus hijos.

Meet Beatrice, one of the most hardworking women on planet earth. She is 43 years of age, very hardworking and a go-getter. She hails from Metkei, a remote village in the Eldoret area of Kenya. This area has harsh weather conditions and to survive, you must have tough skin, but Beatrice has defied all the odds and has been engaged in farming for the past ten years. Her primary sources of income are crops and animal farming. She also gets some income through personal business (sewing business). <br \/><br \/>Beatrice is a person who has had to overcome a lot of adversity in her life. However, she has always had the strength to overcome it and move forward with her four children. She is contented with the farming way of life. Beatrice is a very enterprising woman, and although she never had formal education or formal employment, she has always worked hard on her farm and she has always assured her children and family of a decent meal. <br \/><br \/>The Eldoret area has favorable conditions for horticulture farming, and that is why she is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming. Because of good roads, a good climate, and a good transportation network, she is sure that she will reap maximum profits and be able to increase her business.

Access to a toilet will mean privacy and peace of mind for these families. It will also mean they no longer need to walk long distances, especially when they are sick. Your loan will provide these three families the privacy of using their own toilet, which will be a big step towards a better standard of living for them.
