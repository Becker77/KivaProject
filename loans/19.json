She lives with husband and six-year old son in their own house. They are very close and do everything together. They work hard so as to have more money and improve their standard of living.\r\n\r\nJessica sells groceries in her popular store situated in a busy street. She sells everything, from the smallest to the biggest item, from medicines to sandals, as well as vegetables, toys etc. The store is located in her house and she\u2019s been running it for seven years. All is going well, and Jessica believes this is because she has known for a long time how to run a business. She feels very lucky to have her husband\u2019s support; he drives a taxi and is an important contributor to the household. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning Jessica was very fearful about starting a venture on her own, but need and a desire to overcome difficulties gave her the strength necessary to overcome these problems. Now she is very happy because she doesn\u2019t have to answer to anyone and chooses how to best spend her time. Her short-term goal is to put her business on a sound footing by expanding the store and having more products for her customers. \r\n\r\nThis will be Jessica\u2019s seventh loan with MFP, and she hopes this will be sufficient for her to meet her goals. She promises once again to make her repayments on time as she has done in the past.

Kokir Village in Takeo Province. Mrs. Thoeurn P. is the village bank president who has been selected by the members. She is a farmer who owns 0.5 hectare to cultivate rice on. Her husband, Mr. Tuy Rom, is a construction worker who can make only a small income to support his family. Aside from this activity, he is a breeder who is raising two pigs. <P>\r\n\r\nSince this business is going well, he wants to expand it so his wife decided to ask for a loan to buy more piglets to for breeding in order to improve their living conditions. Mrs. Thoeurn P. is 32 years old and the mother of three children, one of whom is employed in a garment factory while the others are attending the local school. <P>\r\n\r\nAll the members in this village bank have end-of-term loans so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to.

","en":"Gonzalo is a 35 year old man who is married with 2 children, aged 2 and 7.  He lives in the Barrio Fabril zone near Blanco Galindo Avenue at Km. 7 in the Colcapirua Zone of Cercado Province.  This zone is considered agricultural, since it is on the outskirts of Cochabamba City.\r\n\r\nGonzalo drives a taxi along the zone's routes.  His wife works in a school in the community of Pucarita Chica, 3 hours travel from home, requiring 3 changes of buses.  But they have adjusted to the schedule and its requirements and are accustomed to rising very early every day.  Their young children remain in the care of their grandmother while both parents work mornings, but they are very young.  And the youngest has a harelip which was operated on with foreign assistance but he still requires the care and attention of the parents for his recovery since there were complications.  For that reason, Gonzalo's wife had to take a year off from work.  Now that their little one is better and has recuperated, both parents are determined to work hard in order to recover from the child's operation.\r\n\r\nGonzalo requests a loan to buy replacement parts and to carry out general maintenance on his taxi.  He tells us that one of his major dreams is to make enough one day so that his wife can stop working and devote herself 100% to their children. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold

She lives with her husband, Jorge, who is 50 years old, and one of her five sons in their own home.  She posses a large area of land, where she plants coffee and pineapple with the help of her husband, who takes care of the crops on the weekends.  Monday through Friday, she works as a vendor selling jello.  She has been doing this for the past 10 years.  Meanwhile, she works during the day at a popular cafeteria making food in exchange for groceries for her and her family.  Her husband makes about S\/. 30,00 to S\/. 40.00 soles a day, which is more than enough to live comfortably since her children are adults and independent.  What Maria loves most is taking caring of children because they are a great distraction.  In the future, she plans on installing a small convenience store in her home, since she is tired of walking for long hours and working long stretches to care for her cultivations.  This is her fifth credit with MFP and she is very proud to be a part of such a well organized, responsible, and supportive group.  With the loan that she is seeking, she plans to purchase more merchandise, such as household necessities and groceries, in order to expand her store.     \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish

However, Margarita does not have the amount of money needed, which is why she is asking for a loan which she will invest in the purchase of the machine and with this her income will increase and proportionally and significantly improve her quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":906112,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy an overlock sewing machine for sewing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2011-10-28T13:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35642},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36638},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37663},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38716},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39798},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40911},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42054},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43230},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44439},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45681},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46958},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48270}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.72},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.89},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":19.12,"local_amount":34761,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:20:58Z","rounded_local_amount":35751.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244600720},{"amount":19.35,"local_amount":35185,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":36187.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257224033},{"amount":41.88,"local_amount":76142,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:38Z","rounded_local_amount":78312.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075796},{"amount":21.78,"local_amount":39601,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":40729.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902619},{"amount":22.34,"local_amount":40622,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":41779.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432509},{"amount":22.53,"local_amount":40955,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:58:19Z","rounded_local_amount":42122.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378604},{"amount":48.42,"local_amount":88037,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":90546.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617884},{"amount":51.78,"local_amount":94148,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:18:21Z","rounded_local_amount":96831.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165156},{"amount":27.8,"local_amount":50549,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":51989.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347097809}],"funded_date":"2011-10-28T13:48:18Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:45:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":356392,"name":"Lucrencia","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" Nasceu no Distrito da Manhi\u00e7a, Prov\u00edncia de Maputo, Sul de Mo\u00e7ambique, viuva e ma\u00ea de 5  filhos destes  2 ainda frequentam escola.

On average they are paid Rp35,000\/day.  (Translator\u2019s note: 1 US$ fluctuates between Rp9,000-9,500.00). Every day those 3 carpenters could produce about Rp250,000. Not included electricity expense and equipment wear and tear.\r\nHis products results are quite good, clean and guaranteed quality, since all carpenters work in their expertise, so that his customers increase.\r\nDinari gave Rp10,000,000 additional loan for Uma Wardana, that was used to buy furniture making machinery and other raw materials.

She is a single mother and lives at home with her parents and her little 4-year-old son Carlos.  She wishes to give him a good life and offer him a good education.  Tatiana can be found at the Santa B\u00e1rbara market (an important market in Juliaca).  She has a phone center where she also sells her artificial flowers.  She sells roses, carnations, violets, etc. in a small corner.  They are very pretty flowers and priced reasonably.  She enjoys talking with the other sellers and doesn\u2019t miss an opportunity to sell them a flower to decorate their stalls.  She suffers a lot in order to get the flowers since she brings them from Bolivia.  Tatiana has been in this business for 4 years and it is going very well for her.  She still doesn\u2019t feel fulfilled since she would like to open a bigger store just to sell artificial flowers in order to pay for her dear son\u2019s education.  This is Tatiana\u2019s first loan with MFP.  She knows she has to meet her payments and she hopes to be able to do that.

T. (7) is a 74-year-old female living in the town of Thanh Hoa. She is the group leader of a six-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.

The official name of this borrowing group is 05-Dong Hai (016-06-05 Dong Hai).\r\n\r\nMui is widowed and has five adult-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store, selling confectionery products in the local community.

Mui has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,248,000 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 5,787,900 VND which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This will be her 8th loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. Mui plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  D.

What she likes best about her job is advising her clients about which products are appropriate for their specific skin type.\r\n\r\nLia has been in this business for three years and finds that the most challenging aspect of her work is having to knock on doors all day in search of clients. She will use the current loan of 3000 soles to purchase more beauty care products in the city of Lima so that she could offer her customers a wider range of options. With time, Lia hopes to put up her own cosmetics store where she could sell her products in a more comfortable setting.

Patrick is a hardworking, ambitious and go-getter farmer who is 36 years of age. He hails from Gitugi, a small village in the Thika area of Kenya. He comes from a very humble background, and did not manage to attend college, but that did not kill his spirit to succeed. \r\n\r\nHe has actively been involved in farming for the past eight years. Although he has made great strides in farming, he wants to diversify his farming, and is kindly seeking a loan to buy goats. \r\n\r\nGoat farming is one of the profitable agricultural ventures in Kenya, and Patrick, having an entrepreneur's mind, wants to take advantage of that to improve his living conditions. Patrick loves goat farming because goats are not demanding to keep, unlike poultry, which require special care and attention. \r\n\r\nPatrick believes that with the loan his life will permanently change because he will be selling goat meat and dairy goat milk to the ready market that is available. As far as the market of goat products is concerned, demand is greater than supply. Patrick always says to become a successful goat farmer you need three ingredients, and that is getting the right breed, giving the right feed, and proper care.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, he believes he will become a successful goat farmer and be able to realize his dream of transforming his life. Having been farming for the past 10 years, Patrick finds it very enjoyable to raise goats because he does not spend more money on buying food. Patrick will also sell manure from the goats and use it on his farm, also saving much more money and improving his living conditions. \r\n\r\nProfits from selling goat meat to the local market and goat milk will be used to fully repay the loan."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1863624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy goats","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Thika","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":707.73},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":728.41},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":749.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":771.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":794.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":817.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":841.26},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":865.84},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":891.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":917.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":944},{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":971.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.52},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.82},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.14},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.8},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":980035,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is 30 years old.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":303360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cosmetics in bulk for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-17T17:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enjo M.

","en":"Born in 1963, Gulsunoi A. is married and has 3 children.  She retired several years ago, but because she could not just stay at home, Gulsunoi decided to get involved in business.  Her son is a butcher, whose job is to send livestock to a slaughterhouse.  Gulsunoi sold beef and lamb tallow and, thus, started her business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a dairy farmer and sells the milk to an enterprise that produces all kinds of dairy products.  Her husband, asiD. from helping with the milk production, also farms and produces most of the feed, like chala (corn husks and cobs), alfalfa and corn, needed for the dairy cows.  Eustaquia lives in the Machac Marca area of Cochabamba.  This is an area that is quite far from the city so for them to go to banks in search of financing is very difficult.  This is why Cidre took the initiative to go to this area and we discovered that the conditions in which they have their cattle are not very good; most lack stable facilities which in this rainy season is very much needed.  Therefore, Eustaquia will use these funds to build a stable so that her cows won't suffer during the rainy season.  Eustaquia tells us that her greatest wish is to continue with milk production like she's done to date, to see her children and grandchildren have a better future, and to someday have enough cattle to leave her children an inheritance that will help them in life, which every day is more difficult in the nation.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

For 4 years she has been selling animals in the main livestock fairs, mostly in the weekends when she makes more sales. As well she earns other additional income on behalf of her neighbours who ask her to sell an animal.  Alongside this activity, Giachina also spends time selling food in the afternoons, and more when it is the community's celebration season and she sells tourists her vegetable soups. So it is in this way that she arranges her time to focus on her livestock and her food sales without also forgetting her home. What she likes best about her work is to continually receive income and this helps her in running her household. In the future she has plans to buy land where she can put her animals for sale, at present she houses her livestock in her mother's barn.

In order to get to the community, there is a detour off the highway over 8 km. of rough dirt track, barely usable during the rainy season, before arriving at the main town.  She is 29, married with 3 children of 8, 4, and 7 months.  For the last 3 years she has been selling fresh cheeses that she makes herself with milk that she buys from small dairies in the area.  She also has had a grocery shop for a short while, and she would like to enlarge her business.  Although she is married, her husband gives her very little towards expenses since he works at subsistence-level agriculture.  Therefore she needs to sell more to generate more income to improve the economic situation of her family.  Among other necessities is the purchase of a cheese press in order to diversify her products to sell pressed cheeses, since currently she only sells fresh cheese.  If she continues to qualify for more credit, she will be able to buy this machine with the next loan.  Before requesting a loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, she was working through a savings bank, but because of bad service she decided to change to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  For this she had to form a group of 12 persons, each with their own economic activity.  The names of the members of the group and their business are below: \r\n\r\n<b>Name,                                Loan Amount,\t     Business<\/b>\r\nAreli R.

She buys smoked fish on order in Mopti, from her parents, for resale at the big market on fair days. On regular workdays, she sells the smoked fish at the local market where she is in high demand by her customers (consisting mostly of housewives and condiment vendors) for the quality of her product.\r\n\r\nIn order to better serve a steadily increasing customer base, she decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso micro-finance institution where she received a first loan that was repaid without incident.\r\n\r\nShe is seeking a second loan to expand her business. She plans to buy 15 cartons of smoked fish of varying grades.\r\n\r\nShe expects to achieve a monthly profit of 125,000 FCFA to be used primarily to increase her working capital, help with the family expenses, and pay the interest on the loan.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Nathalie Pelletier, Kiva

Her previous loan of 20,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $338, raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th cycle loan, she is borrowing 28,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy fertilizers for her vegetable farm so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs and the education of her children. Elma P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

The group is composed of 12 people, all women. The woman who leads this group is Antonia Florencia L\u00f3pez Mart\u00ednez.  All of the women have different activities with which they support their families.\r\n\r\nWe will tell the story of one member of the group, named Rosa Elia Jim\u00e9nez C.. 31 years old, she is a single mother and has a 4-year-old son named Jared who is in kindergarten.  Rosa Elia dedicates herself to the sale of candy as a street vendor in different parts of the city, such as the central park, outside of public schools and at various intersections.  Rosa did not have formal schooling after having completed 4th grade, she comes from a humble family and lives in a small house made of laminated cardboard, wood, and concrete.  She has 4 sisters and her father is engaged in making and selling flavored ice, while her mother of 60 years also sells sweets.\r\n\r\nOne of the most difficult situations facing Rosa is the total loss of her inventory: she tells us a few days ago her house was robbed and they took all of her merchandise that she and her family worked so hard for, as well as some of their other investments, leaving them totally ruined.  She described her desperate situation with tears of sadness and frustration that she could not hide.\r\n\r\nRosa Elia joined a credit group out of the extreme necessity to restart her business from scratch after her life savings were stolen in a few minutes.  She will use the loan to purchase the products that she has traditionally sold: hard candy in different flavors, popsicles, caramels, candy made from cajeta syrup, chewing gum, cornmeal fritters, tamarind pulp and candies, mints, peanut brittle, roasted peanuts, popcorn, chile sauce for jicama, and jellies.\r\n\r\nRosa has great hope that she will bounce back very soon and that she will also be able to recuperate her family losses.  She wants to have a dignified house and not to have her business go through that again.  She dreams of seeing her son succeed one day and become a good person who works at a good job.  She would like to give him more schooling in the future and grow the business, or even create another one.  The most important thing for her family going forward is that they do not have gaps in income as today, and that her parents will be able to retire without having to work in the streets.\r\n\r\nThe members of the \u201c\u00c1lvaro Carrillo\u201d group are simple women, whose only desire is to improve their quality of life; they believe in their dreams, in the vision of a better world where there is not so much poverty and insecurity.\r\n\r\nRosa Elia, crying in happiness and sadness at the same time, smiles at us without hiding her pain.  Her smile is the best form gratitude we can provide, thank you to Fundacion Realidad and to those who support Kiva for being so generous.\r\n\r\nThese are the names of the woman who make up the \u201c\u00c1lvaro Carrillo\u201d group and each of their businesses:\r\n\r\nFeliza Antonia Miguel \u2013 Cheese sales\r\nAntonia Florencia L\u00f3pez Mart\u00ednez \u2013 Perfume sales\r\nEpifania S.

His first loan was used to improve his home, since it is difficult to put together enough money to buy foundation slabs. With the loan, he agrees that each month, after the payment, he has to pay the installment that is already established. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":259597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To build a bathroom and sanitary services","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Chontales","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.083333 -85.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agustin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":636.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.82},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.82},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.82},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.82},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.82},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.82},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.82},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.82},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.82},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.82},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.82,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:22:07Z","rounded_local_amount":641.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351593},{"amount":31.82,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:08:10Z","rounded_local_amount":641.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038931},{"amount":31.81,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":641.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35929226},{"amount":31.82,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:22:27Z","rounded_local_amount":641.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44384137},{"amount":31.82,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":641.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890599},{"amount":31.83,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":641.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111898},{"amount":31.82,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:44:35Z","rounded_local_amount":641.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533310},{"amount":31.82,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:52:03Z","rounded_local_amount":641.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86964687},{"amount":95.44,"local_amount":1909.12,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:49:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1923.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875154}],"funded_date":"2009-02-07T23:01:16Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T10:49:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":89220,"name":"Rosaura","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nRosaura comenz\u00f3 a trabajar en una tienda propia, estuvo muchos a\u00f1os pero no fue si no hasta que cay\u00f3 enferma que lo abandono.

","en":"Rahbaroy O. is a 35-year-old married woman, who has three children.  She works as a nurse in the Palassa hospital.  However, her salary is very low, and this is why Rahbaroy and her husband are involved in livestock feeding and sales.  She also has a large plot of land at home where she planted cucumbers and tomatoes.  Rahbaroy plans to can the vegetables from her garden.  Rahbaroy\u2019s father is a long-time client of ours.  He obtains financing for his animal husbandry business.  He is also the one who advised his daughter to increase her livestock headcount while livestock market prices are low.  Rahbaroy now owns three cows, one of which is pictured here.  This is why Rahbaroy requested this loan.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":312187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To increase livestock headcount","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Kairakkum","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-05-09T23:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rahbaroy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":216.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":229.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44600105},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-30T07:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":229.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994521},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:07:41Z","rounded_local_amount":229.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215770},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":229.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645258},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:27:16Z","rounded_local_amount":229.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87084839},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":216.65,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:36:18Z","rounded_local_amount":229.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97001032}],"funded_date":"2009-05-10T02:52:37Z","paid_date":"2009-12-04T09:36:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":109700,"name":"Abel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abel is 28 years old and is single without a child.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  a general store, a tricycle transport business, and dried fish selling. \r\n\r\nAngela joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Angela has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 29,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $237, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing 29,500 PHP, with which she intends to buy inventory for the general store and dried fish to sell so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs. Angela D. P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She believes she is nowhere near the limit for her business and is planning to open a unique flower storehouse unlike any other in the city.  \r\n\r\nNataliya is requesting a loan for $1,200 to purchase some equipment she will need for her flower storehouse. She\u2019d like to buy a self-contained floral refrigeration system and condensate evaporators that will help keep her plants fresh and fragrant. Nataliya would also like to buy a variety of spring flowers such as daisies, tulips, carnations, daffodils and roses for further retail sale. Being a plant-lover, Nataliya knows that an assortment of flowers will brighten up many people\u2019s hearts after the long, gray winter.

After a while, she started getting more and more customers as she used her loan to add more products. She has a lot of students as customers.

Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and then either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiple naturally!

This is 56 year old Avelina G. from Mwanza. She is married with four children, between the ages of 24 and 34 years old. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependant because her parents do not take care of her. Avelina has been running a poultry or \"Kuku\" business since 2008. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. Avelina works at the business for 4 hours per day, 7 days per week and currently earns about 120USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400USD in order to purchase chickens and raise them. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Avelina thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303401,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase chickens and raise them","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Avelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613692},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010771},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233057},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664848},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:46Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105560},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022682},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:47Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867928},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757129},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146241},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984403}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T11:44:33Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Waring","image":null}},{"id":105620,"name":"Juanita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Juanita M. is 53 years old and married with 6 children.

Paulina trabaja con la instituci\u00f3n desde hace bastante tiempo atr\u00e1s, m\u00e1s espec\u00edficamente desde el a\u00f1o 2004 y ahora est\u00e1 en su quinto cr\u00e9dito el cual lo cancela sin contratiempos. Tambi\u00e9n tiene un cr\u00e9dito en otra instituci\u00f3n bancaria el cual esta cancelando de manera puntual. \n\n","en":"\r\nPaulina, 58, has recently become a widow due to her husband\u2019s death by heart attack.  She doesn\u2019t have any little children depending of her any longer but the only child she still has lives with her in her own home.\r\n\r\nPaulina has had a small grocery store in her home for several years offering her products to her neighborhood.  She doesn\u2019t have any nearby competition so her sales are good because she stocks buying at wholesale from the most important and busiest markets in the city.\r\n\r\nShe will use the funds to stock her store because her husband\u2019s illness caused her to neglect her business a bit and it\u2019s somewhat destabilized.\r\n\r\nPaulina has collaborated with the institution for quite some time now, specifically since 2004.  This is her 5th loan which she will repay without any difficulty.  She has an additional loan with another financial institution which she is also repaying punctually.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

The group consists of four members who know each other and are neighbors.\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the group members is Violeta A. A..  She is 40 years old and completed her studies through the third year of secondary school.  She has two children, a son and a daughter, both of whom are students:  David Alexis (age 15) and Diana Karen (age 11).  Violeta operates a butcher shop and will use her loan to buy live pigs so that she can sell the meat and other derivatives by the kilo.  The products that she offers include meat, steaks, pork rinds, meat enchiladas, longaniza sausage, lard, and pork wraps.  She started her business four years ago because she needed to earn more money for her family.  Violeta received assistance from her brother-in-law, who taught her everything she needed to know about running the business.  When her brother-in-law found it necessary to move away, she decided to take over the business and continue its operation.  Violeta\u2019s husband helps with killing and butchering the pigs.  Her son is responsible for removing the fat from the hides and cleaning the floor.  She plans to reinvest some of her profits in the purchase of an electric meat grinder because she currently has a manual one.  In addition, she would like to buy a computer for her children.\r\n<p>\r\nVioleta\u2019s business is located in her house in Tepalcingo.  She likes her community because the people are very friendly.  A fair is held every third Friday for Lent, so she is able to see people who come from different places to visit the church.\r\n<p>\r\nThe members of the group are as follows:\r\n\u2022\tSra.

Beginning very early in the morning every day, she travels the streets looking for customers.  In addition to selling shoes, she also makes them.  She is very good at her work, so she also sells her shoes to other vendors.  The thing she likes best about her work is making the shoes, and she puts a lot of effort into it.  She has done this work for three years.  She thinks the most difficult thing about her work is transporting the shoes to where they are sold, because she has to visit many different areas.  She hopes that in the future she will have a large store where she can sell all the shoes she makes.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP, and she has paid all of her past loans on time, and she plans to pay this loan on time also.  Her community bank is very active.  With the 2000 nuevos soles she has requested, she will purchase new materials to make a larger quantity of shoes. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":751945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase materials to make shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-21T01:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":90.63,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:57Z","rounded_local_amount":255.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270224},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":255.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550243},{"amount":90.63,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":255.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718918},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":255.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350386},{"amount":90.63,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":255.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850884},{"amount":91.71,"local_amount":252.99,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:22Z","rounded_local_amount":258.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666005},{"amount":106.82,"local_amount":294.68,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":301.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621188},{"amount":73.34,"local_amount":202.33,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":206.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835348}],"funded_date":"2011-04-21T03:47:17Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eileen Lloyd","image":721623}},{"id":294951,"name":"Flor Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Flor tiene 44  a\u00f1os de edad, es casada y tiene 2 hijos.
