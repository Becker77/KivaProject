It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to provide poor and low income clients with the assistance they need to develop a viable business. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Jesus is 42 and lives in his own home with his wife Francisca (38) and 2 young children. For twenty years he has cultivated peas and potatoes with his wife's help. She brings him lunch in the fields and stays to help until the evening. \r\n\r\nHis favorite part of all of this is watching these native goods planted on his own land grow and ripen. He dislikes that wholesalers try to pay low prices at harvest time despite the quality of his goods. For that reason, in the past few years he has taken his goods to the capital. He has regular customers there that buy his products at good prices and allow him to make a bit more money.\r\n\r\nHe feels this is a profitable activity since it provides his family a better quality of life. He would like to have shop in the city for his wife to manage and leave the hard work in the fields. This is his tenth loan with MFP, and is very happy to continue his work with the members of the community group, who have shown themselves to be responsible in repaying their loans. \r\n\r\nJesus plans to invest his loan buying pea seeds and a few sacks of fertilizer to help grow potatoes. He has a unique variety of quality potato seeds and hopes to keep growing through them. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Solson Scherman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":568184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase pea seeds and fertilizer to increase his production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":900,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2541.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886544}],"funded_date":"2010-08-03T01:09:19Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":218707,"name":"Jaqueline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jaqueline was born in 1970.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The money that she earns has permitted to help her mother with the cultivations whenever she has needed the support, in addition, she loves agriculture, especially cofee because she considers it a very profitable product (especially on holidays). Milgros will start her own plantation in her mother's field because she would like to become a prosperous agriculturer. She will also continue with her work at the hotel to be able to offer her clients the coffee beans from her plantation, without needing a distributor.

Since that time, the ten members have received loans that have helped to improve their businesses, with the goal of improving their quality of life. \r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s treasurer, Grace R. A., decided four years ago to start selling groceries from her home. She did this with money that her husband gave her. She saved it up to buy two sacks of rice, 1 sack of sugar, 1 case of cooking oil, 1 case of canned food, and 1 package of noodles to start a grocery store. She has had some ups and downs with this business, but Grace\u2019s administrative skills caused her business to grow. Because of this she was able to improve her house, finish educating her children in school, and get her oldest son started in a technical degree program. Grace and her husband decided to invest in a vehicle that they rent out so that they can continue to generate additional income. They were able to do this with loans that they obtained from EDAPROSPO \u2013 PROSPERIDAD plus her husband\u2019s income as a driver and the income from the store. Her goal is to continue educating her youngest child, who is four years old. She also wants to build a future for her old age, since she doesn\u2019t have a pension. She needs the loan to continue running and improving her store.\r\n\r\nArsenia R. C. D. Orozco is 58 years old and the mother of eight children, 3 of whom are still dependant on her. Her husband\u2019s income as a locksmith wasn\u2019t enough, so she decided to sell cookies, sweets, soft drinks, and sandwiches from a rented kiosk, with the goal of covering expenses for her large family. She also prepared tamales at home on the weekends, which also provided her with some small income. She quit selling for a while due to an illness of her youngest son, who has Down syndrome. She is now selling again but now she sells beer, which has been profitable so far. She wants to invest part of her loan in buying more beer and she\u2019ll use the remainder to buy a display case and glasses, because she wants to eventually open the kiosk again and continue supporting her family.\r\n\r\nLibia Orozco R. is a street vendor of fruits, soft drinks, fruit drinks, and sandwiches that she prepares at home.

Cesar is 18, Diego is 13, Valery is 8, and Luz Adriana is 3.\r\n\r\nPercy is a bricklayer.  With much anguish he tells us that as the years pass the children grow and need more things.  But, his salary as a bricklayer is insufficient.  Therefore, Percy had to work at another business.  He saw the opportunity to start selling handicrafts.\r\n\r\nPercy tells us that in the beginning it was difficult to open a small store selling handicrafts.  He did not know much about the subject, and there was a lot of competition.  In spite of the adversities, he was able to fulfill his dream of having his own store.  \r\n\r\nHe now has a stand in the Intipakari commercial center, which is located on the main avenue in the city of Cusco.  Percy saw that the business was profitable, so he decided to open a small shop for making handicrafts.  That way he is his own provider.\r\n\r\nHe is a hard-working and responsible man.  He did not hesitate for a minute to become part of the Sacsayhuaman Communal Bank.  He has worked with Arariwa for several cycles.  The loan is to buy sweaters, shawls, gloves, and \"chullos\" (Peruvian knit hats with ear flaps).\r\n\r\nHe is grateful for the opportunity of the loan, and he promises to makes his payments on time.\r\n\r\n    \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":508761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buy sweaters, shawls, gloves, and \"chullos\" (Peruvian knit hats with ear flaps)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-03-18T18:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Percy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":470.97},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":489.81},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":509.41},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":529.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.73},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.66},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":348.65,"local_amount":961.8,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":982.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633558},{"amount":376.35,"local_amount":1038.2,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1060.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151851635}],"funded_date":"2010-03-19T00:34:51Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":190046,"name":"Elsie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elsie P. is from the village of Kinoguitan, Misamis Oriental.

It is on the hilly outskirts of the city and has dirt roads. He has a stand in the Fort\u00edn market where he sells chickens.\r\n\r\nHe started this business 15 years ago in a rural town called Balzar. He would buy chickens and slaughter and pluck them before selling them around town.  However, he decided that he wanted to earn more profits, so he moved to Guayaquil and began his business in the market. Little by little through his hard work he was able to buy his own stand and now he sells chicken by the pound. He wakes up at 5:00 a.m. to prepare the chickens.\r\n\r\nWith the loan he will purchase drawers for his stand, chickens, and a freezer. In the future he hopes to have his own store and make improvements on his house. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patrick King, Kiva

T. is a married woman who lives in Malocbaloc, Brgy. Agujo, Daanbantayan, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: Food Vending and buying and selling firewood. Her husband Marcelo, who is 33 years old, works as a fisherman\/trisikad driver to earn his living.  They have 3 children who are currently going to school and are between 5 to 9 years old. \r\n\r\nRosalie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past two loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosalie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,600, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 3rd loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 which she intends to use as additional funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for future home improvements. \r\n\r\n Rosalie D. T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

A group of housewives in Karangsari village (West Bali) used the island\u2019s name as its group name. Menjangan group is a group of village housewives who meet every week in the village hall for money saving and loaning activities or conduct cleaning activities in the neighborhood. This group is lead by Ni Nengah Suarniti with Ni Ketut Suwitri as the secretary and Ni Luh Warni as the treasurer. This group has 15 members. Besides the money saving and loaning activity, this group also runs pig farming business at their own houses. This business was not coordinated well so that they had not earned maximum profit. The livestock had not been treated and fed well due to lack of knowledge in pig farming. After getting consultations and counseling about group management and good ways of pig farming from Dinari, Menjangan group plans to raise high quality piglets and to buy good quality pig\u2019s food so that they can produce pigs with quality that meets the market\u2019s standard. Each person needs a fund of Rp. 1,400,000 (about $148) which will be used to buy 4 piglets that cost Rp. 250,000 (about $26) each and Rp. 400,000 (about $42) for the food expense. After raising the pigs for 5 months, the Menjangan group will sell the pigs at the same time. The marketing will be coordinated by Dinari so that the group will have good selling price and on-time payment. With better group management and knowledge, they feel quite optimistic that the business will go well and they can still run the money saving and loaning activities since the part of the profit is kept in the group savings.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kustini Lim, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u201d Pulau Menjangan\u201d adalah sebuah pulau di Bali barat yang merupakan kawasan wisata untuk diving dan snorkle.

In her town, everyone works in agriculture. She wanted to sell clothing, but her circumstances have changed, now that she has children and a husband who's a farmer. He plants potatoes and other produce, but she didn't want to plant potatoes because it requires such a large investment and the market price is not satisfactory. But this season, at least, the price of fertilizers has fallen from 215 to 185 soles, and she hopes the price will hold steady so she can recoup her investment. The family has faced difficulties planting their fields because they didn't have enough money to fertilize both of them, so one is not as productive as they'd hoped. This is Bacilia's seventh loan from Microfinanzas Prisma, and she tells us with sincerity that she has only delayed in making one payment, but after various loans the microfinance institution has regained its confidence in her, and she has not let them down. Now she will buy fertilizer that will enable her to fertilize the potato field, with the hope that May will bring a satisfactory harvest.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":236653,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizer for crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-13T04:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bacilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":975,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3014.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210677}],"funded_date":"2008-12-13T18:21:08Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Trisha Bury","image":804995}},{"id":82691,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth O. is 35 years old and is married with 6 children.

Her future plans are to purchase other fields, so that they can plant in rotation and double their profit, for herself to no longer need to work in the hotel. Rufina is joining a solidarity group, and is very happy to work with the other members, and likewise commits to pay punctually each of the installments scheduled by her credit adviser. The money that she is requesting is to purchase fertilizers for her husband's crops.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Heather Nicholson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":306950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-23T17:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rufina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.71,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":141.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012501},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:33Z","rounded_local_amount":141.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596098},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":141.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990365},{"amount":45.73,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":141.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211487},{"amount":92.12,"local_amount":268,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:31Z","rounded_local_amount":284.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640993}],"funded_date":"2009-04-23T20:16:15Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Heather Nicholson","image":null}},{"id":107267,"name":"Margaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret B. is fifty-four years old.

Marhabo has a business selling women\u2019s underclothes and dressing gowns. She has a good, busy location for her business with many people passing by, but she is concerned with the cost of rent and may move to another location. Marhabo has been in business for three years. Her husband has been struggling with illness, which is a real concern for Marhabo. She does her best to help him, and would like to see him recover completely. Marhabo has requested a loan of 3000 TJS to help her purchase more inventory. Periodically, she has the opportunity to attend trade shows and display her products. She\u2019d like to have some additional inventory to take with her to the shows so that she can work on improving her sales and increasing her income. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He lives in the Laureles Norte neighborhood. His business is selling tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, and other products. He has been in this business for twelve years. The difficulty that he has is when perishable products are scarce and the price goes up, sales are low and he can suffer product loss. The loans he has obtained from Afodenic have strengthened and expanded his sales of vegetables. With this loan he will buy a large quantity of tomatoes and bell peppers to increase his sales and improve his income. He has a pick-up truck that he uses to buy his products, and he also uses it for transport for extra income.

La experiencia de los miembros del grupo es escasa pero son gente responsable y con ganas de trabajar para sacar adelante a sus familias."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2025,"image":{"id":405836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Capital de Operaciones","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:34Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2025,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tatiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ninfa Dalcy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jerlin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nahir","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Iris Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dalcy Lili","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sussy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sirley Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"America","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1329.02},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1344.32},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1359.79},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1375.43},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1391.26},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1407.27},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1423.46},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1439.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.41},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1473.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":196.68},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198.95},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":201.24},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":203.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205.89},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.26},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":583.36,"local_amount":4033.13,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:26:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4066.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103788534},{"amount":198.95,"local_amount":1375.43,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:28:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1386.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103788535},{"amount":201.24,"local_amount":1391.26,"processed_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:06:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1402.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678658},{"amount":203.55,"local_amount":1407.27,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:09:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1418.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678659},{"amount":205.89,"local_amount":1423.46,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1435.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678660},{"amount":208.26,"local_amount":1439.84,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:27:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1451.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073141},{"amount":210.66,"local_amount":1456.41,"processed_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1468.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073142},{"amount":213.09,"local_amount":1473.2,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1485.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909068}],"funded_date":"2009-11-16T00:37:25Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":148343,"name":"Betty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Betty F. is from the village of Mialem.

Tatiana has her own home with a small dining room where she attends to her customers. She requires a loan to expand her business and to be able to buy tables, improving her earnings in this way and giving a better quality of life to her 3 children, who are her reason for moving forward. Her husband works for a softdrink delivery company and in his spare time he helps his wife with her restaurant. The rest of the members have their own businesses, some in their homes and some in the market, including empanada and drink sales, grocery sales, and some also work as employees (but they are the promoters). In reality competention exists everywhere but as a group they always try to support each other, especially in cosmetic sales, as they sell them door to door. The loan destined for these members is so they can stock their shops and buy more products and offer better services to their customers, so that their businesses have a future with better earnings and they have an improved economic situation. As it is a new group the bank has given them the capacity to be satisfied and content to be Agrocapital clients, but some of the members already possess experience thanks to similar loans from other

children: one is a laborer, one is a farmer and one is a rice seller, while the other three are attending the local school.

general store, selling a variety of products in the local community. She has many years of experience in this business.\r\n\r\nFiatagata needs a loan of WST $2,000 to purchase additional products to sell. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 320 WST or US $133 per week) to financially support the immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Fiatagata joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Fiatagata's third loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 1 to 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the overall social metric score. For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

izquierda de la fotograf\u00eda) de 18 a\u00f1os de edad, quien est\u00e1 cursando su tercer a\u00f1o de la carrera de odontolog\u00eda, ellos son originarios de la ciudad de Boaco, ciudad con muchas carencias y poco desarrollo social, sobre todo en el tema de salud.\n\nDesde peque\u00f1a y a lo largo de sus estudios secundarios Alexandra aprendi\u00f3 a conocer y detectar los problemas que m\u00e1s aquejan a la comunidad donde ha crecido especialmente los problemas de salud bucal en los ni\u00f1os y adolescentes por el bajo nivel de ingresos de las familias. Considera que con su formaci\u00f3n profesional puede intervenir en esa situaci\u00f3n trabajando en equipo, siendo una persona disciplinada y con empat\u00eda para ayudar las personas m\u00e1s necesitadas.\n\nAlexandra, tiene una beca completa por excelencia acad\u00e9mica en la universidad donde estudia su carrera de Odontolog\u00eda  gan\u00e1ndose la misma despu\u00e9s de competir a nivel nacional con m\u00e1s de trescientos estudiantes del pa\u00eds y tiene como meta  graduarse con honores. Otra de sus metas es ser una profesional exitosa en su campo laboral a partir de la creaci\u00f3n de su propia cl\u00ednica social donde podr\u00e1 ayudar a mejorar la salud bucal de las personas que no pueden pagar un tratamiento en cl\u00ednicas privadas y buscar alianzas para financiar proyectos como campa\u00f1as de salud bucal que tengan un impacto positivo en ni\u00f1os y adolescentes especializ\u00e1ndose en odontopediatr\u00eda atendiendo las zonas rurales de Boaco, a la vez usar esos conocimientos para contribuir al desarrollo de iniciativas sociales en conjunto con Operaci\u00f3n Sonrisa y otros proyectos cuyo objetivo principal sea mejorar la salud de ni\u00f1os y adolescentes de escasos recursos.\n\nAlexandra considera que los profesionales de hoy deben pensar en el bienestar del pr\u00f3jimo antes que en el bienestar propio y que \u00e9stos est\u00e9n en igualdad de condiciones para desarrollarse y tener una vida plena, adem\u00e1s que muchos de los problemas de nuestro pa\u00eds pueden ser superados con soluciones creativas, innovadoras y que fomenten el esp\u00edritu emprendedor que existe en cada una de las personas.\n\nPara don Alejandro, su hija es su mayor orgullo y la raz\u00f3n por la cual cualquier sacrificio es peque\u00f1o para lograr los objetivos, el \u00e9xito y concretizar los sue\u00f1os que ella se ha propuesto, por lo que el cr\u00e9dito solicitado es para la compra de materiales odontol\u00f3gicos de su hija y que ella pueda realizar sus pr\u00e1cticas ya que esto no lo cubre la beca que ella tiene en la

She has two children that are students and a husband who works as an electrician. Lesbia has been running a restaurant for five years that her mother left to her. She has been able to keep it going thanks to the loans that Afodenic has given her, not only to help her business but also to help her build a house, which she feels very satisfied with. With this loan, which is her eighth, she is going to invest in construction materials like beams and corrugated iron in order to put up the roof as well as doors to be able to get into her house.  In the future she would like to make improvements to her business in order to be able to give good service to her customers. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Shimmin, Kiva

The loan he\u2019ll obtain next will be used to buy 20 liters of lamp oil to resell with the aim of increasing his profits.\r\nAs he wants to develop and diversify his business, he decided to join one of Hope\u2019s groups in August 2009. He makes a profit of about $150 per month. Ren\u00e9 has succeeded with good strategies to build permanent customers.

She is 55 years old. Nienes is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Nienes owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Nienes has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 11,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nienes joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nienes has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Nienes is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Nienes from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support education of children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

This will be her 17th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 16,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step on her journey toward economic freedom. Virgina hopes to improve her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the <i>Dungganon<\/i> way. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

He is married with three children. Badriddin has been a farmer for the last 15 years. Farming is a passion for him. He practices both dairy farming and mixed crop farming. Badriddin says he has chosen farming as a career because the produce reaped from his farm has a ready market. His challenge at the moment is that he is not fully utilizing all his land.  This is because he used up all his proceeds form the last harvest to pay his children's school fees and was not able to buy the seeds and fertilizers needed to plant all of his land. Badriddin is requesting a loan of 10 000 Somoni to be able to purchase the resources needed for the next planting season. He will purchase assorted seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants.   \r\n  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Nader is a conservative man, so his father was photographed in his place.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:<p>\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. <p>\r\n\r\nFor more information on lending in the Muslim

is married with four children and her family lives in a five room house in the city of Bamenda in northwest Cameroon. She has faced challenges in life which includes the death of family members, and the theft of her last loan.\r\n\r\nSusana joined GHAPE in the year 2000 and has taken and repaid loans eleven times. Her previous loans were used for farming and to build a motorbike transportation business.  The profits from these businesses were used to buy medication for her family and to pay for her children's education.\r\n\r\nSusana plans to use this loan to buy a new motorbike for her transportation business and strongly believes the business will succeed because she has competent drivers and she has also made progress in improving her profit margins. The community will benefit from her transportation service, especially as the roads are poor and motorbikes are better able to serve the area. Her bikes will  also be used to transport  produce to and from nearby markets and  farms.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":957407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

She buys the <i>omena<\/i>, as the fish are called, from her aunt and sells them in the market in Kitale, Kenya, on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Having only been in business for a year, Pamela is already making a good profit.  From each 10,000 shilling barrel of fish that she buys, she can earn between 4,000 and 5,000 shillings in profit.  Her biggest expenses are her transportation costs going to and from Kitale by bus from Kisumu.  With the proceeds from her business, Pamela has already built a home and is renting out a part of it for additional income.  Her dream for her business is to someday buy a pick-up truck so that she can carry her goods to the market by herself, but for now she is happy to take out a loan to increase her volume of fish to sell.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn addition to running her business, she volunteers as a community health worker and teaches children in a nursery.

Aminata dropped out of school in the 9th grade (Basic Malian educational system) to get married by parental will. She started her business after the death of her husband. She began by selling cakes; this business has given her the chance to gain business and marketing expertise. Later she started selling garlic and shallots and she has been now for 17 years in this business. She is well known in the area and enjoys a good reputation. In order to increase her capital and her revenue, 36 months ago she has joined Soro Yiriwaso and she received 2 group loans and 2 individual loans, all fully repaid. She is now receving her third individual loan, that she intends to use to buy a ton of shallots. She buys and sells in Burkina Faso in cash, wholesale and credit to a clientele of men and women. With this loan she plans to earn a monthly income of 120,000 CFA francs, that she will use for the family needs (buy food, clothing for children and payment of tuition fees). \r\nHer ambition is to

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<p>\r\nVeronica runs a general store from which she sells both food and daily use products to the local community. Veronica has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2010, Veronica joined ASKI to gain access to its financial services.

She sells firewood which she goes out to the countryside to find together with her son.  They make bundles and sell them in the town.  Maria also raises pigs in a small pen located behind her home.  She tells us that she started out with one pig and, with the profits she made from selling it, she bought two more.  Maria needs this loan to invest in buying pigs and feed.\r\n\r\nMary tells us that she hopes, in the future, to build a pen from blocks, iron rods and cement, and to buy more pigs so that she can continue raising animals.  Mary's house is made from wood and palm leaves.  In the future, she would like to re-build it from more solid material in order to improve her home so that she doesn't get cold any more during the winter months.  Mary is grateful for the trust that our foundation has placed in her by granting her this loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":699715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy firewood and pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"VISTA HERMOSA, VERACRUZ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-24T19:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":225.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":227.76},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":230.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":232.71},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":235.22},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":237.76},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":240.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":242.92},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":245.54},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":248.19},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250.87},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":253.57},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":256.31},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":259.07},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":261.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":264.69},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":267.55},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":270.43},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":273.35},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":276.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.15},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.36},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.57},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.78},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.21},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.42},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.65},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.1},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.32},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.56},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.78},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.02},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.26},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.74},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.99},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.24},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.51,"local_amount":453.1,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:52Z","rounded_local_amount":464.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430847},{"amount":59.35,"local_amount":698.18,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:57Z","rounded_local_amount":716.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850108},{"amount":103.25,"local_amount":1214.72,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1245.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292382},{"amount":83.96,"local_amount":987.74,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1013.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160640},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":1397.04,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1433,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233518},{"amount":21.18,"local_amount":249.22,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":255.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512379}],"funded_date":"2011-01-24T21:38:20Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":272043,"name":"Adjoa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adjoa N. operates a food joint at Abbrem Agona near Abura Cape Coast.

She purchases rice in large quantities from local farmers and resells it to retail customers at several traditional markets.\r\n\r\nIn order to assist her parents, Adelfina also sells solid palm sugar produced by her family. However, this depends on the season because the palm trees only produce liquid once a year, from April to November. \r\n\r\nAdelfina intends to increase her product quantity as rice is the staple food for the community in general. She would like to purchase one ton of rice from the supplier. Therefore, she is seeking a loan of 10,000,000 IDR. She is expecting TLM will assist her by providing a loan for the continuity of her business.

He lives with 24-year-old Mariluz and the couple have one daughter called Karol who is 3 years old.  They live together in their own home which is built from rudimentary materials and wood, and has a roof made from metal sheets.  The farmland that David managed to buy through a lot of hard work is the only source of support for the members of his family.  He applies modern technology to growing his crops and, for this reason, they are very much in demand in the town of San Francisco.  He harvests very good quality cacao, coffee and sesame seeds, so his produce sells at good prices.\r\n\r\nWhat David most enjoys about his work is protecting his crops from pests as the pests attack the flowers of each of his crops without mercy.  He has been in this line of work for five years and he considers the most difficult part to be transporting the heavy sacks of produce from his farm to the drying areas as this entails a one hour walk.\r\n\r\nDavid is requesting this loan to buy sacks of manure so that he can improve his land and thereby later harvest very good quality fruit in abundance.  He will later buy more plots of land so that he can sow more cacao plants as this is a durable product.  This will be David's first loan from MFP and he is very happy to know that he will have financial support as this will make him feel safe in moving forward with his planned project.  He therefore pledges to make his repayments on time.  He will use the 3,000 soles to buy sacks of manure to fertilize his land."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":864518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sacks of manure","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-11T10:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":212.69},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":213.02},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":217.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":228.09},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":233.54},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":242},{"due_date":"2012-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":254.68},{"due_date":"2012-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":259.97},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":270.73},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":278.14},{"due_date":"2012-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":290.64},{"due_date":"2012-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":299.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.99},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.1},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.72},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.64},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.63},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.73},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.38},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.26},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.99},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.57},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.99,"local_amount":212.69,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:47Z","rounded_local_amount":212.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851270},{"amount":78.1,"local_amount":213.02,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":213.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666453},{"amount":79.72,"local_amount":217.42,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:04Z","rounded_local_amount":217.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621605},{"amount":83.77,"local_amount":228.45,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:51Z","rounded_local_amount":228.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835688},{"amount":780.42,"local_amount":2128.42,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2128.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245460}],"funded_date":"2011-09-11T16:56:45Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":337625,"name":"Annie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annie is married with two children.

She has been running her salon business for ten years now. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is there are so many people doing the same kind of business as hers in the area and so customers are spoilt for choice. However she works very hard to keep her business doing well. She is using her loan of Kes 50,000 to buy hair relaxers, treatments, weaves and other hair additions.

Her husband Santos works in construction in a neighboring country. They have two children in elementary school. She said her husband had to immigrate to another country because what he could earn locally was not enough to provide for the family. The money he has sent home has allowed her to start a business raising and selling sheep. The business has allowed her to improve her children's lives. She has been building a house little by little; they used to have a wooden house, but the cold entered the house and they frequently got sick. She will use the loan to purchase sheep because the highest demand is in December and January during the Christmas season. She will also buy vaccines and animal feed for her animals. Olivia's goal is to have a large flock, so that if there is an emergency she can sell and animal instead of worrying about how to find the money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":970043,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"raise and sell sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-01-23T02:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olivia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1498.69},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1560.63},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1643.65},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1693.08},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1767.86},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1836.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.4},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.05},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.27},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.98},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.59},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.4,"local_amount":1498.69,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1507.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193951},{"amount":117.05,"local_amount":1560.63,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1570.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330310},{"amount":123.17,"local_amount":1642.32,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:42:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1652.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044328},{"amount":127.08,"local_amount":1694.41,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:50:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1704.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656520},{"amount":132.42,"local_amount":1765.55,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:55:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1776.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283317194},{"amount":137.88,"local_amount":1838.4,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1849.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287418657}],"funded_date":"2012-01-23T05:02:33Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:16:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick  King","image":null}},{"id":795,"name":"Kim Sreang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>H.

She has nine children, the youngest still in primary school.  For the last sixteen years she has worked selling tortillas.  She buy the corn by the quintal (46 kilograms), and she gets up very early to grind it.  She leaves the corn soaking at night, forms the tortillas in the morning, and then sells them to her customers.  She thanks God for having allowed her to have her own business.   For many years she worked as a domestic servant, but that work was poorly paid and very tiring.  Now she is able to watch over her children and her home.\r\nWith the loan she will buy construction materials such as: stone, sand, cement, and zinc to finish dividing up the rooms.  Her wood  and zinc house is small and simple, and now very old.  She hasn\u2019t been able to improve the house for her family because of lack of money.

All the members are merchants.  Yolanda and Sebastiana sell candy.  Maleny, Luisa, and Alicia sell food.  Yadira has a small beauty shop.  Marcela sells cloth napkins.  Dominga sells fruits and vegetables, Ambrosia has a general store, and Beda raises livestock.  Alicia, a member of the group, is married and has a young daughter in primary school.  She sells prepared food from her house.  With this loan, she would like to buy tables and chairs, as well as a little candy, to sell in her locale so she can increase her profits.  She tells us that she feels very comfortable as a part of this group; she had worked in others, but did not enjoy it because there were too many problems.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  a general store and buying and selling appliances\/jewelry. Her husband Efren, who is 58 years old, works as a market supervisor to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children between 29 to 34 years old who already have families of their own. \r\n\r\nRebecca joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 22 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rebecca has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 50,000 helped her earn a monthly income of PHP 40,500, increasing the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 23rd loan, she is borrowing PHP 50,000, which she intends to use to pay for more stock for her rice retail and general store so that she can continue to save up for future expansion and improvement of her business. Rebecca is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.
