He has a taxi that he works with every day, while Ledys spends her time at home doing the daily chores.<br \/>She has always had a spirit of improvement, of being able to help her family. This is why she has worked selling clothing as a street vendor. Because of her daughter's studies she had to stay at home. Now she has a dream that she is carrying out little by little . She needs to start a business, for which she has already bought displays and a freezer.

The proliferation of this business makes the competition stiff, hence store owners try many techniques to make it stable and competitive. <br \/><br \/>Emelyn, 52, from Fatima, General Santos City adds photocopying services to her variety store business. In this way, students who want to photocopy some documents can be her captured buyers. Her income helps sustain their daily expenditures and supplements her husband\u2019s salary as a government employee. But her forward-looking mindset drives her to further improve her business. She aspires to buy school supplies to combine with the photocopying services. Aside from this, she will also retail cellphone load, buy additional grocery items and sacks of rice. A loan worth PHP 50,000 would be enough for this purpose. It will surely bring higher profits for her and her family. <br \/><br \/>In due time, Emelyn hopes that she can convert her sari-sari into a big grocery store with wide array of merchandise. She prays for a more comfortable life in the near future.

Here, this motivated man started his business of wheel repair. His service starts with inspection. If there is a small hole in the tire or it has lost air, it might not be always necessary to change it. Rather, it would be fixed according to techniques such as handcrafted patches, valve change, tire change, among other services.

My sister is not able to find a job without education and it horrifies the rest of us, that I also may have such a fate. Not to repeat her destiny, I was a diligent student at school and was active in after-class activities. Choosing AUCA and having passed the entrance exams successfully, my parents started to search for funding, as their salaries don\u2019t enable them to pay the tuition. The Scholarships and Financial Aid Office of AUCA told us about interest free Kiva loan for AUCA students, so we thought that we found what we were looking for. I would like to note that Kiva is the only interest free loan given for education in our country, so it is my last variant to find money for tuition.

But his income is inconsistent and they find it hard to depend on his income. So to earn additional income, Ranjana has been engaged in a milk-selling business for four years.  Now to develop her business, she wants to purchase a dairy cow to rear and sell milk. She thinks it will earn more profit as cow's milk is in great demand in her locality.

American University in Central Asia is one of the prestigious universities in Asia, and it has such needed funding through Kiva.

I have been a humanist since my childhood. I preferred learning by heart all kinds of structures like 'present simple' or 'pass\u00e9 compose'. The clarifying factor of choosing the European Studies Department is that I want to master a second foreign language, also I want to learn more about history, geography and the culture of Europe. I would like to do research on European rights, its international economic relations, and also the European Union\u2019s safety. It\u2019s exciting to be an expert on the western world, which really differs from the Asian one.\r\nI am applying to Kiva for a loan to help my parents in finding a solution to our financial difficulties. We are five in our family: my parents, me, my younger brother and younger sister. My father was a taxi driver his whole life, my mother is a house wife as she had to take care of my younger siblings. We live in the two bedroom apartment of my grandmother as we don\u2019t have our own estate or car. Two years ago my father tried to open his own business where he brought Japanese cars to Kyrgyzstan to sell them here. Unfortunately, last year our government outlawed the import of right-handed cars, so my father was forced to end the business. Now he is 40 years old and it\u2019s hard to find him a good and well paid job.\r\nLooking back and at the present, I understand that my parents had hard times through life, but they struggled to give us a good education. From my side, I had done my best in my studies at school, participated in all after class activities like language and musical contests, Olympiads and sport competitions. I loved my school, my teachers and classmates. Now I have great expectations for the AUCA community and I am happy to be a member of it thanks to financial aid and this Kiva loan.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1981621,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for her higher education costs at AUCA","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bishkek","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":326,"posted_date":"2015-09-21T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-21T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nurai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":70,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-09-21T14:31:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca Johnston","image":142987}},{"id":949807,"name":"Cyrus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cyrus is an entrepreneur from Mukuru kwa Reuben. Having experienced poor sanitation first hand, he is passionate about sanitation and along with his peers they began a youth group focused on improving sanitation in their home area. Together, they have established and operate three Fresh Life franchises.\r\n\r\nAs Cyrus says, the Fresh Life Toilet has been a good sanitation solution in their area that does not have a connected sewerage system for safe disposal of waste.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, Cyrus set out to establish a school, Cyrock Academy.

I am from Tajikistan. I have chosen the Sociology Department because of the social issues in Tajikistan. Sociology emphasizes approaches to social problems after analysing the situation. My Motherland\u2019s society is too weak. The economics is undeveloped. There is a high rate of corruption because of many civil wars. Despite the fact that most of the people are educated, they are not able to find jobs as unemployment is another problem. There are many universities in my country, but they can\u2019t be compared to the western universities. So one of my goals is to gain complete knowledge and practical skills at AUCA, not just for me and my family, but also for my lovely country, where I will live and work the rest of my life.<br \/><br \/>I have a brother, who is also a student. My father is searching for a job, and my mother is the only financial supporter of my family. My mother\u2019s salary is about 1,200 Tajik Somoni per month, around 188 USD. After paying for living expenses, my brother\u2019s tuition fees and my travel expenses to Bishkek, my parents are having a really hard time. AUCA gave me partial financial aid in paying for my degree. This is an appreciable step, but my parents still need the rest of the payment. I have never heard about Kiva before and was so glad to learn about it at AUCA. As you know, the Central Asian countries are less developed, so we don\u2019t have interest free loans for education at local banks. I am happy to have such an opportunity now and will pay it back after graduation. I express gratitude to the Kiva organization and its lenders, who care about other people and their difficulties.\u201d"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1981623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for his Bachelor Degree at AUCA","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Khorog, Tajikistan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":326,"posted_date":"2015-09-21T02:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-21T02:10:04Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ardasher","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":70,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-08T18:43:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Peggy","image":1683516}},{"id":949808,"name":"Madina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cMy name is Madina. I am 17-years-old Dungan girl with big ambitions. People in our country know that Dungan is a patriarchal community and women are house-wives. I want to break the rules and I want to be independent in the future, and I am motivated to achieve everything by myself and to show others that women can act and make their life by themselves too. Another curious idea in me is that my purpose in life is to be a software engineer. Many people consider that this profession doesn\u2019t suit girls and that men are the best engineers, I don\u2019t agree with this opinion. The idea of being an IT-specialist was born in me, while I watched lots of feature films and documentaries. I saw what an important role computer technologies play in our life; how they can facilitate life, contribute in discoveries on space exploration, medicine, economy, etc. I wanted to learn how it works and decided to find out.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, technology is not developed in Kyrgyzstan, in addition to this there aren\u2019t many universities, where we can get good knowledge on it. I chose AUCA, because it is the only place in my country, where I can get advanced teaching methods and best resources to gain my goals. I know that many AUCA Alumni work at international IT organizations such as Google, Microsoft, Cisco, etc.\r\n\r\nAs to financial support that I am asking from Kiva lenders, I am really in need of it.  As I stated above, my mother is a house-wife, so my father is the only supporter of six of us: I have 3 siblings. We spend the most part of our money for food, education, transportation, and medicine, as me, my mother, and my elder sister have must visit the doctor every six months due to an eye condition. Therefore, I ask for a help of Kiva lenders and want to assure you that your loan will make a difference for my family.\u201d\r\n

These courses are given under the agreement with Fautapo and Cea Thaqu Thaqu which are institutions that provide training and support for productive undertakings in the region.<br \/><br \/>For the characteristics mentioned in the training Wara Nicole requires a loan to invest in grape plants, poles, wires and others to grow grapes. This is an initiative of Wara Nicole who has the experience and is also very enthusiastic about the project that she has to produce grapes and offer them on the market. <br \/><br \/>Currently Wara Nicole works in agriculture producing potatoes, carrots and beans. She has learned about farming since she was young from the knowledge of her parents in this area and because she has land to carry out this activity."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1980419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to buy grape plants, posts, wire and others to grow grapes for the market, in this way generate economic income and improve her quality of living.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Mizque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2015-09-21T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-21T03:00:03Z","loan_amount":4975,"lender_count":154,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wara Nicole","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":34000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":39,"loan_amount":4975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2016-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2016-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2017-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2017-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2017-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2017-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2018-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2018-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2833.33},{"due_date":"2018-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":414.59},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.59},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.59},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.58},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":414.58},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.58},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.58},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.58},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":414.58},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.58},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.58},{"due_date":"2018-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":414.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-20T01:19:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":950077,"name":"Partria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Partria is 55 years old and married with four children. <br \/><br \/>Partria is in the agricultural business, raising livestock in the Philippines.
