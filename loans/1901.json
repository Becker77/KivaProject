He is an entrepreneur who saw in arts and crafts an opportunity for business in order to come up in life and fund his studies.  With the support of his parents who raised the initial money he was able to buy his first products; among which were hammocks, bags, and backpacks made in San Jacinto.  This is a region known for making arts and crafts and is even considered the first craft center of the Atlantic coast and the first marketer of products produced on a vertical loom like hammocks and their variety.  The region also produces crochet and macrame products, as well as wooden products, saddlery, and instruments like the guitar and others.<br \/><br \/>Rafael's main customers are located in other cities. He sells to them through orders and installments.  Nevertheless, his capital is insufficient in order to continue timely management of his orders, which is why he is applying for his first Kiva loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

She has a display case in a corner of her store where she displays perfumes, earrings, lipsticks and other products for sale. She says that \"women come in for kitchen goods and end up buying some cosmetics too.\"\r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that she can sell both types of products in the same place.

One of his greatest ambitions is to be able to make improvements to his home and thus be able to start a small business that will allow him to sell food ready for consumption and generate more income for the family.<br \/><br \/>In the community where Gonzalo lives there is no access to electricity, for which they must get light from kerosene lamps. This makes it difficult to perform their domestic chores at night, since his wife has to prepare food with little lighting, his son who is in school must do his homework also exposed to the toxic smoke from the lamps, and Gonzalo must walk long distances and pay to charge his cellphone.<br \/><br \/>All of this has become very difficult for Gonzalo.

This is Supriyatna, one of Ruma's agents. He lives in Depok, a suburban area located about a one-hour drive from Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. He lives there with his wife and his only daughter. He owns and manages a small stall where he sells daily consumer products and mobile airtime credits. He decided to join Ruma because he wants to try another business opportunity.<br \/><br \/>As the business grows, Supriyatna needs additional capital and is seeking a working capital loan from Kiva. He will use the capital to provide more mobile airtime credits for his community, so his community can connect with their loved ones no matter how far they are apart. Supriyatna's goal towards Ruma in the near future is to open an e-commerce business for his community, with Ruma\u2019s latest product called Mapan. As seen in the photo, Supriyatna is the one who is standing in his own small stall.

is a positive and hard-working woman. She is married and has five children. She lives in a small rural village. Since her childhood, Muqaddas dreamed of becoming a teacher, but circumstances did not work out for her to get a higher education due to her family's financial limitations. Muqaddas got married immediately after completing secondary school, and she became a homemaker. But even while being constantly at home, Muqaddas never sits idle. She and her husband try to do everything possible in order to provide their children with all the essentials.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a regular income for food, Muqaddas and her husband began their own business. They rear animals. Muqaddas rears cattle, then sells the meat and milk she gets from them. Muqaddas receives a good income from this business. Muqaddas's husband also works in a local workshop and his work brings the family additional income. Their combined income is sufficient for living at a modest level, but for the time being they do not have enough funds to cover all of the needs that they have. At the present time Muqaddas and her husband want to buy a few more heads of livestock for fattening up. For this reason she has applied to Arvand and wants to receive a loan to buy some cattle. Muqaddas is grateful to Arvand in advance for its support as a result of which her family's quality of life will improve."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1979702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy some cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-09-21T20:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-21T20:30:04Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muqaddas","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":523.24},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":554.82},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":568.65},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":590.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":614.4},{"due_date":"2016-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":648.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.22},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.18},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.36},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.77},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.55},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-19T12:27:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":950353,"name":"Herminia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Herminia is 51 years old and married with four children.<br \/><br \/>She is in the agricultural business of pig fattening in the Philippines.

All the money that she makes is spent to support her family and she can't save any of her earnings for other long-term goals.\r\n\r\nHosiyat wants to increase her business because she is receiving an increased demand for the clothes that she makes.  However, she doesn't have enough financial resources and, for this reason, she is turning to Kiva's partner, MDO Arvand, in order to get a loan which will help her to increase her working capital.
