He works with his family in the business of growing vegetables, basic grains and coffee. During a long time they have had to work hard to have the assets they own today, because farming demands many sacrifices such as getting up very early in the morning. This is difficult for Juan because at that time it is still dark, and also because there is no electrical energy in the community where he lives. Because of this, it is difficult to do so. He needs to get ready, which also pertains the food preparation his wife finds difficult because of the lack of light. They need to use kerosene lamps and candles for lighting. Additionally, Juan and his family must travel long distances to charge their cell phones, all which generates additional costs. For these reasons, Juan is looking to offer his family a good future. He is requesting this loan to Soluz Honduras to buy a solar system to offer a better quality of life by having good lighting and saving in purchasing lamps which have been damaging to their health."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":35.97,"image":{"id":1981562,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy a solar system for lighting which will contribute to improve his family's life condition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Atlantida","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":390,"posted_date":"2015-09-22T01:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-22T01:40:07Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":761.29},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":772.71},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":784.3},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":796.06},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":808},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":820.12},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":832.43},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":844.91},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":857.59},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":870.45},{"due_date":"2016-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":883.51},{"due_date":"2016-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":896.76},{"due_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":910.21},{"due_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":923.86},{"due_date":"2016-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":937.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.97},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.51},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.05},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.17},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.74},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.92},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.52},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.12},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.74},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.37},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.65},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.97,"local_amount":761.29,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-19T13:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":783.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752258355}],"funded_date":"2015-09-29T20:39:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Mueller","image":null}},{"id":949746,"name":"Las \u00d1ustas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cLAS \u00d1USTAS\u201d; Este banco se ubicada en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

With the help of this loan, she can purchase the clothes easily to fulfill her business needs so that she can earn more profitable income to support her family and business.<br \/><br \/>For this financial assistance, Rubina is very thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":27.87,"image":{"id":1982899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Job Creation"],"use":"to increase her clothing business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Rawalpindi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":247,"posted_date":"2015-09-22T04:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-22T04:40:03Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rubina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2787},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2876},{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2968},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3063},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3161},{"due_date":"2016-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3262},{"due_date":"2016-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3367},{"due_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3474},{"due_date":"2016-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3586},{"due_date":"2016-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3700},{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3819},{"due_date":"2016-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3937}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.76},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.68},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.63},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.61},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.62},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.74},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.86},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.19},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":27.87,"local_amount":2787,"processed_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-20T13:29:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2908.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":753604671}],"funded_date":"2015-10-22T04:38:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":950506,"name":"Wendy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wendy is a married woman with five children.

This is her story:<br \/><br \/>\"I was born and raised in a small village in the state of Guerrero, and I learned at a very young age how to paint on ceramic. My father taught me, and I can still remember the very first piece I painted \u2013 it was a lizard. Due to our family's financial situation I was only able to go to primary school. Painting and decorating ceramic not only represents a way to make a living, but to me it's an art form that allows me to express my feelings and capture the beauty of nature.\"<br \/><br \/>\"I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for all of your support. The first loan I received allowed me to grow my humble little business, and so I'm quite excited to receive this new loan. Before I started selling online, it was practically impossible to support my family selling my art -- so I had to take on all kinds of odd jobs to make ends meet. Now, I can dedicate myself fully to my craft, and I have my mother and my sisters working with me, helping me grow. I cannot always find the right words to convey the depth of my gratitude and happiness for all you have done for me.

He operates a store of used clothes in one of the commercial establishments in Toril, Davao City. He offers jeans, slack pants, shorts, t-shirts, blouses, bags, and household items like bed sheets and blankets. Now he would like to add more selections of hot items to entice the buyers. He needs PhP 25,000 additional capital to procure boxes of used clothes, including sweaters and jackets, which are in demand this rainy season. He also plans to include stuffed toys and accessories. He hopes you are willing to help him so he can increase his profit, sustain his family\u2019s daily needs, and boost his savings. \r\n\r\nAllan is married and has a son who is studying in college. He wants to see his son with a stable job someday. He is a compliant member of CCT Credit Cooperative and meets with his co-fellowship* members every week to inspire and strengthen each other through the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":206.28,"image":{"id":1980870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to procure boxes of used clothes including sweaters and jackets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Davao City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"7.073056 125.612778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-09-22T16:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-22T16:10:03Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Allan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1041.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":206.28,"local_amount":9375.03,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:14:42Z","rounded_local_amount":9594.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045566}],"funded_date":"2015-10-16T00:24:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":950657,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a dried fish vending business in the Philippines. <br \/><br \/>She is borrowing PHP 10,000 through NWTF to buy ingredients and more fish for her business.<br \/><br \/>Rose has been in this business for 10 years.

Also, the business does not require much capital.  \r\n\r\nAt this time, Nelfida is taking her first loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.

She is 28 years old and very skilled when it comes to managing money. She is also very enterprising, and good with people.<br \/><br \/>A few years ago Eliana accepted a proposal to work with her mother, who made a living selling cleaning kits. This work provided the pair with a good profit margin, and was Eliana's starting point in business as gradually she purchased a display case and stocked it up with stationery, accessories, gifts and more. Eliana thus opened a miscellany in her home, which is open from 8am until 8pm, Monday to Saturday.

She not only takes care of her children but has to take care of her four young grandchildren and elderly husband of 85 years. <br \/><br \/>Masetla lives in a traditional hut that is not well ventilated, nor warms up well in winter. She works long hours although difficult with her leg injury to ensure there is enough food for her entire family, some of whom are going to school and only help her on Saturdays and Sundays. She has to wake up very early, between 3am and 4am, during the week to start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water and warming the house for all the children before they go to school. <br \/><br \/>Collecting firewood, setting up the fire and doing the actual cooking demands a lot of her time. Temperatures in the Lesotho highlands are never really high; winters can get very cold and often Masetla has to start the fire inside her hut. Starting a fire releases smog and smoke which when inhaled in large quantities over a period of time can lead to lung diseases, eye problems and in the worst case to death. In these circumstances, life for women like Masetla has been very difficult. <br \/><br \/>Masetla has requested a loan from Kiva lenders, in order to be able to purchase clean cook stoves which provide her and 13 other people from her village, who are living in similar circumstances. The chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families and that does not require a lot of fuel, which is hard to find in Lesotho, nor expensive paraffin and gas. This stove can be started with the use of very little, readily available biomass like dry twigs and dry cow dung that do not require lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the homes. <br \/><br \/>This stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery which runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones and a mini LED lamp.
