She shares her life with her husband who works in transportation, and with her children who study in school. They live in a rented brick house that has all the basic services. The need to improve her business brought her to form a bank of people with businesses such as: ceiling and wall painting; a locksmith; a food vendor; a second-hand clothes vendor; a natural health products vendor; a traditional baker; and a bookstore owner.\r\nHer business is cosmetics sales such as: eyeliner, lipstick, foundation, concealer, and others. \"I go over long distances searching for my clients. No one visits in vain, they always end up taking something,\" she comments. The advantage of her business is that the sales are on credit and she can sell more; the disadvantage is that she receives the payments in installments and it diminishes the capital to reinvest in her business. Her dream is to open a store in order to give up walking. She wants to buy wholesale cosmetics in order to continue selling on credit.

After many years of experience running his taxi business, he was able to pay for necessary registration to become an official taxi driver and insurance. He was able to quickly get set up with a local agency that helped him develop his initial clients.\n\nHis greatest success in running his business has been the ability to attract repeat clients who prefer his local, personalized service. His largest difficulty is competition from new taxi companies that are growing from New York into the New Jersey area. Ivan is currently seeking a loan to pay for membership fees with a new agency that will help his business stay competitive. His customer base keeps his business running steadily and this loan will help him improve his business. \n\nIvan is married and has two young children.

It is extremely mountainous, with steep slopes and deep ravines. Many types of trees grow there, among them the eucalyptus, which has inspired the name of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank group 'Eucalipto'. The eight women range in age from 19 to 49 years, and have elementary and high school educations. They all are mothers with between four and six children each. These hardworking women have small businesses such as convenience stores, tortilla shops, fast food shops, and a cosmetic catalogue business. This is their second loan cycle with Friendship Bridge and their first with Kiva.\r\n\r\nThe enterprising Elvia, who is 34 years old with six children and a sixth-grade education, is asking for a loan in order to open a second convenience store, as well as a tortilla shop. She wants to buy sugar, beans, salt, noodles for the convenience shop and corn along with wood for the tortilla shop. Elvia wants to increase the income from her shops in order to make certain her children will all have a good education and a prosperous future. \r\n\r\nKiva investors are an important part of the process of microloans and education that Friendship Bridge calls 'Microcredit Plus'. It is a program combining the loans from Kiva and non-formal education from Friendship Bridge presented at the monthly meetings of Eucalipto by a facilitator from the organization, who engages the group with drawings about topics, pictures and role-playing. These educational topics range from health and hygiene to important business management tools.

Meet Judith, 37, a vibrant, energetic, hard-working and focused farmer. She hails from the Kitale area which is one of the most backward, rural towns in Kenya. The condition of the village in the town speaks for itself as basic requirements such as clean water and electricity are missing. However, despite these challenges, Judith loves farming. Judith practices mixed farming, and through that she has been able to take care of her aging parents. <br \/><br \/>Not everything has been good for this humble and hard-working mum. The Kitale area has a ready market for poultry products and eggs, and Judith, being an enterprising person, would want to take advantage of that and make profits. That is why she is kindly seeking a loan to start poultry farming. Judith has got enough space on her farm and wants to make use of the space through poultry farming. Other than income from selling eggs and poultry products, poultry will also provide manure to use in her farm, hence the money that could have been used in buying it will be saved. Judith projects that after a few months she will have more income to buy more poultry and also pay back the loan.<br \/><br \/>Judith has many dreams, but paying for her 7 children's education is her biggest one, because she hopes they can be professionals and make a great life for themselves. A little help can do a lot for Judith and her family.

Her family is a low-income household in the village. This region often suffers from natural disasters such as storms because it is near the sea. Therefore, the income from sea products businesses is unstable. It is really difficult for her to cover life expenses and to save money. The main hardship that Nhung faces is the lack of capital. She is requesting a loan to purchase more fresh seafood to resell. In 2010, Nhung joined the Thanh Hoa microfinance institution to improve her business.

She trusts your good heart to support her in her livelihood.

She is married to Roberto, a jeepney driver and has three children of whom one is in college and the other two are already working. Education is of primary importance to Filipinos to uplift their lives so the couple do their best to give their children a college education. <br \/><br \/>Helen operates the jeepney which her husband drives. Jeepneys are a unique public transportation found only in the Philippines. They are originally an American military service vehicle used during World War 2 and have been converted into a transportation vehicle by making them two meters longer and putting two long upholstered seats in them. Since then it has become the most common and cheapest form of public transportation. Aside from her jeepney she also has a boarding house for rent. <br \/><br \/>She hopes she could borrow funds in the amount of 30,000 PHP to  pay for the transmission and maintenance of her jeepney. A regular and proper maintenance of her vehicle is necessary to ensure efficient performance and steady income. Part of the loan she will also use for the renovation of her boarding house to attract more boarders. She trusts you could consider her request to sustain her livelihood thus fund her child's education and pay the monthly loan of their house.<br \/> <br \/>Helen hopes to acquire a new jeepney and expand her boarding house. She also prays for abundance in their lives. Every week, she faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God that she studies.<br \/><br \/> * All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.
