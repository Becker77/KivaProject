","en":"Farruh is 36 years old.  He is married and the father of five beautiful children.  When he was still a child he really enjoyed working with his dad in their garden and he always dreamed of having his own orchard one day.  Many years have passed and Farruh now has a large orchard where he grows several varieties of apples.  This activity constitutes the family's main source of income.  However, this is a seasonal activity and Farruh doesn't get an income year round.\r\n\r\nFarruh has a very large family (his elderly parents live with him), so he needs to take care of everyone.

She started in the livestock business after she got married, so that she could help her husband take care of the family. Slowly she gained experience and increased her herd. Zamirakhon bought young animals, fattened them, and then sold them for a higher price. After her husband\u2019s death, her livestock business became the main source of income for her family, and she is the sole breadwinner. She has to work hard every day to support her family. Zamirakhon is currently having financial difficulties and she needs support. She isn\u2019t able to sell livestock that she fattened due to low prices.

He is 22 years old. He was born in the center of the Spitamen Region.  He lives with his parents and earns an income by driving a taxi. This year proved lucky for Umin because he met his soul mate. The dreams of Umid's parents have also come true. They sent matchmakers to the bride and hosted a wedding. Now Umid is a responsible family man. He is using the income from his taxi to support his family.\r\n\r\nUmid' young wife, Lailo, had wanted to enter college after secondary school. However, this was not meant to be. Lailo told her husband of her dream to continue her studies, and Umid decided to help Lailo realize this dream. Lailo chose a university, took entrance exams and was admitted to the Banking major. Since she is in a student group that does not get a scholarship, she must pay the costs of her tuition, and is in need of funding. Umid was able to pay half of the amount himself. Having heard from his acquaintances about MDO Arvand's student loans, Umin has reached out to Arvand. He obtained a loan and paid the tuition for Lailo in full. Umid and Lailo express their heartfelt thanks to Arvand's officers for their help.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":22.65,"image":{"id":1980095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for college tuition [for his wife] and a computer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-09-24T03:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-24T03:40:03Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Umid","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":139.4},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":148.44},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":150.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":152.03},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":158.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":164.36},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":165.72},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":172.98},{"due_date":"2016-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":176.15},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":181.06},{"due_date":"2016-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":186.47},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":203.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.65},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.12},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.71},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.83},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.71},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.93},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.11},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.62},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.42},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":22.65,"local_amount":139.4,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:15:02Z","rounded_local_amount":144.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755520221}],"funded_date":"2015-09-24T08:01:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":951574,"name":"Flower Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sheilapaz is the featured borrower of Flower Group.

He is married. He was born and raised in agricultural areas, and so he has been used to labor since childhood. Hakim has a secondary-level education, and he works by fattening and buying and selling livestock. He buys livestock at the livestock market, fattens them up, and resells them. <br \/><br \/>In addition to this, his wife sells milk that they get from their cows, which brings them some supplementary income. Hakim's wife is a homemaker. She looks after the money, and she helps her husband watch after the livestock. <br \/><br \/>As we all know, the earnings that Hakim gets from selling livestock are not enough to support a family nowadays. Therefore, Hakim also works as a carpenter. However, this work is seasonal.

Her parents work at the local bazaar. Her two elder sisters are studying on full scholarships at the universities, so her parents are struggling to make ends meet. \r\n\r\nThe difficult financial situation of her family became an obstacle for her to get a higher education last year. So her classmates from her school are now sophomores, and Zhypara, having lost one year without funding, is now doing her best to find donors and be a freshman.\r\n\r\nShe decided not to wait until the day when her parents can afford her education, so she applied for financial aid of AUCA and got it. Now she hopes to get a Kiva loan, which will defer the part of her payment until she graduates. \r\n\r\nZhypara could go abroad like many people of Kyrgyzstan, to Russia for example, and make quick money. But she remembers her mother\u2019s career path; when she had a Red Diploma in accounting, she had to leave with her husband to Almaty\u2019s bazaar, so that they could repay their loans. After that, she got children and stayed as a house-wife. Zhypara is sorry for her mom, but promised to not repeat her steps and go with her own way as her sisters did.\r\n\r\nZhypara's main dream is to open her own social bank, like Muhammad Yunus, and help people of her country, especially women, to open their own businesses, even while they are at home. Zhypara believes that her studies at AUCA will help her to learn more about world practices and maybe even gather a team of groupmates, who will become her business partners in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1984352,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for her bachelor's degree in economics at AUCA","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bishkek","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":326,"posted_date":"2015-09-24T04:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-24T04:10:11Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zhypara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":70,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-09-24T16:10:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Morena Calvo","image":1832928}},{"id":951578,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The lady in the photo is Mary\u2014forty one years old, married and blessed with three children.

Eunice practices mixed farming. That is, she grows maize and keeps dairy cows, and through these activities she has been able to earn a decent and honest income.

She really enjoys taking care of her cows. \r\n\r\nAlthough Eunice has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious mum.

Through the loan, Eunice will be assured of a bumper harvest, and this will translate into more profits and cash. Through the use of good seeds and fertilizer, she will increase her profit margins. Through this loan, Eunice will be able to expand her farming business. \r\n\r\nShe sees a lot of room for improvement and growth. What is lacking is the capital to drive the positive change. With your loan, Eunice will make enough income to take care of her family and other farming expenses. She wakes up early and goes to sleep very late every day to give her family a decent living and afford her children proper education. Eunice has many dreams. The main one is to make her farming business successful so that one day her children can inherit it and keep it so they have something to provide for themselves. You can help Eunice to accomplish this dream and all her goals with just a loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":8.44,"image":{"id":1979097,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farm implements.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-09-24T07:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-24T07:30:04Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eunice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":707.73},{"due_date":"2015-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":728.4},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":749.7},{"due_date":"2016-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":771.61},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":794.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":817.37},{"due_date":"2016-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":841.26},{"due_date":"2016-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":865.84},{"due_date":"2016-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":891.15},{"due_date":"2016-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":917.19},{"due_date":"2016-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":944},{"due_date":"2016-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":971.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.94},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.17},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.41},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.66},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.91},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.17},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.44},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":8.44,"local_amount":844.13,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:29:59Z","rounded_local_amount":891.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112603}],"funded_date":"2015-09-24T12:54:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Moody","image":null}},{"id":950925,"name":"Wi\u00f1ay Kury Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cWI\u00d1AY KURY\u201d; Este banco se ubicada en el distrito de Cusco, perteneciente a la provincia de Quispicanchis y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

She went to school until the first year of high school. She was not able to continue for many circumstances that happened to her. In her family, she was the eldest of her siblings and for that reason, she had to work a lot to help her parents and her little siblings. <br \/><br \/>Now, she is married and her husband works with metallic structures and in agriculture. They have 2 children ages 7 and 4. From a young child, Santa has been a very laborious worker which has allowed her to get involved in many productive jobs, such as agriculture and livestock. Currently, she works selling clothing. She sells in her community and in the nearby areas. Many times she has to wake up early to prepare her children's food and go out to sell clothing. <br \/><br \/>Santa and her husband decided to ask for a loan to grow their food, because they do not have the economic resources for their agricultural jobs. For that reason, they are asking for a loan to buy agricultural supplies such as seeds, fertilizers and products to protect the plantations. This will greatly improve their family conditions because they will be able to have the money to invest in their crops and have sufficient food for the family to eat. <br \/><br \/>Santa wants to take advantage of the rainy season to get a good production in her crops. She also wants to improve her house because the one that she has does not have basic security."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1983451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy agricultural supplies such as seeds, fertilizers and products to protect the plantations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Osicala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2015-09-24T08:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-24T08:50:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santa Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-09-25T22:53:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mara Nagaki","image":1678927}},{"id":951452,"name":"Romy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Romy earned a living through services.

The profits derived from her business help provide for the basic needs of her family. However, the risk that she faces is the possibility of vegetables rotting if they are not sold on time. Somehow, Charity has learned the trade tips from her eight years of experience in vegetable vending. She also knows how to compete with other vendors by opening her store much earlier than others. \r\n\r\nNow she desires to buy more vegetables to display in her stall in order to attract more buyers. Aside from this, she plans to add various grocery items and beverages to widen the selection in her store. She implores your kind support to make these things possible. A loan worth PHP 15,000 will surely go a long way. \r\n\r\nCharity is married to Renades and they have four children in high school and elementary levels. The couple diligently works towards their goal to improve their business, uplift their lives, and finish the schooling of their children.\r\n\r\nCharity is a devoted member of CCT Credit Cooperative and she meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and their religion. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Of course, it does disturb them and bring in some inconvenience, but they have to get used to it if they want to earn a living.\r\n\r\nFamily conditions don\u2019t prevent Amantur from dreaming and going forward. He says that all these circumstances make him stronger, smarter and more responsible for his life. He understands that as the eldest son of his parents, he is responsible for their future and he should prove their expectations.

She is an independent, very hard working entrepreneur who runs her business in the area called \"Villa Fatima\", where the bus station is located on the way out of the city toward villages in the north.\r\n\r\nJuana has a dark complexion, a wrinkled face and is short in height.  Her mother tongue is Aymara and she speaks Spanish.  Her partner works as a driver and they live in their own brick house which has running water, electricity and a sewage system.\r\n\r\nHer business involves selling fast food, including hamburgers, hot dogs, sandwiches and other items.  \"I began the business out of necessity to help my partner...\" she says.  The advantage of her stall is that it is near a shopping area.  The disadvantage is the lack of money to buy shelving for her food.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to finish building her house and buy shelving for her business.  This is her first loan through the institution in the 15 years she has been in business.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy shelves to display her products."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":135.72,"image":{"id":1983484,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy a shelf to display her products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-09-24T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-24T13:40:02Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":72.34},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":63.38},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62.23},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":64.73},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":68.94},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":67.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":77.11},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":80.27},{"due_date":"2016-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":82.27},{"due_date":"2016-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":86.61},{"due_date":"2016-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":87.27},{"due_date":"2016-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":94.17},{"due_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":97.06},{"due_date":"2016-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":99.76},{"due_date":"2016-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":105.15},{"due_date":"2017-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":108.56},{"due_date":"2017-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":105.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.34},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.23},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.73},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.94},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.11},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.25},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.27},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.27},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.61},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.27},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.17},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.06},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.76},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.15},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.56},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.82}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":135.72,"local_amount":135.72,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:08:07Z","rounded_local_amount":135.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752077206}],"funded_date":"2015-10-22T23:05:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":950962,"name":"Chicas Emprendedoras Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEl grupo Chicas Emprendedoras est\u00e1 integrado por siete mujeres trabajadoras quienes tienen el firme prop\u00f3sito de superarse y sacar adelante a sus familia.

Most rural families in Kabwe District grow maize on their small farms and store it and use it as their primary supply of food for the year. After the kernels are removed from the cob, they then have to be milled to create flour, which can then be boiled to make what is locally called Nshima. <br \/><br \/>Rent-to-Own has done market research in Margress community and has determined that the location for this equipment is good.

Unfortunately, the upfront costs of such a maize mill are very prohibitive. Once she secures a loan, Margress will be able to get an engine for a maize mill from Rent-to-Own, which will deliver the equipment, as well as provide training on how to use and maintain it.

The local people go to a large dam on their small boats called chalupas which date back to prehispanic times. The dam is well-regarded by the local people as it provides electricity from a plant built on the edge of the dam. It isn't surprising that the group from this area is called Las Mojarritos.<br \/><br \/>The members of the group are Selene who sells bottled water; Alejandra, Marina and Valentina who sell local dishes; Juana who raises cattle; Reya who sells clothing; Jos\u00e9 and Felipe who sell wood; Pedro who sells fish; and Cristina and Alejandro who fish for sea bream.<br \/><br \/>Sra. Juana and her husband Hugo are very friendly and hardworking people who have lived all their lives in the countryside. It was her son who encouraged Juana to start to raise cattle. Ever since he was a child he always wanted to have a ranch with many cows, and when they gave him his first calf, he called it To\u00f1ita. Since then they have continued with this work and now have a paddock where cows can eat the grass, run around, sleep, and breed. In various advantageous spots they have built feeding and drinking troughs where the animals can develop in optimum conditions.<br \/><br \/>While Juana brings loan money to the table, her son buys the cattle as well as looking after them including taking them to the vet when necessary. The money they earn is used to pay for household and personal expenses. <br \/><br \/>In a similar way Juana has started raising poultry and sheep. With a smile on her face she says that she hopes to fulfil her dream and own a small farm.

She is married and has two children. She  enjoys raising livestock; this work involves many challenges and difficulties, because the animals can get sick if they do not get their vaccinations or other necessary medications on time. When animals are neglected and underfed, they can lose weight and stop producing offspring. Therefore Odinakhon\u2019s son and husband help her in this work. Odinakhon is a reliable person and has a close-knit family. In order to provide for her family, Odinakhon has to work hard. She raises livestock and processes milk. Her husband also helps her in this. They use their income from their cattle business and milk sales to support their family, and also help their aged parents as much as they can. Odinakhon would like to give a good education for her children. This is her dream because she did not have access to a good education herself. \r\n\r\nIn order to realize her dream, Odinakhon needs to keep working and developing her business. She lacks a small amount of money to increase her cattle headcount. In the past Odinakhon already took out a loan from Arvand, and since she found the loan conditions and the bank services satisfactory, she decided to reach out to Arvand again. At present she applied for a loan to buy cattle. She is really hoping for support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":111.18,"image":{"id":1973561,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle.

Her children are all attending school from elementary to high school.  She is very proud that she can provide a good life and education for her children with the earnings from her business.  When she first began receiving loans from Friendship Bridge five years ago, she did not see much growth in her income but little by little her income has grown to the point where she has been able to buy 3 properties where she has raised goats and chickens.  Now, in a first loan cycle with KIVA investors, she is asking for a loan to buy two goats and two cows. \n\nThe women of \u201cFlor de Anona\u201d enthusiastically report that they have been very prompt in repaying their loans and look forward to the monthly educational sessions that the Friendship Bridge Facilitator provides.  The women grow stronger, more empowered and have more self-esteem that they then pass on to their families.  The generosity of KIVA investors helps to make this happen.

La carne que ocupan es de oveja y su sabor es \u00fanico pues la receta que ocupan tiene ingredientes especiales que la familia ha usado por generaciones. \n   Todos los d\u00edas Hermenegilda se levanta desde muy temprano para tener lista la verdura, las salsas y, desde luego, las tortillas; cualquier esfuerzo vale la pena con tal de consentir a sus clientes. Por su parte, su esposo Crescencio de dedica a preparar la carne, en promedio venden de dos a tres ovejas por semana dependiendo la temporada. \u201cMientras yo preparo los tacos mi esposo despacha los refrescos y, por higiene, se encarga de cobrar a los clientes\u201d comenta. \nEl pr\u00e9stamo le ser\u00e1 de utilidad pues lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de chile, ma\u00edz, servilletas, platos, vasos, le\u00f1a y  refresco. Las ganancias les permiten solventar los gastos de la casa, reinvierten en la compra de materia prima y animales; \u201csoy feliz con mi actividad, con mi familia y con mi escuela pues nunca es tarde para iniciar, gracias por cada oportunidad que nos brindan de crecer\u201d.\n   Por otra parte, est\u00e1 contenta ya que asiste a una escuela para adultos en donde le han ense\u00f1ado a leer y escribir, y ahora comienza a realizar cuentas matem\u00e1ticas. \n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en casa de Guadalupe, Do\u00f1a Hermenegilda viste blusa estampada, pantal\u00f3n rojo y est\u00e1 cargando a su nieto.  \n","en":"A community in Oaxaca is famous because the large train known as \"la bestia\" (the beast) passes through it.  Many stories come and go on the railway, from workers who come to transport molasses, glass or sugar, to people in search of the \"American dream\".  Many doctors also come to the community by way of the health train.\r\n\r\nThe community is where the communal bank called Alcatraz was formed.  The name is for a flower that the members like, they are: Martina and Hermenegilda who sell tacos; Adriana who sells typical foods; Yesenia, snack foods; Rufino, fish; Teodora, ice; and Guadalupe and Constantina who sell soft drinks.\r\n\r\nFor eight years Hermenegilda has been selling tacos since her husband inherited the tradition from his family who were in the business many years.  The meat they use is lamb and they have a unique recipe with special ingredients the family has used for generations.\r\n\r\nEvery day Hermenegildo gets up very early to prepare the vegetables, sauces and, of course, the tortillas; making every effort to please her customers.  Her husband, Crescencio, prepares the meat and they sell an average of two or three sheep's worth per week, depending on the season.  \"While I prepare the tacos my husband serves soft drinks.  For hygiene reasons, he also collects payment from the customers,\" she says.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to buy chilis, corn, napkins, plates, cups, firewood and soft drinks.  The earnings will be used to cover household expenses and to reinvest in raw materials and animals.  \"I am pleased with my business, my family and my school, since it is never too late to start.  Thank you for every opportunity you give us to grow.\"\r\n\r\n*The photo was taken at Guadalupe's house.  Hermenegilda is the one wearing a print blouse, red pants and holding her grandson."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1015.62,"image":{"id":1981518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy chilis, corn, napkins, plates, cups, firewood and soft drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tetela, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-09-24T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-24T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hermenegilda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yesenia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rufino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Constantina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.57},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.57},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.57},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":101.57},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.56},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.56},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.56},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.56},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.56},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.56},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.56},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.56},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":507.81,"local_amount":8437.5,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T17:59:11Z","rounded_local_amount":8446.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731204577},{"amount":507.81,"local_amount":8437.5,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":8446.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752292002}],"funded_date":"2015-09-24T18:36:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":951952,"name":"H\u1ea3i","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs H\u1ea3i is 36 years old and she is married.

Por las ma\u00f1anas, todos  los habitantes salen de sus hogares para ir a trabajar ya sea al campo ya sea al ingenio azucarero.  El ruido que produce el silbato dentro del complejo productor recuerda los cambios de turno que los obreros realizan. \n   En dicha comunidad se integr\u00f3 un grupo que lleva por nombre Felinas pues a sus miembros, mayormente mujeres, les encantas los gatos; actualmente est\u00e1 integrado por: Jessica quien vende dulces; Venancia, cosm\u00e9ticos y bordados artesanales; Alexis, ropa; Trinidad, lencer\u00eda; Mar\u00eda Luisa, tacos y Ma.

Dicho negocio es atendido por Mar\u00eda Luisa quien con gran dedicaci\u00f3n ofrece tacos de bistec, longaniza y carne de cerdo enchilada;  en una mesa al lado de la parrilla acomoda: los limones, la salsa, la sal, r\u00e1banos, pepinos y las indispensables tortillas.  \n   Ella comenta que  \u201clos tacos preferidos de mis clientes son los de tripa y bistec\u201d  y no es raro ya que todo mexicano siente un gusto especial por dicha comida.

In the morning all the residents leave their homes to go to work in the fields or at the sugar factory.  The sound of a whistle blowing in the manufacturing complex reminds workers of the change in shifts.\r\n\r\nFelinas is the name of a communal bank group made up mainly of women who like cats.  The current members are: Jessica who sells candy; Venancia who sells cosmetics and embroidered goods; Alexis who sells clothing; Trinidad who sells lingerie; Maria Luisa who sells tacos and Ma. Victoria who sells cosmetics.  Maria provides nursing services and Anayanci offers esthetician services.\r\n\r\nEvery weekend, starting at 6:00 p.m. one of the businesses starts on a small porch where there are five tables and a grill to make the best tacos in the area.  The business belongs to Maria Luisa who makes steak, sausage and pork tacos.  On a table next to the grill are limes, sauce, salt, radishes, cucumbers and the essential tortillas.\r\n\r\nShe says that \"the tacos preferred by her customers are the ones made of tripe and beeftsteak\" and this is not rare because all of Mexico has a special liking for this food.  Her income has allowed Licha, as she is known lovingly, to support her husband in the household expenses and to buy domestic appliances, especially a washing machine.   So, finally, she no longer has to wash everything by hand.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan was used to buy furniture for her shop.  Now she plans to buy meat, oil, chilis and tortillas because, fortunately, sales have increased.  \"Thanks to the support of my husband, my recipes and good customer service, the taco business continues to expand\" she says.\r\n\r\n*The photo was taken in the taco shop kitchen.

Locals and visitors meet to take part in cultural activities and the main street's parade of allegorical floats.  This is where a communal bank called Las Fresitas established itself.

Then I worked with the father of my children but later we divorced.  I kept the taco business which will be inherited by my children, and work as hard as I can every day for them\" says Brenda with pride.  \r\n\r\nNow she employs three people and her earnings have increased favorably, allowing her to add more ingredients to her tacos.

He is asking for a Kiva loan to buy an engine for a maize milling machine so that he can provide a milling service to 300 families in his community. The maize milling machine takes raw maize (corn) and creates a maize flour which is the staple food in Zambia. Most rural families in Kabwe District grow maize on their small farms and store it and use it as their primary supply of food for the year. After the kernels are removed from the cob, they then have to be milled to create flour, which can then be boiled to make what is locally called Nshima. <br \/><br \/>Rent-to-Own has done market research in Erasmus's community and has determined that the location for this equipment is great. The closest working maize mill is about 10 km away, This means most potential customers have to travel about 10 km, and since most will walk or use their bicycles to travel to the maize mill, it is certain they will prefer to use this maize mill rather than traveling a longer distance. Equipment such as a maize mill can be a major boost for many enterprising farmers such as Erasmus, as it allows for him to diversify his business. <br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, the upfront costs of such a maize mill are very prohibitive. With this loan, Erasmus will get an engine for a maize mill from Rent-to-Own, which will deliver the equipment, as well as provide training on how to use and maintain it. This loan will help Erasmus on the path to building up a viable business that can provide for his community throughout the year.

Many of the local people work every day in that factory to obtain the sweetener that later will be transported to all parts of the country.  In one of the quiet neighborhoods of the town the Matamoros group formed. The members of the group are: Narcisa and Ignacia, who sell soft drinks; Isidra, groceries; Isabel prepared food; Rosa, a taco stand: Mar\u00eda, purified water; Enedina, cosmetics and footwear from catalogues; and Antonio, who is a bricklayer. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Rosa Aurora is better known as Rosita because of her likeable, even humorous, character. She has always enjoyed being an important source of income in her household and for that reason three years ago she decided to open a taco business, thanks to the help provided to her by VisionFund Mexico. From that time, she has been giving full service from 6 am to 4 pm every day of the week. While she prepares the necessary ingredients, her husband sets up the tables and sets out all of the table-top items so that when the first client arrives, the delicious tacos will be ready.  \"Food sales is a very good business, especially for us, because Mexicans always crave a taco,\" she comments enthusiastically as she remembers what motivated her to start up this business venture. With a base in the success she has achieved, she has been able to employ another person, as well as take care of the household expenses, buy furniture for the living room, two beds and to save towards the purchase of a cargo truck she can use to begin another business activity.

sympathetic and happy guy. He is 30 years old. He is married and has two children. When he learnt that it was possible to get financial support, he turned to Arvand for the first time. Dilovar lives with his family in a rural village. He does not have higher education, as it was not possible for him to study at the university due to the family's financial difficulties. \r\n\r\nDilovar works as a vehicle repair man. His wife works as a nurse at the local hospital. In order to have an additional income for covering food expenses, Dilovar has his own business. He works with fattening and reselling cattle. \r\n\r\nCurrently Dilovar would like to increase the number of cattle to expand his business. Therefore he turned to Arvand and would like to get a loan to purchase cattle. He hopes very much for a positive result, and thanks Arvand in advance for the

She looks after the house and the children, and she sews women's clothing in parallel. She finds time to do everything. Sangina earns money and feeds her children while staying at home. She wants to expand her sewing business as a way to increase her daily income. To carry out this plan she needs a certain sum of money.

She has secondary education. As a source of income for her family, she works with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started this business 19 years ago with her own savings. Thanks to Kalyikan's persistent work, her farm has three cows and 13 sheep today. She grows alfalfa and wheat for selling on 3.04 hectares of own land. Combined, the business brings in an income of 17,000 som (KGS) per month. \r\n\r\nWith an aim to further develop her loan, Kalyikan turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 150,000 som (KGS) to purchase livestock to increase her herd.

She is divorced and has a school-age son. She has a secondary vocational education, and works in the district Architecture [office] as a principal specialist. She has also been rearing animals for ten years for income for her family, having started with 16,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Nazira's hard work, at the present time she has two cows and two horses. She sells milk on a daily basis. She also has a small garden where she grows vegetables for her own use. Her gross monthly income from the business and from her salary is about 17,800 som (KGS), but these funds are insufficient to support her family and raise her son. For this reason, in order to develop her business further Nazira has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 25,000 som (KGS) to buy a steer. She plans to invest the proceeds of the loan in the further expansion of her business and increasing her family's income, which will enable her to save up to build a barn for her livestock and for Nazira's son's education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":57.26,"image":{"id":1976319,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a steer in order to help bolster her income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tyup district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-09-24T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-24T20:20:03Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nazira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1989},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1828},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1881},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1936},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1992},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2051},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2110},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2172},{"due_date":"2016-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2235},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2300},{"due_date":"2016-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2368},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2138}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.84},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.42},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.22},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.04},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.88},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.76},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.65},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.58},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.52},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.5},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.52},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.84,"local_amount":1989,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-21T12:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2103.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730934430},{"amount":27.42,"local_amount":1828,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-19T13:11:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1932.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752026553}],"funded_date":"2015-09-25T04:25:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":951030,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria es de la ciudad de Villarrica, es ya una profesional, pero sigue estudiando una especializaci\u00f3n para poder procurarse una mejor vida.\nElla de aqu\u00ed a 4 a\u00f1os se ve como una Dra.

She and her husband have raised four children (two daughters and two sons); they are independent and live separately. Cholpon has a secondary education. She has been farming for 26 years. Her father-in-law gave her a cow with calf and ten sheep as starting capital. Cholpon and her husband have been able to develop their business. Today they have six cows and 13 sheep. They have their own garden where Cholpon grows vegetables and fruits for their own consumption. Her monthly income is 22,000 som (KGS). In order to develop her business further, Cholpon has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 140,000 som (KGS) to increase the size of her herd by buying some calves. Cholpon plans to invest the proceeds of the loan in growing her business further and improving her family's living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":153.35,"image":{"id":1976372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy additional calves in order to increase her herd.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Toktogul district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-09-24T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-24T20:40:03Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cholpon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":140000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6400},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":4334},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4456},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4583},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4713},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4846},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4983},{"due_date":"2016-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5270},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5419},{"due_date":"2016-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5573},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5731},{"due_date":"2016-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5893},{"due_date":"2016-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":6060},{"due_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6232},{"due_date":"2016-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6408},{"due_date":"2017-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6590},{"due_date":"2017-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6776},{"due_date":"2017-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":6968},{"due_date":"2017-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7166},{"due_date":"2017-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7369},{"due_date":"2017-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7578},{"due_date":"2017-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":7792},{"due_date":"2017-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":3735}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.43},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.47},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.23},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.19},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.21},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.29},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.41},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.61},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.87},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.19},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.57},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.03},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.54},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.14},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.8},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.54},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.37},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.27},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.26},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.31},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":153.35,"local_amount":10734,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-19T13:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":10809.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752026555}],"funded_date":"2015-10-23T03:10:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}}]}
