successfully repaid her previous loan, having used it as intended. She is extremely grateful to Kiva and everyone who contributed to her financing. Today she owns six cows and six sheep, and also grows wheat and barley on 9.60 hectares of land. The growth of her farm has allowed her monthly income to reach around 22,000 som (KGS).

Isaac has been running his money transfer business in one of the townships called Zingalume in Lusaka, Zambia since November, 2014. He is requesting for a loan in order to purchase the two trading kiosk which he is currently using and to provide the funds needed to serve customers. The loan will also be used to employ one person to help serve customers faster. <br \/><br \/>Access to financial services in Zambia is both scarce and expensive. Close to 10 million Zambians, do not have bank accounts. Distance and transportation factors hinder access to available financial services. Zoona is a company that specializes in low-cost mobile money and other financial transaction services by propagating an open network using small businesses called Agents. Isaac is one of the Agents, he earns a profit for every transaction that he makes at the kiosks. <br \/><br \/>This is his story: When Isaac first started his business his main focus was to get people in his community to know about the service that he provides. He started off by doing direct sales to customers in his community by distributing flyers and explaining his business to them in person. His strategy paid off because barely a month later his transactions had increased from a mere 10 transactions a day to 30 transactions a day. He then set up his second outlet and because of the quick growth of his business he faces the challenge of working float (electronic and cash value of his working capital) which means he does not have enough working capital to satisfy his customers from time to time. He frequently has to close his shops and make trips to the bank to convert his electronic money to cash and vice versa. <br \/><br \/>Isaac is certain that purchasing his trading kiosks so that he can own them and the capital injection in his business will help him grow his business and earn more profits. The profits will help him to provide basic needs for his family, as the business is his only source of income."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1953461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy two Zoona trading kiosks and provide financial services needed by the 10 million people in Zambia without bank accounts and to make jobs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Lusaka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2015-09-24T22:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-24T22:50:07Z","loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isaac ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":24560,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":24560}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-11T07:28:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":935415,"name":"Henry","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Henry is 27 years old and is one of two children in his family.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nVicross School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

The advantage of his business is that he can generate income. The disadvantage is the lack of money to buy tools. <br \/><br \/>His dream is to have his own home. He wants to buy tools such as: a drill, saws, sandpaper, and other things. This is the first loan sequence with the institution in three years that he has done this business. These are the reasons why Kenny requests a loan to buy tools for his carpenter's shop."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":35.82,"image":{"id":1983692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy tools for his carpenter's shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-09-25T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-25T04:50:01Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kenny Williams","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":238.77},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":282.57},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":289.26},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":292.52},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":313.98},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":330.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":335.02},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":358.34},{"due_date":"2016-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":368.64},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":384.85},{"due_date":"2016-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":402.89},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":402.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.82},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.38},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.39},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.1},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.65},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.25},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.75},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.3},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.73},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.43},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.82,"local_amount":238.77,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":247.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752077209}],"funded_date":"2015-09-26T10:42:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauren Potter","image":1606278}},{"id":952258,"name":"Fransiscar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fransiscar is a married woman.

Aigerim is one of those who desires to have a good one. She is happy to be a freshman at AUCA, but at the same time she is concerned about tuition fees. <br \/><br \/>There are five people in her family: her parents, herself and two younger sisters. Unfortunately, both her parents are unemployed due to their health problems. Looking for a bright future, her mother went to Moscow in 2013. After a year, she returned back sick and underwent surgery. Her father was an actor at a local Drama Theatre until he had an accident one day there. That day, he broke his leg during rehearsals, then had an operation, and from that day, he can\u2019t walk properly. Both parents get allowance from the state social fund.<br \/><br \/>The main source of funding is her relatives, who support them from time to time as they can. In addition to that, Aigerim and her younger sisters work as part-time waitresses in cafes in summer. Aigerim says that the lack of money never hinders her or sisters to go to school and study. Instead, it motivates them to strive more in their studies. It serves as a challenge for them to hurdle and conquer. It never discourages them, but it pushes them to dream to gain a degree in the university, to have a bright and promising future. Now she is knocking at Kiva lenders\u2019 hearts for a loan to pay for her university tuition fee. She assures you that every dime that you lend won\u2019t be wasted. Your loan is an ultimate hope for her to finish her studies, earn a degree at AUCA that will be a ticket to get a well-paid job, and enable her to help and alleviate her family\u2019s living."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1985134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for her higher education in the ICP Program at AUCA.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bishkek","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":326,"posted_date":"2015-09-25T06:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-25T06:10:05Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aigerim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":70,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-09-27T02:24:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":952256,"name":"Varduhi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This nice and cheerful lady\u2019s name is Varduhi and she is 35 years old.

Excellence in everything has always been its way of practice. Its community implements all the democratic values of a modern and developed society. All these circumstances attracted Elisa\u2019s attention to the university in the beginning, and now she enjoys a spirit of friendliness and collegiality that foster constructive discussion and exciting ideas among students.<br \/><br \/>Elisa was a diligent schoolgirl. Her parents always supported her in all her beginnings, but when she was admitted to AUCA and to Shanghai University in Great Britain, they asked her to stay with them as they were afraid that a UK education would cost much more than the best university in Central Asia. <br \/><br \/>Elisa has a very big family of 8: her parents, elder brother, herself, three younger sisters and a younger brother. Her elder brother graduated from the university this summer and is searching for a good job. Her three younger sisters are schoolgirls, and her youngest brother is only 4 years old. <br \/><br \/>Elisa\u2019s mother is a doctor by profession, but due to the help needed in the household for her children, she is a housewife. Of course, it\u2019s really hard for Elisa\u2019s father to make ends meet as he is the only bread-winner. He works as an employee of a local bank. His salary allows them to have a modest life and being an economist helps him to distribute his income evenly. <br \/><br \/>When Elisa entered AUCA, her father continued to support her idea and began to search for funding. He analyzed local banks\u2019 loans and came to the conclusion that he couldn't get them as they have high rate fees. Elisa applied for AUCA financial aid and her family was so happy to learn about the interest-free Kiva loan for AUCA students. Another reason which made them doubly happy was that they could repay it after Elisa\u2019s graduation.<br \/><br \/>Elisa thanks Kiva lenders for their consideration of her profile and she will try to exceed lenders\u2019 and her parents\u2019 expectations."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1985187,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for her Bachelor Degree at AUCA","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bishkek","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":326,"posted_date":"2015-09-25T09:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-25T09:20:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":70,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-09-28T18:45:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sally Otway","image":1443524}},{"id":952319,"name":"Waeni","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Waeni is a married woman with 3 children.

With this investment, he will stay ahead of the rise in demand for the coming season and he will support his goal of having more financial liquidity to improve his quality of life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":35.16,"image":{"id":1983708,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy leather and materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-09-25T10:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-25T10:30:02Z","loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oscar Manuel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104190},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119316},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122895},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":126582},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130379},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134291},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138320},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142469},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146743},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151146},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155680},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160350},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165161},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170116},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175219},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180476},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":185890},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":191467},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197211},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":203127},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209221},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215497},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221962},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":252292}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.27},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.48},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.32},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.68},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.08},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.53},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.01},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.54},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.12},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.74},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.42},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.14},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.91},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.74},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.62},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.56},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.56},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.61},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.91},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":35.16,"local_amount":104190,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:24:39Z","rounded_local_amount":104958.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752082861}],"funded_date":"2015-10-23T07:41:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":951084,"name":"Olga Elvira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Olga de 44 a\u00f1os de edad, quien tiene 32 a\u00f1os de residir en vivienda propia junto con un hijo de 23 a\u00f1os y una hija de 20 a\u00f1os de edad.

affordable, payment plan. When deciding on this purchase, Bounpone and his group, along with other villagers, participated in a village meeting where they discussed the costs of treating local water supplies.

Most of the locals work in fishing or other sea-related jobs. The town is home to 24-year-old Ingrid, who is married with two children of 7 and 3, the older one of whom goes to school. Her husband is a fisherman. Wanting to earn her own income and be able to help with the cost of her children's education, she has been selling clothing and Yanbal and Belcorps products (beauty products, cosmetics, perfume and women's accessories) for more than 7 years. She does this door-to-door, during her free time,and also sells her goods from her home to the clients she knows best. She leaves her goods on credit and collects payments weekly. She always takes advantage of special offers as she buys quite big quantities and then she sells her goods at the normal price, which earns her a good income.

He is a refugee and lives with his parents in IDP settlement. The main source of income for family is raising and selling seasonal vegetables (cucumber, onion, greens and etc.). This brings him 180ZN monthly but he also gets additional earning working as a laborer at his free time. Raising vegetables is very popular in Azerbaijan because people have high demand for fresh vegetables.

The majority of them are married and they are happy that their children are in school, already preparing for their own future!<br \/><br \/>40-year-old Isabel is a member of the Trust Bank who was able to study until the ninth grade. She has been a member of Friendship Bridge through three loan cycles. Isabel has a small store in a room of her home where she sells chicken meat, beans, rice, and vegetables. She is eager to secure an additional loan so that she can buy more chicken to sell, a larger quantity and variety of vegetables, several large sacks of rice and beans, and other supplies that her customers are requesting. She works hard at the store and as her husband works far from home, takes care of their three children. <br \/><br \/>Isabel and her friends in the Trust Bank have been empowered by the monthly educational trainings that they receive from a Friendship Bridge Facilitator. After transacting business on their loans, the ladies learn how to more effectively manage their small businesses (budgeting, accounting, marketing, pricing, customer service). <br \/><br \/>It would be impossible for the ladies to walk into a bank in Guatemala to secure a loan. Kiva investors, partnering with Friendship Bridge, fill an important role in the lives of these hard-working women.

and live in Soroca. Four years ago they wanted to help their son, who was working in Ireland, return home and open his own business. Using her own savings and the money earned by her son abroad, Galina rented a place for cows. They invested more than $20,000 in the repair and improvement of this place. At the present time there are 26 dairy cows and 12 horned livestock on Galina's farm. All the family takes part in this business, including the son, having returned from abroad. They have rented 70 hectares of land to support the livestock. The farm needs a water supply since now the farm is supplied with water from a tractor with a cistern. This transporting of water requires large monthly expenditures, and so she wants to connect to a [permanent] water supply. Galina needs a loan and so she has applied for help to Kiva. This money will help her to increase the size of her herd and create new jobs."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1986866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to connect her farm to a water supply.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MD","country":"Moldova","town":"Soroca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":413,"posted_date":"2015-09-25T17:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-25T17:40:07Z","loan_amount":2525,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Galina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MDL","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2017-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2017-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2017-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2017-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2017-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2017-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2017-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2017-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2017-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2017-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.21},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.2},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.2},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.2},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.2},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-09-26T08:08:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":952522,"name":"Wilmer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wilmer is a married man and he is the father of one kid.
