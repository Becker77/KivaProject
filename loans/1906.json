Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":83.34,"image":{"id":1985948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy pesticides and seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"Chappagaun","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2015-09-25T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-25T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ananta Kumari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:50:17Z","rounded_local_amount":4280.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731158931},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":4166.67,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4280.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752246646}],"funded_date":"2015-09-25T22:00:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":952446,"name":"James","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"James is married and has three children.

On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about 50 U.S. cents. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction and as fuel for fires, and which can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will pay for itself many times over."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":58.34,"image":{"id":1986009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy feed and medicines.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2015-09-25T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-25T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sunita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2916.67},{"due_date":"2016-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2916.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2916.67,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T16:50:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3082.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731158933},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":2916.67,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T18:04:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3082.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752246652}],"funded_date":"2015-09-26T01:16:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tony Gooch","image":970369}},{"id":952807,"name":"Narine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Narine, 54, lives in Vanadzor, a city in the Lori region.

A year ago, faced with the need to generate additional income to support her household expenses, she decided to start a business decorating special parties. She grew up with links to the events business, because her father has a company producing musical events. This made her develop her taste for decoration and creativity. She thinks this business has a very important potential, because people look for complete experience in their parties which includes decoration for each occasion, and which they do not master. Thus, she works decorating houses for different events, such as New Year parties, birthdays (with special decorations according to the birthday age they are celebrating), wedding anniversaries, among other events. Wendy does not have the required furniture and accessories to carry out her job; therefore, she has to spend money in rental expenses for each event.

To offer the best to his family, he had to take up jobs working in the fields and fishing, but he decided to start with the sale of slushies 15 years ago.  \r\n\r\nThis job is done by obtaining frost from a block of ice, which is subsequently covered with various sweet syrups, and combinations of flavors can also be made.  The slab of ice slab is placed on a table and the flavoring in glass jars and to the side disposable materials to serve each customer.\r\n\r\nThe success achieved is considerable and with the profits made he bought a tricycle with which he travels through the streets of the community offering his tasty product, \"I like to walk the streets to meet the tastes of my clients and best of all to have some income which will cover the costs at home \"he said. \r\n\r\nAmong the fresh and delicious flavors offered are coconut, pineapple, strawberry, peanut, grape, chocolate, walnut, tamarind, eggnog, lemon, yellow cherry, currant, vanilla, strawberry with milk and coffee.\r\n\r\nJose's goal is to establish an ice-pop store where he would offer new products taking advantage of the high temperatures of the region.

Elizabeth is a 35 year old woman who lives with her partner. She has 5 children who are 4, 8, 10, 14, and 16 years old and her business is selling groceries. <br \/>She is a good mother, constant and very hardworking. She runs her business in the Carmen IV neighborhood, which is known for hosting the survivors of a river flooding that happened some years ago, and which today has become a thriving manufacturing zone.<br \/>Elizabeth is a brunette, of short stature, and physically robust. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed and she speaks Spanish. (In the photo, she is the first on the right, in a red top.) She shares her life with her partner, who works, and with their children, who are in school. They live in their own home, which is made of brick and has all the basic services. The need to improve her business took her to the enterprise bank where there are businesses such as: selling food, selling natural medicines, selling second-hand clothing, making sheets, selling fruit, running a greengrocery, and selling fast food. Her business is a grocery store and she sells drinks, snacks, haberdashery, and other very variable goods. \"Everyday I need to resupply my store\" she says. <br \/>The advantage of her business is that there isn't local competition. The disadvantage is the lack of money to resupply the business.<br \/>Her dream is to have a well-stocked store. She wants to invest in her grocery store, stocking it with all types of products. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 2 years that she has been running her business. <br \/> It is for these reasons that Elizabeth is requesting a loan to supply her store with all types of goods for feeding a

dedican a trabajar en el campo ya que la fertilidad de la tierra es aprovechada al m\u00e1ximo. Por otro lado, la mayor del a\u00f1o el clima de la regi\u00f3n es muy caluroso por lo que no es raro ver a las familias acudir a los r\u00edos de la comunidad para poder refrescarse y pasar gratos momentos. Los r\u00edos m\u00e1s concurridos son los que se conocen como \u201cel nacimiento\u201d, \u201cla palma\u201d, \u201cAmap\u00e1\u201d y el arroyo de Cosolapa.\n    En dicho municipio se form\u00f3 un grupo llamado Las Rebeldes ya que un esp\u00edritu rebelde es aquel que luchas por sus sue\u00f1os a pesar de las adversidades. Los integrantes son: Ver\u00f3nica quien se dedica a vender comida t\u00edpica; Paulina, verdura y material reciclable; Maricela, verdura; Petra, cr\u00eda de cerdos; Roberta y Laura, refrescos; Mar\u00eda Irene, zapatos; Filomena, comida; Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas, trastes y Guadalupe, tamales. \n   Ver\u00f3nica es una de las integrantes m\u00e1s alegres del grupo a quien todos conocen simplemente como Vero.  Desde que era una ni\u00f1a ayudaba a sus padres en el negocio familiar, pero \u00e9stos le llamaban la atenci\u00f3n pues cada que sal\u00eda a entregar un pedido, regresaba a su casa con un nido de palomas, con los huevos o, incluso, con las peque\u00f1as aves. No obstante, su motivaci\u00f3n principal siempre ha sido su madre quien desde hace treinta a\u00f1os se ha dedicado a vender comida t\u00edpica en la calle principal del municipio. Por tal motivo, tiene diez a\u00f1os elaborando las recetas de su mam\u00e1 y todos los clientes saben que si quieren encontrar una saz\u00f3n y una atenci\u00f3n \u00fanicas deben acudir a su negocio.\n   Las ganancias obtenidas le son de utilidad para aportar con el gasto de la casa, cubrir en tiempo y forma el pr\u00e9stamo y reinvertir en su actividad. En esta ocasi\u00f3n invertir\u00e1 el cr\u00e9dito en la compra de chile, cebolla, aguacate, crema, frijol, aceite, tortillas, queso, servilletas, palillos, carne y gas. \n*En la fotograf\u00eda, Vero viste playera blanca y short azul. \n","en":"There is a Oaxacan city where the majority of the inhabitants work in the fields, where the earth's fertility is maximized. On the other hand, during the majority of the year the climate of the region is very hot, so that it is not uncommon to see the families turn to the community's rivers to cool off and have some enjoyable moments. The most crowded rivers are \"El Nacimiento,\" \"La Palma,\" \"Amapa,\" and the Cosolapa stream.<br \/><br \/>In this municipality a group called \"Las Rebeldes\" (The Rebels) was formed, since a rebellious spirit is that which fights for one's dreams in spite of adversity. The members are: Veronica, who works selling typical foods; Paulina, vegetables and recyclables; Maricela, vegetables, Petra, hog raising; Roberta and Laura, sodas; Maria Irene, shoes; Filomena, food; Maria de Jesus, dishes; and Guadalupe, tamales.<br \/><br \/>Veronica is one of the happiest members of the group, whom everyone knows simply as Vero. Since she was a girl she helped her parents in their family business. But, they had to reprimand her because every time she went out to deliver an order, she would return with a nest of doves, with the eggs, or even with the small birds. Nevertheless, her main motivation has always been her mother, who worked selling typical food for the last thirty years in the streets of the city. For this reason, she has been preparing her mother's recipes for ten years and all her clients know if the want to find flavor and top-notch service will look to her business.<br \/><br \/>The earnings obtained are useful to her for contributing to her home expenses, covering with time the loan, and reinvesting it in her business activities. This time she will invest the credit in the purchase of peppers, onions, cream, beans, oil, tortillas, cheese, napkins, straws, meat, and natural gas.<br \/><br \/>*In the photo, Vero is wearing a

The majority of the inhabitants work in the fields and others have their businesses of food, juices, tire repair, public bathrooms, and more, located on the edge of the highway to satisfy travelers' needs. <br \/><br \/>In this community, a group was formed called Alcatraces due to the pleasure of the members in this flower. They are: Lidia, who works selling costume jewelry; Mar\u00eda, Calixta and Irma, traditional food; Zobeida, raising pigs; Margarita and Paula, groceries; Eufrosina, roast chicken; and Lucia, clothing.<br \/><br \/>Irma is a very hard-working woman who had to take care of her 3 children alone. For them, she decided to begin selling traditional food three years ago. At the beginning, she only had a traditional grill called an \"anafre\", three small tables and a tarp with which she would protect her business from the elements. However, her routine has expanded since now she has been contracted to make the lunches for students and teachers in a school store. Once finished with this work, she goes to her primary business and serves her customers until eleven at night. <br \/><br \/>The earnings gotten and the support of her mother have allowed her to offer her children an education in addition to purchasing furniture for her home. In the same way, she has invested in her business since she purchased a stall to store her business's materials.   <br \/><br \/>At this time, the loan will be invested in the purchase of corn, oil, cheese, cream, vegetables, meat, soft drinks and gas since the sales continue increasing due to her great service and quality. She says, \"Thank you for the opportunities that you are offering us with another loan, and to change our lives in a positive way.\"<br \/><br \/>The Alcatraces group is grateful to everyone who has made this new opportunity possible to get this support to enrich their work. <br \/><br \/>*The photo was taken in front of Mari's house.

Subsequently, the profits she obtained permitted her to begin selling women's clothing and articles of costume jewelry. The profits that resulted from the aforementioned activities are reflected in the household appliances that she was able to acquire recently. In order to be able to satisfy her clients, Carmen travels to the city of Puebla to buy footwear and clothing.\r\nShe invested the previous loan in buying footwear. On this occasion, she will purchase school shoes and blouses that her clients have requested from her.
