Its income will continually sustain their everyday needs and educational expenses of their children. <br \/><br \/>Charlyn and her husband, Jonar, aspire to buy a delivery truck for easy access to buyers and suppliers.

His wife passed on a few years back, and he not only takes care of his children but also has to take care of his three young grandchildren and sick elderly sister who is 75 years old. <br \/><br \/>Ramaqele lives in a modern hut although it is not well ventilated, nor does it warm up well in winter. He works many hours to ensure there is enough food for his entire family. Some of his family go school and only help his elderly sister work in the field on Saturdays and Sundays to make a bit extra for the family. He and his eldest daughters have to wake up very early, between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m., during the week to start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water and warming the house for all the children before they go to school. <br \/><br \/>Collecting firewood, setting up the fire and doing the actual cooking demands a lot of time. Temperatures in the Lesotho highlands are never really high; winters can get very cold and often people often have to start the fire inside their huts. Starting a fire releases smog and smoke which when inhaled in large quantities over a period of time can lead to lung diseases, eye problems and in the worst case to death. In these circumstances, life for people like Ramaqele has been very difficult. <br \/><br \/>Ramaqele has requested a loan from Kiva lenders, in order to be able to purchase clean cook stoves which provide him and 12 other people from his village, who are living in similar circumstances, the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families and that does not require a lot of fuel, which is hard to find in Lesotho, nor expensive paraffin and gas. This stove can be started with the use of very little, readily available biomass like dry twigs and dry cow dung that do not require a long time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the homes. <br \/><br \/>This stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery which runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones and a mini LED lamp. This is a life-improving package for these people. This stove saves them time to be with their family, saves energy, eliminates the element of toxic inhalation, house burning and has given them the freedom to have a better-lit home to see better in the evening while cooking. It also enables children to do their homework.

subscription. They can pay per hour or per minute of internet rental and they can still connect with their social network. Shiela, 30 years old, knows this need. <br \/><br \/>That\u2019s why she decided to put up an internet caf\u00e9 beside her house in Polomolok, South Cotabato. She can help those students who need to research their school assignments, those families with members abroad who long to see each other through Skype, and also those bored individuals who want to play online games. <br \/><br \/>But no matter how in demand Shiela\u2019s business is, she will also experience loss if she does not give importance to its maintenance. As of now, some of her CPUs are deteriorating and she has to upgrade them. She will also buy an additional computer so she can cater to more internet users. <br \/><br \/>She needs PHP 15,000 for this purpose. A new computer and upgraded units will ensure a more efficient business operation, thus giving her steady income to support her family\u2019s needs and children\u2019s educational expenses. <br \/><br \/>Shiela is married to Arman, a welder. They help each other in providing for their two small children. It\u2019s their desire to see them finish their schooling and acquire stable jobs someday.<br \/><br \/>Shiela is a compliant member of CCT Credit Cooperative and meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to inspire and strengthen each other through the Word of God. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":94.82,"image":{"id":1986777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to procure an additional computer and pay for the upgrading of old units.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Polomolok, South Cotabato","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.221944 125.060278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-09-27T03:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-27T03:50:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shiela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":40.65,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-17T13:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1905.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":730955711},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2540.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045613}],"funded_date":"2015-09-29T21:27:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":953270,"name":"Huch","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A local resident living in a wooden house located in Kampong Cham province, Huch is a 60-year-old and she has eight children.

She is well-known in the neighborhood where she lives, in the south of the municipality. She is the mother of two children. Because of the need to generate income for the household expenses, she decided to start a business in her house. For 25 years she has sold pork on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. The people in the area have a tradition of including it in their diet. They also enjoy a good piece of chicharron with bread, foods made from chopped pork, sausages and cold cuts made from pork and seasoned with salt and spices, rice with pork, and other foods that are typical of the region. The consumption of pork has increased, due to new information about the benefits of eating this meat and the proteins it provides. Because of this, Tania is requesting her first Kiva loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo so that she can invest in a larger amount of pork and cover the existing demand.

To improve the competitiveness of her store, she ventures into buying and selling of diesel and gasoline. The nearest gasoline station in their area is several kilometers away. Many vehicle owners and PUV (public utility vehicle) drivers find it impractical to drive that far just to refill their gas tank. Thus Carmelita thought of a way to earn higher profit while helping the drivers. She buys gallons of diesel and gasoline then retails it per liter. It brings positive impact to her business and continuously sustains her and her grandchildren\u2019s needs.<br \/><br \/>Carmelita is a widow who takes care of her grandchildren while her children are working abroad. She knows that work abroad is just temporary, so she still tries to improve her business. She aspires to have additional capital amounting to PHP 20,000 to buy more supplies for her store such as grocery items, beverages and rice. She will also allot supplementary capital for buying and selling of diesel and gasoline. Your kind generosity will surely be a great blessing to her.<br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She successfully revived her variety store business. Little by little, she resumed the buying and selling of usual commodities like toiletries, canned goods, snacks items, and beverages. Similarly, her husband, Larry, continues to make a living with his job as an electrician. Their two children are already working as of now.<br \/><br \/>Delia wants to develop her business further to attain her dream of renovating their house. She wants to make it sturdy and secure to prepare for typhoons and other calamities. <br \/><br \/>She has applied for a PHP 30,000 loan to buy additional dry goods, grocery items, and cases of beverages.

Later on, she decided to accept typing jobs as she is also adept at it. Then, she started selling coffee and snack items to clients who were waiting for the finished documents. Indeed, she really knows how to gauge the needs of customers and she is willing to go the extra mile to meet them. \r\n\r\nHernila is a widow who has been exploring many ways in order to support the needs and education of her children. Now, her youngest son is already in college. Two to three years from now, she will be relieved of huge educational expenses and she can focus on improving her business further. For the time being, she is requesting supplementary capital of PHP 25,000 to pay for the maintenance of the Xerox machine. She also plans to sell office supplies and she needs a display cabinet for these. This additional capital will surely boost her income and savings.\r\n\r\nHernila is a devoted member of CCT Credit Cooperative and she regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The President of Pades Duteraninkunga (standing above the kneeling group), Claudette is 41 years old and married with five children aged 9-19. For the past five years, Claudette has formulated a local milk drink, which she sells to her community. While Claudette sells the beverage at the market, she also delivers to neighbors and receives them in her home. All of Claudette's business is run out of her home, which limits the amount of space for her family of seven. <br \/><br \/>While her beverage is enjoyed throughout the community, Claudette would like to expand her inventory and market. In order to do so, she has requested this loan from Kiva through Vision Finance Company to purchase a large quantity of sorghum and a cow so that she can reduce the cost to make her locally-beloved beverage. With the extra income, she hopes this loan will improve her family's status and will allow her to purchase medical insurance for her family.

One of the group\u2019s members is Patience. She is a 30-year-old vibrant business woman. \r\n\r\nPatience is a cross-border trader to South Africa. She started her business in 2014. Her motivation to start cross-border trading came out of the need to help her husband fend for their three children. Her husband is a jeweller, but due to the harsh economic environment his business is not bringing in the expected profit. Her situation was further worsened when her child was involved in a tragic accident and they needed funds for health care. In the midst of all this, Patience refused to give up. In order to get back on her feet, Patience and her friends sought help at Thrive Microfinance. The group came to Thrive in August 2015. The ladies are committed to growing their businesses and to be able to change their lifestyle. \r\n\r\nWith a loan from Thrive, Patience hopes to resume her cross-border trading. She also hopes to open a flea market business where she can cater to a larger customer base.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term, as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

He solely provides for himself so he works hard each day to support his daily needs and business expenses.<br \/><br \/>Jesus owns a variety store, and drives his tricycle once in a while to add to his income. He believes that managing his own business will help him focus on improving his life rather than thinking about the challenges he is currently facing. Jesus has some health issues like arthritis and kidney problems, but his circumstance haven't broken the strong-willed man in him. He is determined to make good use of his time as he wants to serve his neighbors by supplying more items needed in his shop. He also plans to start up his projects for fishing and farming businesses. He knows this will make a great impact not only on his life but likewise on the community where he lives.<br \/><br \/>Jesus lacks enough capital to make this happen so he is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan which he will use for the said purpose.

Since her husband\u2019s income is unstable and it usually cannot suffice for their everyday expenses and children\u2019s education, Jocelyn decided to embark on direct selling of home and personal care products. She chose this business because it typically requires low capital to begin with. Then she enhances it by expanding her network of target consumers. Not only this, she started to build a pigpen just recently because she has a plan to buy piglets that she can raise very soon. She tries her best to enhance her family\u2019s financial resources in order to support the needs of her children and push through their college education until its completion. <br \/><br \/>Now Jocelyn aspires to improve her business with the aid of additional capital amounting to PHP 18,000. She will use it to buy more personal and home care products that she can sell to her friends, neighbors and other network. She will also start her hog-raising venture with one to two piglets and a few sacks of feed. She\u2019s positive that this additional capital will boost her income and savings. <br \/><br \/>Her dream is to have a stable business so she can buy a four-wheel vehicle someday. She also desires a good future for her children and harmonious relationship among her family. She meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Elizabeth is a small-scale farmer who lives in the remote village of Kwanza in the Kitale area of Kenya. She is happily married and is blessed with seven lovely angelic-looking children. <br \/><br \/>For the last 20 years, Elizabeth has been engaged in mixed farming and has never looked back. She really likes what she does. Her primary sources of income have been sales of milk, eggs and crops as well as some personal business in which she engages to make ends meet. Elizabeth finds farming very fulfilling and agrees with the notion that farming is a very profitable business venture. However, she constantly faces the challenge of poor productivity on her farm owing to a lack of farm inputs. <br \/><br \/>She is seeking a loan to buy farm inputs such as quality seeds and fertilizer that will increase her production levels, which will immediately translate into increased income levels. Elizabeth is a very hard-working woman who believes that, through hard work and honest sweat, her living conditions will permanently change. <br \/><br \/>She will use the extra income she will receive to repay the loan and improve her farming business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":8.54,"image":{"id":1979285,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase farm inputs such as quality seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-09-28T11:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-28T11:20:03Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":707.73},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":728.41},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":749.7},{"due_date":"2016-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":771.6},{"due_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":794.16},{"due_date":"2016-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":817.37},{"due_date":"2016-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":841.26},{"due_date":"2016-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":865.84},{"due_date":"2016-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":891.15},{"due_date":"2016-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":917.19},{"due_date":"2016-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":944},{"due_date":"2016-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":971.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":7.72},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7.94},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.17},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.41},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.66},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.91},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.17},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.44},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":8.54,"local_amount":853.87,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:30:00Z","rounded_local_amount":901.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112610}],"funded_date":"2015-09-28T12:11:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}}]}
