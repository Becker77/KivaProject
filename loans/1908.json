The whole family\u2019s concerted efforts are geared towards their dream of enjoying a more comfortable life someday. <br \/> <br \/>Lenita aspires to improve her boarding house by replacing some worn out roofing and enclosing some open spaces to adapt in this rainy season. She will buy galvanized iron sheets, ply boards, and other construction materials. She is requesting a PHP 29,000 loan for this purpose. Part of it will be allotted for additional sacks of livestock feed that she can sell. <br \/><br \/>Lenita is committed to CCT Credit Cooperative\u2019s vision to alleviate poverty and she regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

All of them belong to the Miskita ethnic group, from the town of Bilwi in the municipality of Puerto Cabezas. They are enterprising women who work hard every day to make their small businesses grow. They organized themselves as a communal bank eight months ago, to access loans with a solidarity guarantee through Pana Pana. They decided to name their communal bank \"Cumadura,\" which means \"Rainbow\" in the Miskito language. <br \/><br \/>Rosalia is a member of the communal bank. She is a friendly 34-year-old woman, married with three children: two adolescents who are in grade school and a little one-year-old daughter. Her husband works in an informal manner as a traditional fisherman. With the aim of contributing to the household expenses and having her own source of income, she sells used clothing at a stand she maintains at one of the municipal markets of Puerto Cabezas. She is requesting a loan to buy a package of mixed used clothing in Managua, so she can sell it at affordable prices to her customers in Bilwi. She dreams of having enough capital to open a butcher shop."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":542.08,"image":{"id":1985817,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy a package of mixed used clothing in Managua.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Bilwi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":328,"posted_date":"2015-09-28T19:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-28T19:00:04Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hipolita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pastora Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shorlina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":17400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1450},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1450},{"due_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1450},{"due_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1450},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1450},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1450},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1450},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1450},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1450},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1450},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1450},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":325.22,"local_amount":8705.83,"processed_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-10-23T12:12:16Z","rounded_local_amount":8963.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":731158444},{"amount":216.86,"local_amount":5805.06,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-18T13:14:49Z","rounded_local_amount":5976.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752246152}],"funded_date":"2015-09-29T03:51:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":954062,"name":"Asma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asma is a responsible mother of five children.

In the same way, a streambed of crystalline waters whose bottom was of white chalk gave the impetus to name the zone \"White Pass\".<br \/><br \/>In one of the neighborhoods of this community, a group was formed called Confeti in order to solicit loans from VF Mexico to invest in their activities.  The members of the group are Nancy, who sells shoes and tamales; Maria S., Laura and Norma, cosmetics; Jonathan and Nancy, food; Zuri, articles of silver and gold; Maria F., cakes; and Norma, clothing.<br \/><br \/>Nancy lives married to Luis and together they have spawned three children who study in the community school.  With the firm goal of supporting her husband with the household expenses and motivated by her parents, she started with the sale of tamales of different flavors such as ranch-style, corn, cookie, and those called \"little dog's heads\".  The production consists of preparing the leaves, cleaning the product, kneading the dough, making the sauces, and cooking the meat.  <br \/>   <br \/>The earnings from the food allowed her to start the catalog sales of shoes.  Well, her friendly character made it so that the customers showed up easily.  She says, \"My family is my primary motivator, to see my children happy fills me with satisfaction and encourages me to forge ahead.\"<br \/>   <br \/>On this occasion, she will invest the loan in the purchase of shoes for school since the students of the community need this product.  \"I would like to start with the sale of articles of silver and gold to increase my earnings,\" she adds.<br \/><br \/>The Confeti Group is grateful for the loans offered to its members and for affording them a new opportunity to grow in each one of their activities.<br \/><br \/>*The photograph was taken on the porch of Nancy's house.

He is a married man with one wife and four children.\r\nMr. Jackson sells purified honey as his major source of income to meet all his household needs. He buys raw honey from upcountry cheaply and he purifies it, stores it in buckets then packs it into containers of different sizes and prices. From assessment and the evidence he earns a profit of more than a half of the cost of the raw honey. \r\nHowever his major hindrance is the long time and energy spent during purification and packaging. He has therefore applied for a loan of 4,000,000 (Four Million Ugandan Shillings) to buy a simple honey purifier which will help him to quicken the process. This will help him to process more honey in a shorter time and also allow him time to engage in extra income generating activities. He is hard working and resilient.

c\u00f3mo los periodistas locales nombraron como \u201cla novia del sol\u201d a su ciudad natal. Para ellos, el clima caluroso durante todo el a\u00f1o se debe al amor que tiene el sol por su tierra. Por tal motivo, las familias acuden a balnearios o r\u00edos y otros m\u00e1s compran su propia alberca para poder refrescarse de manera recreativa.\n   En una de las colonias de dicha comunidad se integr\u00f3 un grupo llamado Casa de Dios cuyo nombre obedece a la fe que tienen sus miembros los cuales son: Guadalupe quien vende abarrotes; Benita, cosm\u00e9ticos, art\u00edculos de plata y tamales; Alida, zapatos, ropa y plata; Ruth, plata y cr\u00eda de cerdos; Blanca L., est\u00e9tica; Aracely, ropa; Jos\u00e9, fotograf\u00eda; Odilia, cosm\u00e9ticos y comida t\u00edpica; Jos\u00e9 Antonio y Josu\u00e9, tacos y Blanca, zapatos.\n   Jos\u00e9 Antonio es conocido por todos como To\u00f1o y por ser un padre ejemplar que ha cuidado solo de sus dos hijos.

For them, the warm climate throughout the year is due to the love that the sun has for their land. For this reason, families go to seaside resorts or rivers and others buy their own pool to be able to cool recreationally.<br \/><br \/>In one of the colonies of that community, a group called \"Casa de Dios\" [House of God] was formed, whose name is due to the faith their members have, which are Guadalupe, who sells groceries; Benita, cosmetics, silverware, and tamales; Alida, shoes, clothes, and silver; Ruth, silver and pig farming; Blanca L., aesthetics; Aracely, clothing; Jos\u00e9, photography; Odilia, cosmetics and traditional food; Jos\u00e9 Antonio and Josu\u00e9, tacos, and Blanca, shoes.<br \/><br \/>Jos\u00e9 Antonio is known by all as To\u00f1o and for being an exemplary father who has taken care of his two children by himself. To offer them a better quality of life, he decided to start his own business four years ago. In selling tacos, he found the best opportunity to achieve his goals. Also, he teamed up with his nephew and together they have managed to enrich the taco stand to such a degree that after selling only 150 tacos a day, today they sell on average 400 to 500.<br \/><br \/>Proceeds earned have helped him, in addition to cover the family expenses, to buy two motorcycles, a pickup truck, and open another taco stand located in a strategic point of the town. Moreover, one of his greatest dreams is to \"achieve a taco franchise in such a way that is an asset to my family,\" and adds, \"Thanks for each loan.
