Good health is what she prays for so that she\u2019ll be able to run the business for her family. <br \/><br \/>She\u2019s earning about PHP 12,000 every month and is thankful to God for being blessed with having her own business to manage.<br \/><br \/>Like other entrepreneurs, Josephine aspires to have added designs of footwear to sell so that customers will have a variety of choices.

Since then it has become the most common and cheapest form of public transportation.\r\n\r\nA regular and proper maintenance of her vehicle is necessary to ensure efficient performance and steady income. In view of this, Concepcion is humbly requesting for a Php 19000 loan to pay for spare parts like tires and regular maintenance to avoid breakdown. She hopes for a positive response on her request. This will assure her of a regular earnings to support their daily personal and household needs. \r\n\r\nConcepcion hopes to save up enough money so can start her dream, a mini-store. She also prays for abundance in their lives and for her children to finish their studies.

She thanks you for your support. Dairy cows are an important source of nutrition and income in Nepal. Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks.

She lives with her partner and has four children, aged 4, 6, 10 and 15. Her business is selling soft drinks and bread. <br \/><br \/>She is a good mother, independent and very dependable. She carries out her business in Cotoca, a rural zone which serves as a collection point for agricultural products which are then distributed to the markets in the city. <br \/><br \/>Mariloida is of mixed ethnic heritage, short in stature and with a robust build. (She is seated at center in the photo, wearing red shorts.) Her native language is Guaran\u00ed, and she also speaks Spanish. She shares her life with her partner, who works the land, and with her children who are in school. They live in a house built of wood which has only electrical services. The need to improve her business in order to help her family led her to form a communal bank with people who have businesses such as a locksmith's workshop, seed sales, food sales, leather handicrafts, woven hat production, cleaning services and a neighborhood store. <br \/><br \/>Her business is selling soft drinks and bread. She sells them on a street corner, starting very early in the morning. The warm climate of the area helps with the sale of cold drinks. \"They deliver fresh bread to me in the morning and in the afternoon,\" she comments.

It is a frozen treat just like an ice cream, but it is more affordable and easier to prepare. Its basic ingredients are water, milk and sugar. The mixture is combined with any flavor like chocolate for chocolate ice candy, buko (or young coconut) for buko ice candy, banana, mango, melon, jackfruit, and many other flavors. Then it is set to freeze in a narrow plastic wrapper called ice candy wrapper. The end product is quite refreshing during the dry season with hot weather. \r\n\r\nMarilyn, 46 years old, from Santa Barbara, Iloilo, chose to venture into ice candy making 10 years ago. She took advantage of the good supply of fruits in their place and made it into delicious ice candy. She was able to improve her business, and now she is supplying many stores and street vendors. Ice candy vendors are commonly seen with portable coolers, roving in different communities, either urban or rural. \r\n\r\nMarilyn would like to buy another freezer and high volume of ingredients for ice candy making. She appeals for a PHP 25,000 loan for this purpose. Additional income that will be derived from this investment will continuously provide for her family\u2019s daily needs and college expenses of her children.\r\n\r\nMarilyn is married to Rafael, who has a \"buy and sell\" business.

This is their first loan cycle with the institution in the two years that it has been offering the service. <br \/><br \/>For these reasons, Vivian is requesting a loan to buy flour to bake cakes and pastries."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":753.55,"image":{"id":1986606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy flour in bulk to bake cakes and pastries.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-09-29T21:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-29T21:50:02Z","loan_amount":3275,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vivian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marideisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benigno","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fernanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vicenta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":22500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1694.65},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1725.5},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1756.9},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1788.88},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1821.43},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1854.58},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1888.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1922.69},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1957.69},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1993.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2029.6},{"due_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2066.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.66},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":251.16},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":255.73},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":260.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":265.12},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":269.94},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":274.86},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":279.86},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":284.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":290.14},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.42},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":753.55,"local_amount":5177.05,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":5199.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752077220}],"funded_date":"2015-10-02T20:16:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary-Ann Gallagher","image":null}},{"id":954751,"name":"Jennifer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Of her ten years in the food vending business in Pasay City, Jennifer has already encountered a lot of ups and downs in the business world that made her a better person today.

Twenty years in the tailoring business, she encountered many ups and downs, and many times she did think of giving up; yet she never gets tired of the business she started. <br \/><br \/>It was in the year 2005 that Zenaida became part of CCT. This is also one of the reasons that she considers why she strives to push forward. With the help of CCT, together with Kiva, she was able to acquire loans that really helped her improve her business. <br \/><br \/>This time, Zenaida needs more supplies of tailoring materials like needles, fabrics, and thread, but she doesn\u2019t have enough resources to buy them. She also wants to have another sewing machine, but she doesn't have enough funds. So, she wants to request help from you.
