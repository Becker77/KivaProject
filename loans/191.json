She discovered the world of photography while a college student in San Jose, California: \u201cRight away, I knew photography was absolutely my passion, my talent, and my greatest ambition.\u201d As a Saudi Arabian woman attending a predominantly Latino university, her love for photography grew alongside her love for Latino culture. She was struck by the many similarities between Latino families and Saudi families: love of family, food, ritual, and celebration.\n \nAfter graduating from college, Tasneem pursued a career in photography. In 2008 she opened her own photo studio, Foto Clara, and quickly developed a client base within the Latino community she had connected with as a student. \u201cA lot of photographers miss the point of taking family pictures. They work too much with Photoshop and lose what it is that\u2019s special about the family.\u201d\n\nWhile Tasneem\u2019s portfolio of work continues to grow, she still runs her business out of her apartment, relying on her trusty old camera and a temperamental computer. In need of a loan, Tasneem approached her own bank but was turned down because she only began a credit history when she came to the U.S. for college. A $6,000 loan will allow Tasneem to purchase a new camera, a new laptop computer, and new photo editing and business accounting software. \u201cI see so much potential to grow a business here,

Olmos, ubicado una hora y media al norte de Chiclayo.\n\nDesde hace dos a\u00f1os es propietaria de un peque\u00f1o negocio que brinda servicio de fotocopias, tipeos en computadora, impresiones y venta de art\u00edculos escolares. Su establecimiento se encuentra ubicado frente a un colegio estatal del distrito por lo que resulta de mucha ayuda a los estudiantes de la zona. Con el dinero que percibe de este negocio ayuda al sostenimiento de su hogar.\n\nLa constante demanda de los estudiantes por su servicio hace que constante mente tenga que renovar el material que necesita para trabajar con los tipeos, copias e impresiones (hojas bond, tinta, toner, etc). Comprar estos productos por unidad le resulta muy caro y poco rentable para su negocio, por lo que se encuentra solicitando por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 700 nuevos soles para invertirlos en la compra al por mayor de estos productos y de esa manera tener un stock permanente con el cual pueda seguir trabajando.\n\nSu sue\u00f1o es estudiar la carrera de psicolog\u00eda en una universidad de la regi\u00f3n y brindar este servicio en su distrito. Ella es una joven trabajadora, alegre y responsable.\n","en":"Deysi is 18 years old, single, and lives with her parents in the Olmos district, located an hour and a half north of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>\r\nFor two years, she has had a small shop that offers photocopying, typing, and printing services and sells school supplies. Her business is located across from a high school, which means there are many students nearby. The money from her business helps to sustain her household.\r\n<p>\r\nThe great number of students that frequent her shop means that she constantly needs to replenish the supplies needed for her photocopying, typing, and printing services (bond paper, ink, toner, etc.). Buying these items individually is very expensive and not lucrative for her business, so Deysi is seeking her first loan from Edpyme Alternativa. She will invest the 700 Peruvian nuevos soles requested in the purchase of wholesale items, and in this way she will be able to maintain a permanent stock of products for her business. \r\n<p>\r\nDeysi's dream is to study at a local university to become a psychologist and to bring this service to her district. She is a hardworking, happy, and responsible young woman.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kris Vickery, Kiva

Veronika needs a loan of WST $3000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Veronika joined SPBD.  This is her 5th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Veronika's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Veronika L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.6 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

Like many little boys dream, Tony wanted to be a race car driver. Instead, he joined the military to defend his country and pursued a career in aviation. Tony was a crew chief in the Air Force for four years. He took advantage of all the Air Force had to offer and teach him. Now a veteran of aviation, he currently works as a helicopter inspector. With the support of his wife and family, he decided to also pursue his dream of being the first African-American supercar manufacturer.\r\n\r\nWhen Tony\u2019s 6\u2019 6\u201d body could not fit in the traditional supercars, he built his own in 1990. Tony says, \u201cIf one door closes I just look for another opening; I don\u2019t give up.\u201d  With much patience and hard work he continues to expand his business and hopes to make it a full-time job. With his ACCION USA microloan he has hired two designers to work with him part-time and has purchased a laptop. He is proud to set an example of entrepreneurship for his four children and is determined to continue fulfilling his vision.\r\n\r\n<b>About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA<\/b>\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about how the new caf\u00e9 on your corner and the delivery service that brings the fresh baked goods acquired the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated 10 million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis.\u201d Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education. \r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild the economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since

Pandan, Bogo City, Cebu. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: General (Sari-sari) store and Tricycle business. Her husband Artemio P., who is 51 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 5 children who are 15 to 25 years old. Rowena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rowena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 5th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000 which she intends to use to purchase more stocks for the general store so that she could continue to save up for the education of her children. Rowena P. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. About NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Nigora is 29 years old. She is divorced and has no children. Nigora has a tailoring business at a tailoring shop. Her business is sewing national women's dresses. Her workmanship is very good and, being young, she has a good eye for design.\r\n\r\nShe is very organized and has a good head for business. She has had this business for 12 years and this is her second loan from IMON International. With her loan, Nigora will buy more material for sewing dresses.\r\n\r\nNigora smiles when asked what her dreams are for the future. She quickly replies that she plans to open a workshop, hire seamstresses and expand her business. With her spirit, she will surely succeed.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

A. is a 28-year old married woman who supports her family by operating two business ventures: motorcycle transport (habal-habal) and rice dealing businesses. She lives in Purok 4, Brgy. Bongalonan, Basay, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her motorcycle transport (habal-habal) and rice dealing businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 6,500 PHP. Jocelyn is now borrowing 15,000 PHP so that she can continue to fund the operations of her motorcycle transport business. This will be her fourth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 5,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Jocelyn aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has run her pig farm for a while, however high cost for feeds and piglets makes it impossible for her to expand her business.  She understands that pig farm can be promising financially.  The profit from the difference of selling revenue and daily cost and additional revenue stream from selling excrement as fertilizer is quite promising.  This increases her motivation to expand her farm and increase her pigs.  With additinal funding and training from DINARI, Ni Made S. can add 2 more pigs to her farm so she can have 3 pigs at a time. Piglets costs her $33 each and feeds supply for 4 months costs her $55,so she can earn $100 per 4 month periods.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is 42-year-old Justina M. from Mwanza. She is married with seven children between the ages of 15 and 24.\n\nJustina has been running a shop since 2003. She sells tea, Blands, sugar, soap and cooking oil. She works at the business for twelve hours per day, six days per week and currently earns about $198 from her business.\n\nJustina is requesting a loan of $250in order to purchase soap, cooking oil, sugar and wheat flour. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Justina thanks you for your support!\n\n\nABOUT SELFINA: \nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":318029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase soap, cooking oil, sugar and wheat flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-13T15:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":36711.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010846},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":36711.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233132},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:56Z","rounded_local_amount":36711.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664923},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:47Z","rounded_local_amount":36711.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105635},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:27:40Z","rounded_local_amount":36711.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022745},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":36711.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867985},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":36711.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757186},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":36711.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146298},{"amount":27.76,"local_amount":33333.36,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":36711.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984460}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T03:37:55Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":111815,"name":"Florenda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florenda T. is from the city of Dapitan City.

Jantianon, Amlan, Negros Oriental. She earns her living with her general store and pig fattening.\r\n\r\nMerly's 38 year-old husband, Allan, is a driver and they have three children who are between 13-16 years old. The children go to school and also help their parents in the businesses as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nMerly joined Kiva partner NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income through a general store and a pig fattening business. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 25,500 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nMerly is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 30,000 was used to fund the operations of her general store and the pig fattening business.  The loan had a positive impact for both the businesses and the family living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 13th cycle loan in the amount of Php 29,500 which she plans to use for both businesses. Merly is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the poverty alleviation program, NWTF is empowering women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of the community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":542309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

For four years she has run a general store and book store from her home.  This business gives her a great deal of satisfaction since it is the main source of income for her family.  Since the beginning, she tried to see that the store was well-stocked.  She acquires at wholesale stationery supplies and adornments and articles for the home.  Sometimes she doesn't have the product a customer wants, and she loses the customer; therefore, she wishes to add to her inventory with this loan.  In the future, she wants to improve her store by installing a roof and by offering a wider variety of food and other items, so that her customers can buy what they need.  This is her tenth loan from MFP.  She promises to make timely payments because she is very responsible and because she doesn't want to disappoint her work group, which has placed much faith in her.  With this loan, she plans on purchasing a greater quantity of school supplies for this year.  Classes have already begun, and she needs to stock up on this merchandise.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jeff Schell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":585040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy school supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-18T20:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":152.91},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":157.29},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":163.86},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":169.02},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":175.61},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":181.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.99},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.44},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.39},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.85},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.34,"local_amount":152.91,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":160.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887498},{"amount":58.99,"local_amount":157.29,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:44Z","rounded_local_amount":165.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154500},{"amount":61.44,"local_amount":163.86,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":172.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449810},{"amount":63.39,"local_amount":169.02,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":177.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588507},{"amount":65.85,"local_amount":175.61,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":184.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725016},{"amount":67.99,"local_amount":181.31,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":190.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463101}],"funded_date":"2010-08-18T23:25:37Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Schell","image":null}},{"id":227386,"name":"Nhan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nhan T.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Kanoti and two other promoters in his community - Francis and Lucia - need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Kanoti wants to be a promoter because he believes that the chlorine dispenser will make water safe for use.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink.

She's looking for a loan from Ceprodel to get the money she needs to cover the debt and gain the benefits of being able to light her house at night.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\nEl trabajo de agricultura requiere de mucho esfuerzo  por la exposici\u00f3n al sol y el desgaste f\u00edsico que este trabajo provoca.

Para suplir esta necesidad, solicita que le implementen un panel solar en su hogar y al obtenerlo se ve en la obligaci\u00f3n de pagar este panel.

B. lives in the region of Rudaki. He is 34 years old, married and has 2 children. Sheraly graduated from high school; he does not work anywhere. The only source of income for his family is an animal rearing business, which works out well in the rural area. Sheraly has a small cow barn where he grows calfs for sale. He purchases young animals on local markets, takes care of them for about 40-45 days, when animals get bigger he sells them on the same markets. Now is the season of animal trading, therefore the client needs additional help. He needs additional money, and this is why he came to us in order to obtain a loan. Additional resources will help him not only to purchase more animals, but also to receive profit, which he needs. This will help his family to have a little bit of a better life. The client plans to repay the loan within 12 months. <p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva volunteer.<b><p>\u0411\u043e\u0431\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043b\u043e\u0432

Enterprising Women.  They are from the La Conquista settlement within the La Lomita neighborhood. <p>\r\n\r\nThese women, along with the other ladies who make up the group, comprise part of a faction of people denominated as \u201cwithout roofs\u201d.  These people have nowhere to live (neither a house or land) and, together with hundreds of other people in the same situation, joined together to fight for their rights.  Today, they live in a settlement which they created a year ago which the government subsequently bought to be able to build them homes so they could live there legally. <p>\r\n\r\nIn this settlement live several families looking to get ahead.  The women play an important role since, in many cases, they are the head of household.  It\u2019s in this way that 15 women from the settlement gathered together to form the group called La Esperanza (which means \u201chope\u201d).  They carry out a variety of activities:  the sale of garlic, medicinal herbs, food sales, some have stores, others sell blankets, sheets, clothing, toys, housewares, cleaning products, etc. <p>\r\n\r\nGiven that the settlement is in a remote area, they must travel to get to the nearest clinics.  It\u2019s for this reason that Marta decided to take courses in medicine and it is she who gives injections, takes blood pressure readings and provides immediate medical care for those who need it. <p>\r\n\r\nIt is a very unified group and the women, in addition to dedicating themselves to their particular activities, also carry out extra tasks to earn more funds to help improve the neighborhood. <p>\r\n\r\nToday they need a loan to invest in their businesses, especially to buy merchandise to offer for sale.   <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nEste Comit\u00e9 se formo gracias a la se\u00f1oras Lucia G. y Marta Dom\u00ednguez, quienes llamaron a la fundaci\u00f3n interesadas en el programa Comit\u00e9 de Mujeres Emprendedoras, ellas son del Asentamiento \u201cLa Conquista\u201d del  Barrio \u201cLa Lomita\u201d.<p>\r\n\r\nEstas se\u00f1oras, al igual que las dem\u00e1s mujeres que comprende este comit\u00e9, forman parte de un grupo de gente denominado \u201csin techo\u201d. Estas personas no pose\u00edan un lugar (ni casa ni tierra) donde vivir, y que unidos entre cientos de personas en igual situaci\u00f3n, lucharon por su derecho y hoy d\u00eda viven en un asentamiento que tomaron juntos el a\u00f1o pasado y que posteriormente el estado adquiri\u00f3 compro para poder construirles casas para que vivan ah\u00ed de forma legal.<p>\r\n\r\nEn ese asentamientos existen varias familias que tambi\u00e9n buscan su progreso, las mujeres cumplen roles importantes pues son, en la mayor\u00eda de los casos, cabeza de familia. Es as\u00ed como 15 mujeres de este asentamiento se unieron y formaron un comit\u00e9 que llamado \u201cLa Esperanza\u201d. Ellas realizan distintos tipos de actividades entre ellas: venta de ajo, hierbas medicinales, venta de comidas, otras tienen despensas, otras poseen mercer\u00edas en donde venden colchas, sabanas, ropas, juguetes, art\u00edculos para el hogar, productos de limpieza, etc.<p>\r\n\r\nDebido que el asentamiento queda en un lugar retirado, ellas deben viajar hasta los puestos de salud m\u00e1s cercanos, es por eso que Marta, decidi\u00f3 hacer cursos de enfermer\u00eda y ella es quien aplica inyecciones, hace nebulizaciones para ni\u00f1os, toma de presi\u00f3n y primeros auxilios para todas las personas que necesiten.<p>\r\n\r\nEs un grupo muy unido, ellas adem\u00e1s de dedicarse a sus actividades particulares, tambi\u00e9n realizan actividades extras con el fin de obtener fondos para realizar mejoras en el barrio.<p>\r\n\r\nHoy ellas necesitan de un cr\u00e9dito que podr\u00e1n invertirlo en sus negocios, especialmente comprando mercader\u00edas para vender.<p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":186165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of clothing such as socks, gloves, hats, scarves, etc.  Those who sell food, to purchase items such as fruits and vegetables, dairy products, meats, flour, oil, noodles and frozen items.

She says prices of commodities have increased and for that reason she is not able to buy more stock from the market, making it difficult to make profit to expand the business. She buys her stock of goods from the city center of Accra and retails them at the community market where she lives. <P>\r\n\r\nEvelyn is requesting a loan to augment her working capital to buy more stocks of aluminum buckets and plastic materials to sell.

She is 29 years old, married to Mr. Yoshihiro T. of Japan (a government employee), and blessed with one infant-aged child. She is a resident of P1 Garang, Tangub City. Even though she received a monthly allowance from her husband, Arlyn still had a passion for business. At present, she has a sari-sari store with an average net income of 1,500 PHP per month, and has two single-seat motorcabs for hire that bring in an average income of 240 PHP daily. These earnings are so helpful in supporting her family. Arlyn joined Kiva partner, PMPC, in 2009. She was given the privilege of borrowing 25,000 PHP as her first loan, which was used to purchase a single motorcab for hire. This time, she is requesting a loan of 12,000 PHP to add to her capital for her sari-sari store. The future income from this loan will be used to make her loan repayments and also as savings for future use. She is hoping that someday her business will become more progressive.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About PMPC<\/b><br>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She owns a business venture, providing suit-making services and doing 'elei' prinitng (on cloth) for local community members.  Makerita  has many years of experience in this business.  Makerita  needs a loan of WST 1000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials & some paints for making the 'elei'.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Makerita  joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Makerita's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

In the urban setting, eggs are a protein food that is very affordable for the majority of people in the community, and for this reason he believes that it is a profitable business.\r\n\r\nHis main aim in the future is to grow his business and have a better standard of living.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":609857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more eggs to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Narok","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 36.866667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":133,"posted_date":"2010-09-30T02:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacob Saulo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:59:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177439549},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":3333.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:42:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3369.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182578845},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":3332.99,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:50:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188714081},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:21:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191452479},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:59:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195874600},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:27:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201315694},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206184945},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":3333.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-18T07:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211698384},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":3333.36,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-17T08:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":3368.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216787938}],"funded_date":"2010-09-30T18:27:57Z","paid_date":"2011-07-17T08:00:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":239699,"name":"Rolando","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rolando L. is from the village of Brgy.

The most difficult have been the problem of paying for her house rent and building a house of her own.  She plans to invest this loan in frying akra beans, gateau, sales of row food stuff, purchase of sugar, palm oil, groundnut oil, salt, flour and some plates. She believes the business will succeed because she has been in the business for a long time. She also thinks her approach to her customers will be captivating and hence lead to the success of her business. The loan will help her community because they will be able to afford at least three meals per day at affordable prices.\r\n\r\nAlice will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to pay her house rent and save for rainy days. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

She is 36 years old. Mary Jane is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Mary Jane owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling canned goods, junk foods, breads, biscuits, shampoo, soap & beverages in the local community. Mary Jane has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Mary Jane joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mary Jane has successfully repaid a previous loan of 17,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Mary Jane is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional canned goods, junk foods & beverages. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Mary Jane from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She lives with her partner Julian who is 29 years old and Ezequiel, their school-aged child who is 5 years old. They live in the town of Sirenachayocc where they have their own house. What they most want is to provide their son with a comfortable environment. Sarita emphasizes that everything she obtains is through her tenacity and devotion to her cocoa, coffee and sesame crops. It is for this reason that she tries to give her crops the best possible care and under this premise many of her buyers have been satisfied by the quality of her agricultural products. Nevertheless, she strives to do her best every day and devotes a good amount of time to her crops. She does this with the help of her partner. However, at harvest time she has to hire labourers to speed up the harvesting process in their daily efforts to obtain a good income. With the requested loan, Sarita will buy more cocoa plants and hopes to graft them as they grow. Her future plan is to invest her income in other businesses such as guinea pig breeding. This will be her first loan and she is very happy to know that she will have financial support. She is willing to comply promptly with her repayment schedule. With the loan she will acquire cocoa plants to expand her crops and obtain higher revenues later.\n\n.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":865734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cocoa plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-12T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":250.2},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":266.09},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":272.45},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":284.94},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":292.62},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":303.21},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":317.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":325.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":338.27},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":349.21}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.74},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.57},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.89},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.48},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.3},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.36},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.41},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.04},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":93.29,"local_amount":254.44,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:06Z","rounded_local_amount":254.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851287},{"amount":96.02,"local_amount":261.85,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":261.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666470},{"amount":101.45,"local_amount":276.67,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:42Z","rounded_local_amount":276.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621623},{"amount":102.92,"local_amount":280.72,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:18Z","rounded_local_amount":280.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835705},{"amount":107.3,"local_amount":292.62,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":292.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245466},{"amount":111.17,"local_amount":303.21,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:41Z","rounded_local_amount":303.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385514},{"amount":246.58,"local_amount":672.5,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:35Z","rounded_local_amount":672.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712819},{"amount":114.92,"local_amount":313.43,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:33Z","rounded_local_amount":313.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283201933},{"amount":126.35,"local_amount":344.56,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:48:13Z","rounded_local_amount":344.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097708}],"funded_date":"2011-09-16T21:11:53Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T09:48:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":338061,"name":"Joyce","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce is 62 years old.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Flora is very proud to have responsible and hard-working children who have finished their studies and become successful in their chosen career.  She believes that having them reach their goals in life is the fruit of her sacrifices. <P>\r\n\r\nFlora is engaged in a welding and repair shop business.  Through her income from her shop, she was also able to put up a sari-sari store (community-based store).  She is doing her best to improve her businesses and as much as possible without depending too much on her children because she believes they will also have their own families in the future and it is good for them to start saving money.

Mrs. Maricruz has two children; her daughter works in her neighbourhood selling bread, and her son lives in another city. On Mondays, the Manantiales group sells fruit at a fair, where group members also sell lunch, dinner and second-hand children's clothing. Everyone in the group lives near the fairground. The group has established a base of regular customers, but they know that marketplace competition is stiff. In order to succeed, they need more merchandise, a bigger, better work area, and the necessary credit to make these improvements. They hope to increase their income and improve their families' quality of life. This will be the Manantiales group's third loan; they have always demonstrated determination, honesty, and unity-- all the qualities essential to group solidarity. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She would also like to buy tables, chairs, plates, glasses, and cups to establish her business and make her customers more comfortable. \r\n\r\nPersonally, she feels more independent and responsible with her monthly payments and she knows how to make her own decisions. \r\n\r\nDiana Maria would like to express her gratitude to Manuela Ramos for allowing her to grow as a woman and entrepreneur. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Brittany Thatcher, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":288877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase rice, sugar, oils, napkins, tables, chairs, plates, glasses, and cups","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn - San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-03-20T15:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":133.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":133.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:16:02Z","rounded_local_amount":145.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27111836},{"amount":45.94,"local_amount":133.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":146.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36007029},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":145.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590703},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":133.32,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:25:33Z","rounded_local_amount":145.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52984965},{"amount":45.95,"local_amount":133.68,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:16:50Z","rounded_local_amount":146.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205328},{"amount":45.73,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:48:04Z","rounded_local_amount":145.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73634603}],"funded_date":"2009-03-20T17:03:02Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T18:48:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brittany Thatcher","image":null}},{"id":99575,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace is 39 years old and married with no child.

She mostly sells fried peanuts and chips. Helen is happily married to Eduardo T.. The couple is thankful because they are blessed with two children. There is Edwin, who is 24 years old and a college graduate. He now works as an Overseas Foreign Worker (OFW). They also have Joel, who is 20 years old. He is currently in his second year in college and is studying Hotel and Restaurant Management. \r\n<p>\r\nAside from snack vending, Helen sells frozen foods and makes native cakes to help generate more profit to meet her children\u2019s needs. In the future, she hopes to have a permanent vending stall, which would make selling easier and generate more customers. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, Helen does not have enough capital to expand her business. She is therefore requesting a loan amounting to PHP8,000.00 to further achieve her business goals. With the loan she will purchase additional items to sell. She prays to God to give her strength in order to become a successful entrepreneur and to provide a better living for her family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":318134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

M., pictured second from the right and dressed in white, is the group coordinator for her 5-member group called \"Trabajadores Unidos\", which means \"United Workers\". She is the single mother of three children: a daughter of 22, and two boys ages 18, and 10. They reside in Paraiso Escondido, a small town in the sector of Punta de Villa Mella, in Santo Domingo Norte. Her daughter began studying law last year, her oldest son is a sophomore in high school, and her youngest son is a talented baseball player.\r\n\r\nHer home, along with her previous business, a general store in her home, was swept away when a river flooded near her house last year, taking four other houses with it. As a result, her two oldest children had to stop going school to meet their basic needs. She is starting over now by opening up a similar store from her home, selling general care products and basic medicines.\r\n\r\nGregoria plans to invest in such products as hair-smoothing cream, deodorants, shampoos, medicines, and sandals, which she buys in bulk and says are the products in highest demand. The home she is living in now, Gregoria says, is located in a very strategic business location relative to her town. At the end of this loan, she hopes her store will be firmly reestablished, providing her once more with a steady source of income. With this steady income, she hopes to start saving for her daughter's education, and to be able to pay for her sons' schooling and for the baseball coaching and cleats for her youngest son. She also plans to continue working on finishing her current home, as she has placed 800 out of 1,300 cinder blocks for it so far. Since her business is run from her home, having it completed would allow her business to expand.\r\n\r\nSome of her long-term goals are to be able to pay for her daughter's law school education, and also to be able to continue to encourage and support her youngest son, as they hope he makes it to the big leagues.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1400,"image":{"id":347306,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She tells us that now she lives with her parents and two of her brothers.  Ever since she left school she started to work, but since her community is small there are not a lot of job opportunities so she decided to start her own business selling pork meat.  She makes her sales on Wednesdays, but the day before she offers her meat to her friends and neighbors in the community.  The next day, after seasoning the pork, she delivers her orders. \r\n\r\nShe tells us that selling pork is a difficult and arduous business because days before she has to go out to the other towns to buy the pig that she will prepare, and at times it is very difficult to find a pig and she has to go very far from Playa V..  But she is a very tenacious woman, since she has to support her family and also her youngest brother, who has a hurt leg.\r\n\r\nAmada needs this loan to invest in the purchase of pigs, feed and plastic bags to make her sales.

brewed hibiscus flowers, organic blue agave nectar, natural extracts and spices. \r\n\r\nHusband and wife team Esailama and Tyrone were first introduced by Abdoulaye \u201cPapa\u201d Camara, a native from Senegal and one of the founders of the Sengalese National Dance Company. Esailama explains that their mom and pop company is a perfect marriage of her business administration background and her husband\u2019s entrepreneurial skill (he has had a successful line of oils, incense, and shampoos as an herbalist for over a decade). Camara introduced Esailama, a dancer, and Tyrone, a drummer, and was a mainstay in their lives and the New Orleans cultural community for many years. Camara was stranded for many days after Katrina and died from complications caused by cancer not long after being evacuated and returning to his native Senegal. The couple sees their company as part of a cultural and vocational heritage he bequeathed to them. Six years after Katrina, some of Tyrone\u2019s family are still displaced. Esailama explains that the company melds together family traditions and culture, and their product includes spices that have been passed down in the family for many generations.  \r\n\r\n\u201cBissap\u201d is a West African word for \u201chibiscus.\u201d In many cultures globally, the hibiscus is valued for its medicinal properties. High in antioxidants and vitamin C, the Bissap Breeze product can be used as a tea, in cooking, or as a cocktail mix. The company launched its first product sales of Bissap Breeze at the French Market during Jazz Fest weekend earlier this year, and the company has rapidly expanded. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of each bottle are used to support the performing arts and ensure that the cultural legacy of dance and music live on in New Orleans.  \r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan will be used to purchase organic agave, the most expensive ingredient in the product, as well as for marketing expenses and working capital.  \u201cWe\u2019re not just out to make a product,\u201d says Esailama, \u201cbut to us this is about creating something that is life-giving.\"

When she began, she sold sweets that she made herself, as well as towels. Later, she secured a place to sell in the area near the Market of Grenada.

She is a farmer in the village of Hetin Sota in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 River and is a member of the group GF Djidjoho of Hetin Sota, situated near the hot springs of Dangbo. She also sells rice. <P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work as farmers when the river level is low. Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc which are staple foods in Benin. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing their land. <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Sidonie H. has requested a loan of 120,000 F CFA which will allow her to farm about 1.5 hectares, growing some of the aforementioned crops.\r\n\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":237937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"cultivating 1.5 hectares in corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-12T21:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sidonie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821568},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:29Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357837},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046887},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938505},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396170},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:43Z","rounded_local_amount":32250.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904048},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:02Z","rounded_local_amount":16125.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126056}],"funded_date":"2008-12-12T22:54:50Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T10:26:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83207,"name":"Fouvale","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fouvale F., 25, is married with 1 child.

She lives with her only daughter, 17, who is studying for a technical career.   She set up a small store in her house where she sells basic foods (eggs, noodles, rice, milk, and bread, etc.) and drinks.  She has been doing this for a period of nine months.  She works in the store all day every day.  What she likes about the business is that through the business she gets to connect with a lot of people, and she wins many customers due to her good attention.  Also, she feels useful.  Being the only store in the region, it is very profitable.  She has also been selling beauty products for the past six months.  \r\n\r\nIn the future Adela would like to build a place for a mini market, which would help her neighbors with their daily purchases.  Her region is very far from the market.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  What she likes most about working with her communal bank is that all of the members support each other.

She is not married because her fianc\u00e9 became sick and died before their wedding, leaving her pregnant with their baby. Even though she must support her five-year-old daughter alone, she is determined to provide a good future for her child. \r\n<p>\r\nLeft alone to fend for her baby girl, Gena decided to establish her own business with the help of start-up capital from her mother so that she could support her young daughter and herself. As she moved on with her life, the pain of losing her child's father lessened, especially as she busied herself with building her general store and raising her daughter.\r\n<p>\r\nAs her business slowly grew, Gena saw new opportunities for expansion. In 2006 she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon so that she could add to her capital and expand her business. The loans she received from NWTF-Project Dungganon enabled her to diversify into food vending, including selling frozen food in her general store. The business now earns an average monthly income of 10,000 PHP, which she uses for household expenses and in savings for her daughter's future. The rest she plows back into the business.\r\n<p>\r\nIn her eighth loan cycle she borrowed 19,500 PHP to add to her revolving working capital. She was able to pay back the weekly installments on time and in full within the loan term. Now Gena is requesting a loan of 21,000 PHP for her ninth cycle. With it she intends to increase her inventory a little more so that she can build her savings for the future security of her small family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through its alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a dollar a day to achieving realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live lives that they can finally call honorable ones. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":395704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is 40 years old. Evangeline is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Evangeline operates a family member's service-based business providing manicure and pedicure services in the local community. Evangeline has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Evangeline joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Evangeline is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This will be the first loan taken out by Evangeline from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":472797,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

For five years, he has been engaged in the making and sale of chicha (a traditional drink of Peru).  He tells us that he learned how to make this drink from his parents since he helped them with this business when he was young.  Now, he is preparing his own chicha and selling it to his own customers.  He uses the income that he gets from this business for his personal expenses and to support his family.\r\n<p>\r\nChicha is a traditional drink of the entire country.  It is made from a variety of corn and a great deal is consumed by people who live in rural areas since it gives them energy needed to continue working.\r\n<p>\r\nJos\u00e9 wants to expand his business by purchasing raw materials used to make his product, especially firewood and charcoal (chicha is prepared in kitchens using firewood and charcoal) since, due to the spring rainy season, charcoal and firewood have become scarce.  This is why he is applying for the first time for a loan of 1000 new soles from Edpyme Alternativa.  He wants to use the loan to reach his objective.  Jos\u00e9 is a very hard working and optimistic young man.  His greatest wishes are to continue growing as a businessman and to support his parents when they need him.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Richard Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":500120,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"The purchase of raw materials for making chicha","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"La Union -
