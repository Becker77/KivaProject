He is a Palestinian refugee who works hard to improve and develop his family's living. Salah was working in a hospital when he decided to start his own business because his family's needs were increasing and the limited monthly salary wasn't enough to cover these increasing needs. Because Palestinians have limited access to the working sector, he decided to work as a taxi driver in 2011 providing transportation services to nearby villagers, students and employees.

Nowadays, he is facing problems due to the lack of available funds -- he wants to increase his inventory of mobile accessories, which are very famous and costly nowadays. He just started this business and does not have more cash in hand to purchase the desired inventories. This is the reason Nasren contacted Kiva's field partner, BRAC Pakistan, and requested a loan for her son. With the help of the loan, he can easily purchase mobiles accessories and extra recharge from various networks. In this way, he can easily attract more customers and can generate more income to cherish his family. Nasren is very thankful to lenders who take an active part in loan raising.

It is the most fertile area in the country. In one of the towns in the state, a number of people got together to form a group which was given the name La Misi\u00f3n to reflect the members' aim of doing their best for their families. The members of the group are: Magdalena, Guillermina, Martha and Blanca who sell food; Mar\u00eda de Lourdes and Marisol, cosmetics; Juliana, clothing; Juana, fruit and vegetables; Elizandra, shoes, lingerie and cosmetics; Asunci\u00f3n, groceries and sewing; Santa, jewellery and bags and Flor, shoes and cosmetics. Mar\u00eda Lourdes is a very enterprising woman who has been given the pet name Lul\u00fa by her friends and family. With the sole objective of providing better opportunities for her 3 children, she decided to start selling cosmetics through the catalogue of a prestigious brand. Thanks to her hard work, she progressed from a small trader to the leader of a group in which she is responsible for 23 saleswomen. However, she takes advantage of any opportunity to sell her product as she knows that the highest profits don't come happen automatically but have to be looked for. She comments, happily, \"I'll continue inviting more female entrepreneurs who want to earn their own incomes\". The most obvious sign of her business's success is that, previously, she walked around in the streets to sell her goods whereas she now does it from a car which she bought with some of her earnings and support from VF M\u00e9xico. She used her previous loan to buy lipsticks, eyeliners, mascara, talcum powder, deodorants and body lotions and she will use this loan to buy creams, lotions, lipsticks, eyeliners and eye shadows which her customers have asked for. All the members of the group are grateful to VF M\u00e9xico and KIVA for the loans which have enabled them to develop their businesses considerably. *The photo was taken outside Magdalena's house.

Her husband's shop is situated under the garments market and there is a lot of competitors in the market. Due to this competition, it is very difficult to convince customers to pay a high price. This competition becomes the cause for low sales and more efforts as well. Her husband has to maintain the latest designs, rates and delightful colors of garments for the shop so that he can maintain the rate of sales. Now the major problem is that the winter season is about to start and he does not have sufficient cash on hand to buy garments related to the winter season. If he cannot replace the summer season's stuff with winter season's garments, it might highly affect his sales. He does not want to reduce his sales and his monthly income. Therefore, Zahida has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner, BRAC Pakistan, so that her husband can be empowered to buy winter season's garments. Zahida hopes that her husband will purchase inventories according to his desire at the right time so he can cope with the market competition and could grow his income as well.

This business stems from the need to help her husband with the household expenses and provide the best possible for her daughters. <br \/><br \/>The profits from these three years allowed her to establish her business in a shop beside her house which allows her to dedicate more time to her family. \"I am happy so my family is happy. And this motivates me to continue with my business\", She commented with satisfaction. Besides selling clothing she makes cakes, jelly, flan and all kinds of dessert. One of her goals is to open a pastry shop. <br \/><br \/>At this time she will buy blouses, skirts, dresses and pants with the loan to continue with her growth. <br \/><br \/>The photograph was taken on Nadia's patio. Vianey is wearing a brown and white blouse and blue shorts."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":1986687,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy blouses, skirts, dresses and pants for women.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Colonia Infonavit, Tierra Blanca, ver","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-09-30T17:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-30T17:00:02Z","loan_amount":3375,"lender_count":94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vianey ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nadia Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Rocio ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carol Ann ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samantha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Perla Jazmin ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De La Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":57000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":4750},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":281.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":281.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":281.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":281.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":281.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":281.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":281.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":281.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":281.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":281.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":19000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":19010.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752292020}],"funded_date":"2015-10-22T21:16:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"leonardo","image":1277720}},{"id":953367,"name":"Miujiza Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Yvonne est commer\u00e7ante, membre du groupe de cr\u00e9dits \u00abMiujiza\u00bb, cliente de l\u2019IMF Hekima,  mari\u00e9e, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 36 ans, m\u00e8re de 7 enfants dont 3 \u00e9tudient et 4 n\u2019\u00e9tudient pas.

She is requesting a FUSAI loan to buy galvanized metal sheets, wood, nails and wires to improve the remaining walls and move her house to her own land. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":41.41,"image":{"id":1987309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy galvanized metal sheets, wood, nails and wires to improve the remaining walls and move her house to her own land. \r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2015-09-30T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-30T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marina Haydee ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":20.56},{"due_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":20.85},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":22.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2016-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":23.38},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":24.99},{"due_date":"2016-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":25.23},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":26.48},{"due_date":"2016-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":27.2},{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":28.46},{"due_date":"2016-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":29.32},{"due_date":"2016-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":30.44},{"due_date":"2016-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":31.72},{"due_date":"2016-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":32.8},{"due_date":"2016-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":33.99}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.56},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.85},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.09},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.38},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.23},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.48},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.2},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.46},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.32},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.44},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.72},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.8},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":41.41,"local_amount":41.41,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:42:31Z","rounded_local_amount":41.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752012508}],"funded_date":"2015-10-30T15:10:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Pabst","image":1669945}},{"id":953599,"name":"Carmen Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia  pertenece al banco comunal \u201cVIRGEN NATIVIDAD DE HUAYLLABAMBA .\nLa socia Carmen Rosa tiene 06 hijos y es casada, la socia alterna sus actividades diarias dedic\u00e1ndose al negocio de venta de cereales, la socia lleva buen tiempo con su negocio el cual le va bien gracias al empe\u00f1o que le pone cada d\u00eda a su negocio, la socia desea poder seguir trabajando para de esta forma seguir apoyando a su familia.\nLa socia solicita el cr\u00e9dito para la compra de trigo, quinua entre otros.\nLa socia agradece y valora el pr\u00e9stamo y se compromete a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas mensuales.\nLa socia al momento de tomarle la foto se agacho ya que la socia es t\u00edmida.\n","en":"This member belongs to the communal bank \u201cVIRGEN NATIVIDAD DE HUAYLLABAMBA\".\r\n\r\nMember Carmen Rosa is married and has 6 children.

She hopes that these can help her run her farming business smoothly and she can get more yields to upgrade the standard of living for the family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1989487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy organic fertilizer to increase productivity of her crop yield.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Ou Reang Ov district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2015-09-30T19:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-30T19:30:08Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sophea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Thol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sroeurn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4200000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":4200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-20T14:48:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":954990,"name":"Bardhe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bardhe or 'white' in English is a married mother of four, 21 is the oldest and 16 is the youngest.<br \/>To earn a living for their family, Bardhe has been keeping livestock for the past ten years. <br \/><br \/>Currently, she has three cows, three sows and thirty chickens.

He says that it hasn't been easy, but so far things have gone well, and he will use this loan to strengthen his business and establish a new route in the mountains. <br \/><br \/>He is very happy that Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa help owners of micro-enterprises grow their businesses. With this loan, he hopes to increase his earnings so that in the future his wife can dedicate herself solely to her child and they can spend more time together."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1987422,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

married, and is father to a large family of 3 children. He has higher education and is very responsible, honest, hardworking, and works as a dispatcher in the district's electronic station. As a source of supplementary income for his family, he has been engaged in animal husbandry and agriculture for 15 years. Thanks to Azamatbek's persistent hard work, on the farm today there are six cows and 36 sheep. Azamatbek also grows crops on a land share of 2.0 hectares, cultivating watermelons, melons, cabbage, and tomatoes. \r\n\r\nThis year, the unpredictable happened: snow fell in spring, and destroyed the prepared seedlings. Azamatbek put his savings into obtaining new seedlings; however in the summer his crops were attacked by worms, and the still unripened crops were affected, and rotted in the field. Azamatbek suffered damages of around 300,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nAzamatbek found out about the possibility of receiving a favourable loan called 'force majeure' in Bai-Tushum Bank, and has applied for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) in order to restore his land. After buying chemical pest killers for working the land with, part of the funds will be directed into collecting the affected cross from the field, and planting onions.

In the town, everyone calls her caring Cefe. She has a close family made up of her husband, Juan, and their three daughters. One of them is continuing her studies. Together with her husband she devotes herself to the sale of milk. He is in charge of feeding and caring for the cows and she sells milk to the clients. On another side, her taste and passion for cooking motivated her to begin to sell typical foods three years ago. Her specialty is traditional tamales. \"I like to sell, to get my own money, to help my husband, and together, to share family happiness\" she says with a big smile.

The helmet and staff that stand out on the upper part of the coat of arms of this city in Veracruz represent peace, art, commerce and science. This is why its inhabitants have a goal of distinguishing themselves in all activities that they carry out. <br \/><br \/>Unidos Venceremos is the name of a group formed in this community, a name that makes reference to the famous saying \"Unity makes strength\". They are: Severiana and Norma, who sell clothing, shoes and bedspreads; Guadalupe, meat and crystal; Rosa, jewelry and food; Miguel, clothing; Luis, groceries and honey; Concepcion M., jewelry; Ernestina, food; Nati, fish; Leticia, groceries; Anahi, naturopathic products; and Concepcion S., food. <br \/>   <br \/>Severiana, who is better known as Seve, has 2 children. Her daughter is 8 years old and in primary school, and her son works from Monday from Friday and studies on the weekends.

At the same time, they use canes lined and adorned with paper. Nevertheless, the most important characters, those highest on the hierarchy, are the demons, who wear red and black clothing, masks with big horns, and in place of canes, use long, thick cords, known as \"chicotes\". \r\n  \r\n In one of the neighborhoods, group called Avatar was formed. It is made up of: Maria who sells tortillas and embroidered crafts; Celerina, groceries; Nohemi and Xochitil, typical food; Angelica, clothing and shoes: Aurora, food and clothing; Leidy, ceramic works; Janet, clothing, shoes, and cosmetics; Sonia, clothing; Martha, tortillas, and Gloria, cosmetics and mends seams. \r\n  \r\n Ms. Celerina is known as grandmother Cele or Mrs. Cele owing the respect and kindness that those who know her feel for her. She is the mother of ten children who have taken responsibility for  the family's growth, which has been very satisfying. The need to offer the best to her children motivated her to start a grocery store in the community. \r\n\r\n As a beginning, she placed a pair of boards on tree trunks and on top of those she displayed the little merchandise she had at the time. \"I asked a lot in order for my store to grow and I promised that I would construct a small chapel to show my gratitude for the blessings\" she notes happily. Some time later, her business was filled with customers and now she has succeeded not only to install shelves where she displays the products but also she was able to expand the space in the two rooms at the side of her home. Her good treatment of her customers and the reasonable prices that she offers her customers have been key to her success. \r\n\r\nHer earnings perfectly cover the costs of her household and also cover the care of her sick daughter. With the loan, she will be able to invest in eggs, cooking oil, soup, detergents, and cheese, continuing with the ample variety that satisfies her customers. \r\n\r\n*They are the members of Avatar. The photograph was taken on the patio of Ms. Maria. Ms. Cele wears a pink shift with a border of flowers. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":612.5,"image":{"id":1986665,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase eggs, cooking oil, soup, detergent, and cheese.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Vicente,Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-09-30T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-10-30T22:50:02Z","loan_amount":2450,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Xochitl ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Lourdes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celerina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leidy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aurora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nohemi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":41000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":306.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":612.5,"local_amount":10250,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:29:48Z","rounded_local_amount":10350.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752292025}],"funded_date":"2015-10-08T15:42:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rhonda Sarnoff","image":null}},{"id":955127,"name":"Felix","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Simfex Academy was opened in January 2011 by Felix and his wife.

When they were sold, we would make a new design. My designs used a very wide range of materials \u2013 glass, stones, soil and gemstones. I couldn't take many orders because only the two of us crafted the designs, and we were afraid that we might not be able to deliver them on time. Sometimes, I'd take an entire week or two to finish a piece. I'd even forget to sleep!\"<br \/><br \/>\"My stock of raw materials is very low.

Remembering seeing others producing these since he was a child, including his parents, was reason for him to also start a business.  To begin, he made his own loom and actually already has a small workshop with two machines on which a few of his children work.  Tall the pieces carry impressive designs such as horses, flowers, hummingbirds, and other types of birds and Mazahua borders.<br \/><br \/>During a period of low sales, Panchito had to work in home construction in the country\u2019s capital, away from his family.

One woman has a \u201ctortilleria\u201d where she makes tortillas by hand three times a day. Others have convenience stores where they sell staples needed for daily use.

She is so pleased that all five have been able to attend school. She is also the leader of this loan group of nine members.<br \/><br \/>Marina helps her husband who is a bricklayer meet the expenses of the family. Some time ago she joined the Trust Bank in order to get a loan to purchase items for her convenience store. She was so successful that she opened a second store. She is now requesting a 28,500 GTQ loan to be apportioned among the nine members. She will use her share to buy inventory for both of her stores in order to meet customer demand. <br \/><br \/>These nine women look forward to their monthly meetings where they make payments on their loans. A Friendship Bridge facilitator is in attendance and conducts educational trainings using games, role playing and drawings. Many if not most of the ladies do not read and write. They learn about all kinds of essential subjects like effective business management techniques (planning, budgeting, pricing, marketing, customer service), nutrition, hygiene and health as well as empowerment and self-esteem. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of education and small loans \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d and it works!<br \/><br \/>The ladies share that they are honored that people from all parts of the world learn about them and their small businesses and then fund their loans. They are taking small steps toward a more prosperous and successful future and Kiva investors are such valuable partners in this effort.

In the summer, temperatures of up to 50 degrees in the shade have been recorded.  For this reason, this region has been called by the local poets \"the bride of the sun\".<br \/><br \/>The Ricolino group originated in this locality and its members are characterized by their great sense of humor.  The name of the group corresponds to this quality.  The members and their activities are: Guadalupe and Sara who sell food; Ramon, fruits and vegetables; Ana and Itzel, shoes;  Luz, beauty services; Candido, taxi service; Adriana, articles of silver; and Beatriz who sells perfume as well as offering chiropractic and banquet services.<br \/>   <br \/>Since he was a child, Ramon has made a living selling fruits and vegetables.  He used to accompany his parents to sell itinerantly, and upon coming of majority age, he decided to start his own family and consequently have his own business.

She is married to Roberto, a carpenter-driver and they have children who are studying in college. Mary Rose owns a tricycle that her neighbors rent from her. They pay her the rental fee on a daily basis. In times that her husband has no work as a carpenter, he himself drives the tricycle for income. Simultaneously, Mary Rose raises hogs in their backyard as additional livelihood. It\u2019s impressive how they work together to support the needs of their children and how they strive to save for their future. <br \/><br \/>However, there are times when the tricycle breaks down and their income also stops. Mary Rose has to buy some spare parts and pay for its repair. She implores your heartfelt generosity to lend her an amount of PHP 13,000 for this purpose. She knows that continuous income from her tricycle can help sustain their daily expenses, because their hogs are not yet ready for selling at this time. <br \/><br \/>Mary Rose dreams to have a more stable business by acquiring several units of tricycles and a profitable piggery someday. She prays for good health and complete college education for her children.
