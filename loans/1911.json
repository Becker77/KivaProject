He is married and has started a small livestock breeding business. Marian currently has six dairy cows and five calves for meat production. He sells the milk from the cows. This way his family has a stable monthly income. He breeds the calves for 18 months and then sells them. To secure food for the livestock he cultivates two hectares of land. <br \/><br \/>Marian currently has a serious issue; he does not have electricity in the premises where he keeps the livestock. This spring he built a livestock barn, but he is not able to keep the livestock there as it does not have electricity. In order to solve his problems, Marian needs to connect to the power grid. <br \/><br \/>The new barn will allow him to increase the number of cows, which in turn will bring in a larger income for developing the business further.

They have certainly helped sustain her store and thus helped in their daily sustenance. Despite her age, at sixty four she is thankful that she is still strong enough to attend to her store and piggery business.<br \/><br \/>She is once again humbly asking for a Php 50000 PHP loan to buy and refill her store with more quantities of canned goods, coffee, soda, instant noodles, eggs, cooking oil, beverages, toiletries, etc. to attract more customers. Part of the loan she will use to buy feed to raise healthy hogs. Teodora hopes you will again consider her request.<br \/><br \/>Teodora's simple dream is for her store to grow and have a bigger piggery farm so she could help send her grandchildren to school. Every week, she meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God which she studies .<br \/><br \/> *All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
