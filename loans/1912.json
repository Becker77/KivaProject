All of the members are very hard-working and extremely responsible people, their businesses are guarantees of good quality and the best service. <br \/><br \/>Domitila is an enterprising woman who has undertaken various businesses with her husband. One of them is the production of organic manure in their two forms: liquid and solid. This manure is produced by raising earthworms, a process which is called vermiculture and consists of getting large earthworms to later feed them with fruit, food and vegetables. Some time later, these little animals transform all this organic residue into nutrient-rich manure. This product can be used to advantage with any type of crop, the resulting benefits are surprising since they are more healthful and environmentally-friendly in comparison to their chemical parallels. <br \/><br \/>Domi, as she is lovingly called, has had 16 uninterrupted years in charge of her ecologic business. Along with this, she works making flower arrangements since, thanks to her manure, the flowers that are grown in her fields are very beautiful and aromatic. Although she began almost by accident, since at one point it occurred to her to go out into the plaza to sell bunches of flowers and when she saw her earnings were favorable, she decided to work at it completely. In the same way, her manure allows her to grow broad beans, tomatoes, prickly pears, peaches, and other products. As if this were not enough, some months ago she began raising turkeys which she will sell for Christmas.<br \/><br \/>She is very grateful for the benefits of the loan because her businesses are gradually growing. With this new loan, she will be able to purchase a vehicle to transport her merchandise, \"We really want a change to make transportation easier,\" she said. <br \/><br \/>The other members of the group are: Teresa who will invest in soft drinks; Vincente and Jos\u00e9 in organic manure and Cornelio in shoes. <br \/><br \/>*The photo was taken in the municipal garden.

Huelga decir que la comunidad ha mantenido la lengua y cultura mazahua a trav\u00e9s del paso del tiempo. Otras cualidades a destacar son su car\u00e1cter humilde y su esp\u00edritu trabajador.\n   Do\u00f1a Juana es quiz\u00e1s la m\u00e1s amigable del grupo pues siempre busca sacar una sonrisa a las personas que conoce.

Other qualities that stand out are their humble character and their spirit of working.<br \/><br \/>Juana is perhaps the most friendly of the group as she is always looking to get a smile out of the people she knows. She is totally dedicated to her family which is made up of her husband Sebasti\u00e1n who works driving a taxi and five children, only two of whom are dependent on the couple. Juanita, as she is known with affection, motivated her husband to offer taxi services as in her community there is only bus service and it only goes twice a day. For this reason the couple decided to save and acquire a vehicle that they adapted to provide service as a taxi.<br \/>  <br \/>At present Sebasti\u00e1n works every day in the taxi while Juana works raising sheep, selling fruit and vegetables and also offering natural products to obtain extra revenues. Her greatest dream is for her children to complete university and thus have better employment opportunities.<br \/><br \/>On the other hand Juanita has been working with VF M\u00e9xico for many years.

As this is the only income-generating source for the family, the couple wants to buy bulk stock of good-quality bananas for sale. Buying the stock in bulk will help to reduce her husband's frequent travel to the market, and eventually, transportation and buying costs.<br \/><br \/>So, Puspa is seeking a loan amount from BJS, Kiva's field partner, to purchase stock of bananas in bulk. This will improve their earnings, enhance the business, and provide a decent lifestyle to her family.<br \/><br \/>Puspa is thankful to her lenders."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1989582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase bananas in bulk for her husband\u2019s banana-selling business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Falakata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":334,"posted_date":"2015-10-02T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-01T18:00:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Puspa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-16T01:32:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":954546,"name":"Maria Deysy Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda, administra una tienda de productos varios, en su inicios ofrec\u00eda espec\u00edficamente boquitas y dulces, con las ganancias ha logrado ir ofreciendo m\u00e1s productos a sus clientes, abre su negocio a las 7:40 am. y cierra a las 5:00 pm.; es una madre soltera que tiene que sacar adelante a dos hijos, no cuenta con ayuda econ\u00f3mica de otras personas, sus hijos est\u00e1n estudiando.\nInvertir\u00e1 en granos b\u00e1sicos, caf\u00e9 instant\u00e1neo, az\u00facar, sal, pan, huevos, etc., aumentara su inventario para que los clientes contin\u00faen visitando su negocio, espera poder incrementar las ventas y ganancias. \nSu objetivo es cancelar la deuda en un corto tiempo.\n","en":"Mar\u00eda manages a shop that sells various products.

Through Stephanie's optimism and determination, she has managed to find a balance between caring for her child who requires special care, while recovering from her financial distress.   \n\nStephanie bought a modest home where she wants to stay with her daughter for the rest of her life, however the home is in need of several repairs including a new air conditioner that is critical to the well being of her child and has a great impact on the quality of life that both Stephanie and her daughter can achieve in their home. \n\nStephanie has tried to obtain financing through banks, but the payments are too high due to her credit being damaged after her divorce.   Since paying off her debt, Stephanie has had a perfect payment history on all her bills and currently has very little outstanding debt. \n\n Stephanie is hoping that Kiva and SELF will help her replace her old air conditioning unit that has become inoperable. Replacing this old unit will greatly improve the living conditions for her daughter and herself as the temperatures in the home are often higher than extreme temperatures outdoors.

He lives in a modest home that he tries his best to maintain while keeping his expenses to a minimum. While Theodore has incurred in very little debt throughout the years, after the housing crisis in Florida, he found that his home had no equity and that he owed much more on his mortgage than his home was worth. This prevented Theodore from using his home equity line of credit for emergencies and repairs leaving him without financing options just as he was transitioning into retirement. \n\nTheodore tried desperately to keep his house up and stay afloat during the housing recession but ultimately the hardships experienced during this time damaged his credit. He has since, been unable to finance much needed home repairs through banks due to the high rates being more than he can afford. He has attempted to save and pay for some repairs out of pocket, but when his air conditioner stopped working this summer, it was much more than he could afford to pay up front.  Theodore is hoping that SELF and Kiva will help him replace his old unit and make his home more livable. Currently, the temperature inside his home surpasses the average 85-90 degrees registering outdoors.\n \nTheodore will use his Kiva loan to purchase a new air conditioning unit to improve his quality of life and the livability of his home.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":156.88,"image":{"id":1974859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home

Lo que s\u00ed tienen muy presente son sus fiestas patronales ya que realizan bailes, juegos, comidas, etc. Otro rasgo importante es que la mayor parte de la poblaci\u00f3n se dedica al cultivo de ma\u00edz pues es la base de su alimentaci\u00f3n.\n   Alma es parte integral de un grupo que solicit\u00f3 los pr\u00e9stamos de VF M\u00e9xico, es una mujer muy trabajadora y responsable que, ante todo, busca la estabilidad econ\u00f3mica para su familia. Desde hace 4 a\u00f1os se dedica a la compra y venta de productos electrodom\u00e9sticos, herramientas, materiales reciclados, juguetes, ventanas, es decir, que adquiere art\u00edculos descompuestos o usados y despu\u00e9s de repararlo e incluso remodelarlos los pone a la venta en su comunidad.\n   Todos los d\u00edas lunes se puede encontrar en un peque\u00f1o puesto ubicado en el centro del municipio donde aprovecha para vender toda su mercanc\u00eda. No obstante, ahora que conoce a VF M\u00e9xico pudo comprar una vaca peque\u00f1a para iniciar una actividad secundaria que le genere ganancias extras. \"Quiero tener animales ya que siempre me ha llamado la atenci\u00f3n cuidar de ellos, pero pienso continuar con mi otra actividad para generar m\u00e1s beneficios\" coment\u00f3 entusiasmada. \n   Cabe mencionar que es un ejemplo para sus compa\u00f1eras pues contagia su manera de ver la vida y su esfuerzo para enriquecer sus actividades. Adem\u00e1s, con sus ganancias pudo comprar una vivienda que le asegura un patrimonio a sus hijos. Su meta es aumentar la producci\u00f3n de su negocio para que su esposo pueda trabajar hombro con hombro con ella; adem\u00e1s desea abrir una tienda de abarrotes.\n    Las otras integrantes del grupo son Mar\u00eda Guadalupe quien invertir\u00eda en dulces; Soledad, en ropa y Cristina, en pollos.\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en el negocio de Alma quien asoma la cabeza en la parte de atr\u00e1s. \n","en":"Anyone visiting this community in the state of Mexico can't miss the beautiful scenery and countryside, which evoke a feeling a peace.  A large part of the population there have maintained the Mazahua language and their traditions, although unfortunately those are gradually disappearing.  What they do keep solidly in mind are their patron saint festivals, because they throw dances, hold games, make food, and so on.  Another important characteristic is that a majority of the population works growing corn, which is the foundation of their diet.\n\nAlma is an integral part of a group that is asking for loans from VF M\u00e9xico.  She is a very hardworking and responsible woman who, above all, is seeking financial stability for her family.  For the past four years she has worked buying and selling household appliances, tools, recycled materials, toys, and windows.  That is to say, she gets broken or used items and, after fixing them up or even completely re-making them, she sells them in her community.\n\nEvery Monday she can be found in a small stall located in the center of town where she sells all her merchandise.  Nevertheless, now that she knows VF M\u00e9xico, she could buy a small cow to start a new, secondary line of work that will give her extra income.  \u201cI want to have animals because caring for them has always appealed to me, but I\u2019m thinking of continuing my other job in order to get more earnings,\u201d she says, enthusiastically.  \n\nIt is worth mentioning that she sets an example for her group mates because her way of seeing life and her effort to improve her work are contagious.
