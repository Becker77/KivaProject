I went because I wanted to, and I would spend all my time there, unless I was at school. Eventually I began to learn how to sculpt gemstone figurines, which was a slow process. I began sculpting birds by first observing a model I liked and then replicating it. Sometimes I would take photographs of nature, and then replicate what I shot with stones. Birds are my specialty, and amethyst and quartz are my favorite gems. My wife helps me by mounting the pieces. I enjoy working with her.

Tanya has kept her daycare thriving in this difficult time and continues to improve it, so she can provide income for her family. \n\nTanya will use her Kiva loan to buy more furniture and learning materials for her daycare. She wants to bring a new level of quality care to her business by making a more comfortable play area and by providing enriching books and educational tools for the children she cares for."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":49.87,"image":{"id":1991861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Child Care","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy more furniture and learning materials for her daycare.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Chula Vista","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":249,"posted_date":"2015-10-03T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-02T21:00:03Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tanya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1482,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.27},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.73},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.86},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.69},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.74},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.39},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.8},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.13},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.52},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.93},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.85},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.19},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.73},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.04},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.67},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.66},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.41},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.69},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.91},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.78},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.96},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.93},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.38},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.51},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.35},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.43},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.07},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.84},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.24},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.66},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.59},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.95},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.49},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.82},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.46},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.46},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.23},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.51},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.75},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.63},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.82},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.8},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":49.87,"local_amount":49.27,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-26T13:11:02Z","rounded_local_amount":49.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":753584530}],"funded_date":"2015-10-05T17:43:46Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":954723,"name":"Leoncio Agapito","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Leoncio es un hombre de 55 a\u00f1os que vive junto a su pareja en la localidad rural de Talamolle Viejo, que est\u00e1 ubicada en Moquegua. \u00c9l se dedica a trabajos m\u00faltiples como peonaje agr\u00edcola y cr\u00eda de ganado vacuno org\u00e1nico, poniendo mucha atenci\u00f3n en el cuidado y en la alimentaci\u00f3n que les brinda, que est\u00e1 constituida por alfalfa org\u00e1nica que \u00e9l mismo cultiva.

She is a married mother of 9 and only 3 are the only ones who are not school going. She is 39 years old and the only bread winner of her family, since her husband is incapacitated or crippled, so can help not much on this huge family. <br \/><br \/>She started this coffee trade business the day she got married to her husband in order to support her children that she would bear in her marriage. Apart from the coffee trade business she also owns a sugar cane plantation where she makes juice that later turns into local brew or enguli that she sells to supplement her finances.

With the new loan he will continue to build in order to continue improving his quality of life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1988930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to invest in cinder blocks, iron, cement, sand and to pay labor costs for the construction of a retaining wall.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2015-10-03T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-02T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jerber Salvador ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":20.21},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":20.36},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":21.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":21.98},{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":22.85},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":24.69},{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":24.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":26.03},{"due_date":"2016-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":26.6},{"due_date":"2016-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":27.97},{"due_date":"2016-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":28.68},{"due_date":"2016-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":29.77},{"due_date":"2016-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":31.16},{"due_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":32.09},{"due_date":"2016-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":33.49},{"due_date":"2017-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":34.59},{"due_date":"2017-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":35.9},{"due_date":"2017-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":37.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.21},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.36},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.71},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.98},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.85},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.69},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.03},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.6},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.97},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.68},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.77},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.16},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.09},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.49},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.59},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.9},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-02T20:05:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stephanie Allen","image":1982692}},{"id":956821,"name":"Lydia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lydia is 44 years old and has seven children.

This is Savio. He is the head teacher of Rose Pask Primary School, a mixed school in the urban area of Kisubi in Kampala with 450 students. Rose Pask School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.
