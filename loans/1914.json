However, due to the lack of money, he finds it difficult to cover the cost of a new rickshaw. <br \/><br \/>Therefore, Shakeela has requested a loan from Kiva's partner BRAC Pakistan to help her husband to cover the cost of a new rickshaw. This will help him to continue his business. <br \/><br \/>Shakeela is so much thankful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1989541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy an auto rickshaw for her husband.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Multan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30.195556 71.475278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":247,"posted_date":"2015-10-04T15:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-03T15:30:11Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shakeela\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2786.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2875.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2967.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3062.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3160.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3261.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3366.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3473.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3585.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3699.67},{"due_date":"2016-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3818.67},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3940.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.76},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.68},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.63},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.61},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.62},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.74},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.85},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.99},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.18},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-02T18:53:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":956876,"name":"Milagros","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Milagros is 68 years old and widowed.

She shares that she learned to manage this business on her own initiative more than 12 years ago. \r\n\r\nThe loan that she will take out now will bring an increase in capital (by buying potatoes, rice, noodles wholesale) which she will get from vendors in the city of El Alto. Afterwards, she will market them in her own retail space. This way of working allows her to generate resources to support her family financially, since she is married and has six children. \r\n\r\nWhen asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she responds that she likes the training and the health area that the institution offers. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1989852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy potatoes, rice and noodles wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2015-10-04T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-03T20:50:01Z","loan_amount":4175,"lender_count":123,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabet Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucy Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wendy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":28672,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3379.04},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3861.76},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3966.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":4074.56},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4186},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4298.56},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4905.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":492.03},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.32},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":577.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":593.31},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":609.53},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625.92},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":714.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-03T16:11:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Pezdek","image":null}},{"id":957042,"name":"Nibale","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nibale is a 33 year old married Lebanese woman living with her husband and fur children who are still studying.

The hardworking women in the group range in age from 21 to 42. Almost all of these hardworking women have children who are enrolled in school. The Trust Bank is on their third loan with Kiva as they are most pleased with the positive results achieved with past loans. They have maintained and expanded their small businesses and been able to meet the monthly expenses of their households.<br \/><br \/>Manuela is the 28-year-old Secretary of the Trust Bank who studied until the sixth grade. Her husband works in agriculture and the couple has an eight-year-old daughter who is enrolled in elementary school. Besides working with her husband, Manuela buys and sells shoes in her very own shoe store right in town. In addition, she has a textile business and creates beautiful traditional blouses called \u201chuipiles\u201d. She is requesting a loan to purchase a large variety of shoes in various colors and sizes for men, women and children. She has had two loans with Kiva and has realized great strides and increased income in her businesses. Manuela is most excited about the possibility of an additional loan and she is hopeful that Kiva lenders will fund it.<br \/><br \/>Kiva lenders are much appreciated partners with Friendship Bridge in this effort. Thank you, Kiva lenders!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1989676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a large variety of shoes in various colors and sizes for men, women and children","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Nahual\u00e1, Solol\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2015-10-04T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-03T21:20:01Z","loan_amount":3050,"lender_count":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela Claudia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela Matilde ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia Faviana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":23237,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":3050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1940.69},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1940.69},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1940.69},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1940.69},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1940.69},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1940.69},{"due_date":"2016-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1940.69},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1940.69},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1940.69},{"due_date":"2016-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1940.69},{"due_date":"2016-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1940.69},{"due_date":"2016-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1889.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.73},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.73},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":254.73},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.73},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.73},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.73},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.73},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.73},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.73},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.72},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":254.72},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":247.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-03T16:25:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":957046,"name":"Fatmeh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fatmeh is a Lebanese married woman.

She started her business when she lost her job. She told herself that she had to have some activity for her family's well being, so she decided to buy a photocopier with few specifications so that she could offer that service from her house. Nonetheless, she had a good response and her spouse decided to help her, so he bought her a larger photocopier that was portable. Later, he bought her a desktop computer to expand the services she offers. Her mother proposed that she buy shoes and clothing, which are easy to sell in the towns of Magdalena, and she invested in her as well. Today she is a successful micro-businesswoman who manages several roles in her life: housewife, mother, and wife. She is very happy to bring well being to her family with her work. That is why she is applying for her first Kiva loan through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to invest in shoes and clothing to maintain an inventory for the end of the year season.

She lives with two of her grandchildren, age 12 and 16, and one of her sick children, aged 68. Mantsane, now in a family of four, lives in a traditional hut that is not well-ventilated, nor warm in winter. She works long tiring hours to ensure there is enough food for her entire family, some of whom are going to school and only help her in the field on Saturdays and Sundays, and one who is sick and needs her constant care. Together with her eldest grandchild, she has to wake up between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. during the week to start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water and warming the house for the children before they go to school. <br \/><br \/>Collecting firewood, setting up the fire and doing the actual cooking demands a lot of her time. Temperatures in the Lesotho highlands are never really high; winters can get very cold, and often Mantsane has to start the fire inside her hut. Starting a fire releases smog and smoke which, when inhaled in large quantities over a period of time, can lead to lung diseases, eye problems and in the worst cases, to death. In these circumstances, life for women like Mantsane has been very difficult. <br \/><br \/>Mantsane has requested a loan from Kiva lenders in order to be able to purchase a clean cook stove that will provide her -- and nine other people from her village who are living in similar circumstances -- the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families, and that does not require a lot of wood -- hard to find in Lesotho -- nor expensive paraffin and gas. This stove can be started with the use of very little readily available biomass like dry twigs and dry cow dung that do not require lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the homes. <br \/><br \/>This stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery that runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones and a mini LED lamp  --a life improving package for these people. This stove saves them time to be with their family, saves energy, eliminates the element of toxic inhalation and the danger of house fires. It has given them the freedom to have a better lit home to see better in the evening while cooking and enables children to do their homework.
