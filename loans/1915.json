She will use the loan to purchase a small trading trolley where she will operate from. The trolley is going to be placed outside one of the biggest shops in Malawi and so there will be a lot of traffic. The loan will also be used to serve customers as working capital float in her day to day transactions and to purchase a mobile phone which she will use to perform the transactions. <br \/><br \/>With the earnings from her business, Chimwemwe is hopeful that she can take her son to a good school.

divorced and raising 3 children. She has been involved in farming and animal husbandry for 15 years. She has 3 cows and 15 sheep on her farm. She grows strawberries on her land. Aziya is also involved in selling vegetables and fruits. Her monthly profit amounts to 15,000 som (KGS), but this money is not enough for a decent life and support for her family. This is why, to continue developing her business, Aziya requested a loan in the amount of 40,000 som (KGS) from the Bai Tushum Bank to increase her livestock headcount by buying 8 sheep. Aziya is one of the three members of the Ak-Peyil group.

She has completed secondary education and she is involved in agriculture for a living. Thanks to her hard work, she now owns 2.0 ha land lot where she cultivates potatoes.

She plans to buy more animals to increase their earnings.\r\n\r\nThis is how Esteban's business will grow gradually and improve.  Now it has six hatcheries but the goal is to build more.  \"Fortunately, we have a lot of work and people are interested in this food\", he says enthusiastically.  Another goal is to build tanks to have enough water when the rainy season ends.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the success achieved through the business, around 400 kilos of fish are sold every month, which is not a small amount considering that they started without anyone's help.  However, there are plans to increase production to 800 kilos a month.

The region is surrounded by vegetation and the fields that produce the crops of corn demonstrate how rich the land is.  <br \/><br \/>Viviana is a lively and enthusiastic woman who, just like any mother, works hard to take care of her two daughters, but she has to fill the roles of both mother and father at the same time. <br \/><br \/>Vivi, as her friends call her, has worked for several years in raising poultry. She buys the birds when they are very small and once they have reached their ideal developmental stage, she sells them in her community. She also uses the product herself, especially the eggs that the hens produce daily. She currently has 55 specimens, which she cares for without any problems. \"I always keep them locked up so they don't damage my neighbor's corn crops or get lost. It's easier to raise them this way,\" she tells us with satisfaction. When she began working in this trade, she didn't have a hen house, but with hard work she was able to buy the material to build the one that she now considers the source of her income. <br \/><br \/>She is very grateful for the support of VF Mexico because she will be able to buy more small specimens. She will also buy food for her animals and have them vaccinated against common illnesses. One of Vivi's goals is to improve production in her business so she'll be able to earn a higher income. With this she will be able to build a house out of concrete; she is currently living in a house made of wood. However, her main goal is to provide an education for her daughters, who rely on her. <br \/> <br \/>The other members of the group, Andr\u00e9s, Isabel, and Ang\u00e9lica, will use the loan to buy sheep.
