Her monthly income is about 16,000 som (KGS). \r\n\r\nWith the view of further developing her business, Kyzylgul has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 30,000 som (KGS) in order to increase her livestock headcount through buying two calves. Part of the funds will go into buying fertilisers and fuel for growing crops. Kyzylgul is the leader of the group 'Ak-Peiil', and there are only three people in the group.

Life in the Philippines is a big challenge especially in raising a family. Evelyn and her husband put their best effort to provide for their children and give them an education as it is their path for better opportunities in life.  \r\n\r\nEvelyn and her husband derive income from their junk shop. They engage in the buying and selling of recyclable materials. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines. While waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials such as metal, copper, plastic, paper, and other materials. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries and factories.\r\n\r\nEvelyn is requesting a loan for 20,000 PHP, which she will use to purchase old newspapers, galvanized iron, plastic, paper, and metal products to sell. Operating a junk shop is literally a dirty business but she values it for it their main source of income to provide for her family and send her children to school. Evelyn's precious dream is to send her children to college to prepare them for a better future. \r\n\r\nEvery week Evelyn meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from God. \r\n\r\n* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Runubala supplements her husband's income by sewing and selling clothes to her villagers.

To improve her productivity and take on more customers, she wants to buy a new and better sewing machine. To put this plan into action, Runubala needs access to funds.

She sells various commodities that are essential to the everyday living of the people in her area. These include sachets of shampoo, toothpaste, soap, snacks, candies, bread, repacked condiments and many other items. Basically, she earns enough to provide some of their basic needs but there are times that it\u2019s not sufficient. Thus, she also ventured into load retailing or electronic load for cellphones. It is also a viable business because most cellphone owners use the prepaid plan and only a few subscribe to a postpaid plan. In prepaid arrangements, a person can budget his load usage because he can buy as low as 10-pesos worth of load. Nelfa and her farmer husband, Joesen, work persistently for their only child. They are not content to just make a daily living because they aspire to save more for the future. <br \/><br \/>With this forward-looking mindset, Nelfa wants to make her business more profitable. She would like to avail a loan amounting to PHP 10,000 to buy assorted groceries, snack items, and soft drinks for her store. She will also set aside some amount for her e-loading business. She is hoping that additional income from this loan will not only sustain their everyday needs, but will also boost her savings for the future. Someday she wants to see her business grow into a big grocery store. <br \/><br \/>She draws inspiration from her co-fellowship* members who meet every week to share stories of their life and business and to draw strength from the Word of God. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

This is his story:<br \/><br \/>\"As I was growing up, I used to carve some in school, but little did I know that I would one day become a woodcarver. I moved to Accra to live with my dad. At the time, my father was into carving and had been asking to me to join him in his workshop, but I wasn't interested. I once visited him at work and he asked me to help with some masks. To his surprise, I finished earlier than his apprentice and did a good job. My dad sold the masks and gave me a commission. That convinced me. I quit my job as a gardener and started assisting my father. Eventually, I went to a master carver to learn how to carve other items and also to improve on my skills. In my designs I look out for accuracy and good imagination and creativity. I get inspiration from my environment and the people around me. My hope and plans for the future include establishing a workshop in my hometown and starting a tree farm and a fish farm to help the youth there have a source of income.<br \/><br \/>\"Without your help, our dreams could never come to pass.

She owns a sari-sari (variety) store in Toril, Davao City. She's been running her store for 10 years. She has already experienced different circumstances that really challenged her faith. There were times when her capital was almost drained due to the large sums of money owed to her. Some of her neighbors pay weeks or months later for the goods they get from her store. But Restita remains strong, because this is her way of assisting her fisherman husband, Rafael, in providing for their children\u2019s needs. Their children are still studying in college.<br \/><br \/>A sari-sari store is comparable to a convenience store, but it\u2019s smaller and has limited products. Examples of these products are sachets of toiletries, snack items, canned goods, instant foods, candies, beverages and other commodities. It\u2019s quite advantageous for the people in the community to have an accessible variety store to buy one candy, an egg, and so on. This is the reason why sari-sari stores proliferate in the communities of the Philippines. This is also the reason why the competition becomes stiffer and stiffer. Customers prefer to buy from stores with wide selection and inventory. Restita worries about this because she can offer only limited stock. She appeals for your help through a loan of 40,000 PHP, which she can use to buy more supplies to improve her store. She aspires to grow her sales to be able to earn more. <br \/><br \/>Restita dreams that in the near future her business will progress and she can be a rice wholesaler. She wants her children to finish college and obtain good, stable jobs. She\u2019s praying for long life as well as mental and spiritual well-being for her whole family. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is comprised of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":255.22,"image":{"id":1994112,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more supplies to improve her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Davao City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"7.073056 125.612778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-10-07T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-06T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Restita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.45},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.45},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.45},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":255.22,"local_amount":11666.69,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:15:14Z","rounded_local_amount":11891.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045724}],"funded_date":"2015-10-07T13:31:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Greg Gibson","image":null}},{"id":955940,"name":"Cruz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cruz de 43 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su esposa, el se dedica desde hace 23 a\u00f1os al cultivo de ca\u00f1a de azucar y comercializa sus productos en los pueblos aleda\u00f1os, con las ganancias que obtiene logra solventar algunos gastos de su hogar, el esta solicitando un credito para la compra de abono, fertelizantes, controles de plagas, etc. y asi poder continuar con su trabajo para tener mejores ingresos economicos.","en":"Cruz is 43 years old and lives in his own house with his wife.

While living in the country side, he felt a great pleasure learning to take care of the animals. At first his parents helped him buy the first livestock. Later, he bought more with his earnings. \"My first animal was a small sheep that grew very well. Later, that motivated me to have many more.\" he said happily. It takes 8 or 6 months of process to reach the ideal weight so that they can be sold at a good price.<br \/><br \/>For many years, his work has supported his family and his goals.

managing her sari-sari store business at Taguig City. She has involved herself in this trade for six years now. Being a member of CCT, she was highly motivated to improve her business more through the word of God that they study every week. As of now, she is working persistently to provide for the daily needs of her household. <br \/><br \/>Sari-sari stores are often seen everywhere in the Philippines, most especially along the sidewalks and streets. It is most likely a convenience store, but quite smaller than the usual and offers only limited products that are commonly needed such as toiletries, food, instant beverages and other commodities. Unlike grocery stores, sari-sari stores offer products at a low cost and on a retail basis, which is really an advantage for the customers. At some point, customers can also have credit. But this sometimes becomes a difficulty for Minerva, especially when debts are not paid. <br \/><br \/>To improve her sales, Minerva would like to ask for help from you. She would like to borrow a loan worth PHP 50,000 that she would use to purchase additional products and merchandise items for her store. With this, she expects to grow her sales and provide a better remedy for her family\u2019s daily living conditions. And, today, you can be a big part of her life. <br \/><br \/>She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1993618,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional products and merchandise items for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Taguig City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-10-07T13:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-06T13:30:02Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Minerva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.8},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-03T01:53:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":958307,"name":"Josette","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josette is 25 years old and married with two children.<br \/><br \/>She is in the agricultural business of farming rice in the Philippines.

Hasta el d\u00eda de hoy ha demostrado ser trabajadora y muy responsable.

She is 65 years old, the mother of two children, who are both adults and financially independent.  She lives with her husband in a very large property, which she shares with her mother and daughter - all in their separate houses but on the same grounds.  Do\u00f1a Virginia has been engaged in selling clothes, especially children's clothes, since before her retirement.  She has taken up this business with more effort after her retirement, which allows her to care for her elderly mother and brother, who is visually impaired. <br \/><br \/>As she is very familiar with her business and has 19 years of experience, one can consider the good use of her financial resources.  For all her life she has proven to be hardworking and very responsible.  Additionally, her business allows her to stay active, mentally engaged, and to invest her time in something that she likes to do, such as commerce; which also gives her the opportunity to generate additional income for the household.  All the merchandise she sells is bought in New York; she travels 2 to 3 times a year to buy the merchandise.<br \/><br \/>She started with her own capital in 1996, with the savings that she had thanks to her work.  She decided to travel to New York, where she managed to buy clothes and cosmetics for her co-workers and family, and she managed to sell everything.  They took more orders, and so she decided to travel again and bring sufficient merchandise, so that from then on, this has allowed her to travel three times a year for new goods and thus she has maintained this business for over 19 years.<br \/><br \/>Her main customers are her educator colleagues, neighbors, acquaintances, relatives and many others from various communities of Heredia.  Most of her customers visit her home, as much as to buy merchandise there as to pay her, too.

Trias, Cavite, Philippines. She is married to Bernard, who is a driver. They work as a team making a living and raising their two children, who are in high school and elementary. Since her husband's salary is not enough to fully cover the growing household expenses and the children's school needs, Rosanna decided to open a small internet shop in their community.   <br \/><br \/>She has been operating her computer rental shop for two years already and is glad that it is doing quite well. In the Philippines, very few people have their own computers. People go to an internet shop either for their business and business documents, or for school requirements. She rents out computers by the hour and also offers printing and typing services. <br \/><br \/>To further improve her services, Rosanna would like to buy a new computer for her business, for which she will be needing funds to the amount of PHP 40,000. The income generated from her internet shop helps a lot with their daily household expenses and the school requirements of her children. <br \/><br \/>She thanks God and you in advance for your valuable help.<br \/><br \/>Rosanna aims to open another branch in a nearby town and to send her children to college, to allow them to become professionals.

With these strong belief systems, it is not hard to imagine why Faustina has always dreamt of starting her own pre-school. She is a single 28 year old vibrant woman who has set out to change the lives of children in her high density community of Chitungwiza.<br \/><br \/>Faustina opened her pre-school which is named after one of the warmest person known in history \u201cMother Theresa.\u201d Her pre-school is undoubtedly a place where love and kindness flourishes. This can be easily seen because of the happily glowing faces of children in her care. Faustina has a total of 18 pupils, a number she certainly hopes to grow. Her pre-school has been facing numerous problems. These include very few toys, reading and play materials for the children to peacefully share. <br \/><br \/>Living in a high density area in Chitungwiza, water shortages are very common but with small children this can quickly become a health hazard. Faustina wants to buy a water tank that will cater for her pre-school. This is why Faustina and her friends came to Thrive to make up the group Mukadzi kushanda. They joined Thrive in August 2015. With a loan from Thrive Faustina can better develop her pre-school and attract more pupils and grow her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1989559,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to buy a water tank for her pre-school use.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Chitungwiza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-10-07T16:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-06T16:50:09Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vernamay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faustina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ellen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":233.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-07T23:29:47Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":954508,"name":"Daniel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daniel is a resident of Boroboro in Lira District.

can be an instrument to help Nemia reach her dreams!<br \/><br \/>Here is Nemia, a 53 year-old sari-sari (general) store owner from Polomolok, South Cotabato. She has run her business for 12 years now. The proliferation of this type of business makes the competition stiff; hence store owners like Nemia try many techniques to make their business stable and competitive. She combines her variety store with charcoal vending to encourage more buyers. Many residents in her community use charcoal stoves instead of LPG or electric stoves.<br \/><br \/>Nemia needs to strive harder because one of her children with Daniel, a farmer, is still studying. She wants to increase her income, and one way to attain this is to acquire supplementary capital of 12,000 PHP, which she will use to buy assorted groceries, sacks of rice and charcoal. <br \/><br \/>Nemia knocks at your generous hearts for your kind support.

Her rolling capital was used up. <br \/><br \/>To continue with her store business, Loreta applied for a loan worth PHP 22,000, which she can use to buy stocks of groceries, toiletries, snacks, and soft drinks. She will also add sandals, slippers, shoes, and bags. She\u2019s hoping that it will lead to a higher profit that can sustain their everyday needs and the college expenses of her children.

She finished primary school, and since she was little she was taught to work in the cotton fields. She is a single mother of 3 children, one of whom is studying for a Bachelor's in Communications, one of whom works in a pizzeria, and the youngest is still in school. <br \/><br \/>For 6 years Elena's sister has trained her how to make chicken, corn, and beef tamales, as well as empanadas and atoles (a cornflour drink with rice and milk). In this activity she has done very well. It generates enough income to support her family.
