Fruits and vegetables grow well because typhoons seldom visit the area. \n\nMary Ann, 35, is selling fruits in one of the public markets Butuan City, Agusan Del Norte. As of now she offers various fruits such as mangoes, apples, soursops, watermelons, bananas, and others. The profits derived from her business helps provide for the basic needs of her family. However, the risk that she faces is the possibility of fruit rotting if these are not sold on time. Somehow, Mary Ann has learned the trade tips from her six years of experience in fruit vending. \n\nNow she desires to buy additional volume of fruits to display in her stall in order to attract more buyers. She implores your kind support to make this possible. A loan worth PhP 30,000 will surely go a long way.\n\nMary Ann is married to Rey, a driver.

children, one of whom is dependent and still in school. This widowed woman supports her family\u2019s living through growing cassava and soybeans. She has been doing this for years. Earning around USD11 per day, Paos can save around USD6 each day. Drop of cassava\u2019s price is the main challenge to her.<br \/><br \/>She decided to form a group of two members to apply for loans from VisionFund. Past loan has helped her improve family\u2019s living condition. In her second cycle loan, Paos, the group leader, will use some of her loan to buy organic fertilizer to support farming business and some to send her children to school.

Hog raising, according to her is quite tiring but she focuses on its sustainability and its contribution to food production for the community.\n\nAside from hog raising, Laila also ventured into variety store business where she sells usual commodities that are essential to everyday living of the people. Somehow it gives her a regular daily income compared to hog raising which takes several months before she receives the return of her investment. \n\nLaila\u2019s husband does his part by driving their tricycle for income. Large chunk of his income goes to the monthly installment for the tricycle. This is why he is very eager to fully pay its last monthly installment so his family can enjoy its full benefits. He will just set aside some amount for its maintenance.\n \nNow Laila is requesting for PhP 20,000 supplementary capital to buy feeds for her hogs and additional supplies for her variety store. She will also allot some amount to pay the last installment for their tricycle. In the next few weeks she can already sell a fattened hog and she can recover her expenses. She aims to steadily improve her hog raising venture to attain her dream of owning a big piggery someday. \n\t\nShe shares her aspirations to her co-fellowship* members at CCT.

Then the entrepreneur or direct selling representative will just enhance the business by expanding her network of target consumers and proper rolling of capital.\n\nLilia, 58, from Davao City is a direct selling representative who sells personal care products such as food supplements, toiletries, intimate apparels, shoes and bags. While her husband, Demetrio, nurtures their small farm. Their children are already grown-up and starting their own families. Hence Lilia can focus her attention to improving her direct selling business. She wants to avail of PHP 29,000 loan to buy more supplies of personal care products. Hopefully it will lead to increased sale and profit that she can save for her retirement. In the Philippines, self-employed workers like her have no pension or medical insurance so they just rely on their own savings and assistance from their children.\n\nShe desires for a good future for her children and harmonious relationship among her family members. She prays that all of them will become believers of Christ. She regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business. There she can draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":260.02,"image":{"id":1994692,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more supplies of personal care products such as food supplements, toiletries, intimate apparel, shoes and bags.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Davao City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"7.073056 125.612778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-10-08T06:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-07T06:30:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":29000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1933.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1933.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1933.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1933.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1933.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1933.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1933.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1933.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1933.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1933.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1933.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1933.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1933.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1933.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1933.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":260.02,"local_amount":11599.98,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":12057.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045736}],"funded_date":"2015-10-08T12:23:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":958697,"name":"Barau","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Barau is maize farmer from Bawa Wambai village.

The profit derived from her business helps a lot in her family's daily expenditure but she still needs to save a lot for her children\u2019s education. She\u2019s planning to cook more meals and enhance the selection in her store. She prays for PHP 25,000 additional capital which she can use to buy raw ingredients for new recipes, additional snack items, frozen foods, and sacks of rice. She knocks at your compassionate heart - may you be a blessing to her.\r\n\r\nCristina is assisted by her husband and business partner, Romo. They aspire to someday be capable of helping others financially. \r\n\r\nShe gains inspiration from her co-fellowship members at CCT who regularly meet every week to reflect of God\u2019s Words and share stories about life and their businesses. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
