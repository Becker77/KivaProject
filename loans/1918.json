Dharamsagar is a remotely located rural village situated in the foothills. <br \/><br \/>Hemakanti, the lady sitting at the extreme right with a raised hand in the photograph, is one of the members of the SHG. She is also the leader of the group. She is a very active lady of 35 years and lives with her husband, three sons, and four daughters. Her elder son has migrated to another state in search of employment. One of her daughters has already completed her tenth standard, and due to unavailability of a higher education facility in the nearest area, stopped her study.   <br \/><br \/>Hemakanti, with the help of her husband, has been fish farming for the last four years. She is doing this in the nearest Minor Irrigation Project, which she has taken on lease from the irrigation department for fish farming. She and her husband have been engaged in the work for seven months, from August to March. According to Hemakanti, on average she earns a monthly income of 10,000 INR. But, to maintain her big family, she faces many difficulties. <br \/><br \/>Therefore she wants to increase her income through improvement of her fishery.

is a woman of the age of 53 years. She is married and has two children. She lives in a small rural village. <br \/><br \/>Since her childhood, Lutfi dreamed of becoming a teacher, but the circumstance were such that she was not able to get higher education due to her family's insufficient finances. Soon after finishing high school, Lutfi got married and became a housewife. But even if she stays at home, Lutfi is never idle. She and her husband strives to provide their children with all necessary things. <br \/><br \/>In order to have a stable income for food, Lutfi and her husband started a business. They work with livestock breeding. Lutfi breeds livestock and then sells the meat and milk. She gets a good income from this business. Lutfi's husband also works with construction and his work brings the family an additional income. Their combined income is enough for middle class living conditions.

Her father insisted that she should get an education. He would very much like her to study be a teacher and become an educated girl. <br \/><br \/>Currently Sunbula is in her third year. Her father is happy and very proud of her. After all there are few people in their village who allow their children to study. Sunbula is very thankful to her father as it is thanks to him that she can expand her knowledge and get to know a new life. She has gotten many friends and a different view of life, and all thanks to her father.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately this year she was not able to pay her tuition. As the times are difficult, her father was not able to help her. Therefore she turned to Arvand for a loan. She thanks Arvand in advance for the support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1978191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for her education","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Panjakent","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-10-08T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-07T21:00:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sunbula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":125.36},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":128.86},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":133.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":134},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":142.83},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":144.75},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":148.66},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":152.09},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":156.78},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":160.11},{"due_date":"2016-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":172.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.59},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.13},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.88},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.94},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.32},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.62},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.23},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.76},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.5},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.02},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-09T00:29:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Audhild Randa","image":132928}},{"id":959139,"name":"Halima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This marks Halima's fourth time borrowing to add fresh stock of fish to sell following the expected rains of Elnino.

This group is located in a remotely rural village named Palsipani of Nuapada district of Odisha, India.

The smiling lady sitting on the extreme right with raised hand in the photo is Santosini. She is a very active and forward lady of 27 years age living with her husband, one son of seven years, and one daughter of eighteen months. Her son has just started his studies in the local government. school.<br \/><br \/>Santosini works as a fourth grade employee in Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) project of the government of Odisha. Apart from that, she has a vegetable cultivation farm of one hectare. Her husband manages the farm. <br \/><br \/>Her husband is an active and cheerful farmer. He produces vegetables like brinjals, cauliflowers, carrots, cabbages, chiles, cucumbers, papayas, ladies' fingers, onions, etc., on the farm and sells the products to the traders of the nearby town who come to take vegetables from the farm.  <br \/><br \/>She says that she earns a minimum amount of 4,000 INR per month from this business which is insufficient to meet the day to day expenses of her family, farm expenses, and business investment. Santosini wants to expand her business by taking a loan from Kiva through her SHG from Mahashakti Foundation. She has planned to utilize the present loan to buy a water pump, seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides for her farm. <br \/><br \/>She expects a good return from this investment. Santosini hopes to construct a house for her family and give better education to her children. She also hopes to give her whole family a bright future through her hard work.  <br \/><br \/>Among the other nine group members, four members are doing the milk business, one member is running a general store, two members are doing vegetable cultivation, and fish selling and goat rearing are done by other two members."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1995509,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to purchase a water pump, seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides for her farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"PALSIPANI, NUAPADA, ODISHA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":242,"posted_date":"2015-10-09T16:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-08T16:30:08Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gomati                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hema","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karfula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Padmini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saebani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santosini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shrimati Hiradei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Subarni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Surya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1850}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-29T10:22:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":959347,"name":"Hadija","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hadija  is a married woman; she has two kids all of attend school.
