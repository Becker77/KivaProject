She was successful in growing her business with the support of a sister-in-law, who is a snack food manufacturer and loaned her a wide variety of these snacks for her sales. \r\n\r\nAt first she sold door to door in the streets to several populations of Atl\u00e1ntico. After some time she decided to place a toy on one side of the sweets, which improved her sales and allowed her to save the capital needed to establish herself as a pi\u00f1ata and snack food distributor.

With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Bulus will store the maize he harvests and delay it\u2019s sale until a later date in the season.

He is considered a man of the land and has made a wonderful family with his wife, Benita, and their five children. The primary motivation that he has is to give the very best of himself for his loved ones and likewise be an example for them in life. To achieve his goals he works by making a meal that is typical of the country and based on  sheep meat: barbacoa. \"It's a family business,\" he cheerfully tells us. Don Albino has 22 years of experience with this trade, for which he raises the animals in a corral on the side of his house. This \"inheritance\" is currently passing to his three daughters, who are very happy to carry out the same work that helped raise them. \"I always teach them that even if they have a trade, they shouldn't become complacent because selling barbacoa is a great way to earn a good income,\" he adds. <br \/><br \/>The process of getting the flavor that characterizes this delicious meal is difficult and requires much attention. However, the profits he makes in return are unique and have covered all of his household expenses and the education of his children. Challenges are unavoidable but the confidence that he has helps him to always have customers, as well as his excellent attention, and the great taste and accessible prices. <br \/><br \/>He is also very grateful for the loan because this will help him to buy more sheep, tires for his vehicle, and supplies to make barbacoa.

The group's name was chosen by its members due to the fact that in the town there is a quarry from which stone and sand are extracted for construction of their homes. The residents are very friendly, very simple, and very hardworking people whose principle activity is farming corn, beans, broad beans, and others. Additionally, they also raise and fatten animals such as sheep, rabbits, calfs, chickens, and turkeys.<br \/><br \/>Mrs. Patricia is a very happy and hardworking person who always maintains an entrepreneurial spirit. Her family is her main driver to give her best every day. She has a husband and three children who continue with their studies. For six months she has been selling clothes and shoes by catalogue. She has a stationary store and additionally, she attends to a grocery store. She has adopted a routine which allows her to carryout her activities. This way, during the day she is responsible for two businesses and once her children arrive from school, she leaves to sell clothes and shoes around her community.<br \/><br \/>What's more, she is very appreciative for the loan she received from VFM\u00e9xico considering that before she only relied on a small home for her entire family and now she was able to construct a house of two floors where they live calmly and comfortably. These benefits also helps her in her businesses since she has been able to remodel them and her husband opened up a new business in a neighboring community. <br \/><br \/>This time, she is requesting a loan to buy more stationary items. Mrs. Paty, as her friends know her, has always had a special liking for covering the needs of people who want to improve themselves. One of her goals is to improve her sales so that she can secure the education of her two daughters who want to study teaching.<br \/><br \/>The other members of the group are Laura, Rosa, Basilia, Elvira, Esmeralda and Branda who want to invest in sheep, and Janeth in embroidery. <br \/><br \/>*The photograph was taken in a part of the community.

For her family\u2019s living, she has been selling sugar cane juice and raising chickens as her main businesses for 17 years. Because of the rain, the customers are fewer than before for her retail business and this is her main challenge.

","en":"In a Mazahua community, a loan group formed called \"Loma del Calvario.\u201d It's members have the liberty afforded by the place where they live. They are able to walk out and admire the green horizon the forest provides. <br \/><br \/>Erika is a representative from the group and she is noticed for the presence that she has: her way of speaking and the certainty that she inspires in the other group members. She is married to Vicente, who works constructing housing in the capital of the country. They are the parents of three children, two of whom are students.<br \/><br \/> Erika dedicates most of her time, after taking care of her family, raising chickens. Since she was a little girl, she has helped her mother to take care of chickens, which gave her experience in this trade. <br \/><br \/>A year ago, Erika requested a loan from VFM\u00e9xico that helped her to buy more chickens and feed. Since then, she has not failed to invest it in that way. Thanks to the support of the institution, Erika's earnings have increased slightly and she has the opportunity to pay for her children's education more easily. <br \/><br \/>Erika goal is to have a farm with more chickens, a more stable business where she can work alongside her husband so that he does not have to go to the capital to work and be far away from their family throughout the week when he stays in the city. <br \/><br \/>When Erika speaks about beginning her business she comments, \"in this life, you can do anything, you just have to want it.\"<br \/><br \/>The other group members are Mar\u00eda Aurelia, Rosalba, Leticia, and Elia who will invest in sheep; Francisca and Fabiola, will invest in chickens.<br \/><br \/>*This image was captured in the municipal center, where there is a pavillion, a Catholic church, and the governor's palace.

She is a mother of five dependent children, two of whom are still in school and one is too young to attend. To support her family, she grows cassava and sells grocery items to get more income. Her cassava has been destroyed by insects and it is the main challenge for her. She has been involved with the cassava farm for 19 years and she can save about 10 USD from her income per day. \r\n\r\nShe leads a group of two who request a new loan with VisionFund and this is her fifth micro loan. She has improved her family's living with decent household supplies via her previous loan and she also pays her children\u2019s education fees on time.

Growing rice on a hectare area of farmland is this family's main business, while growing cassava is the secondary business. She has been involved in the farming business for ten years. She faces a challenge of getting lower outputs from their cassava farm which is destroyed by insect pests.<br \/><br \/>She formed a group of two members to request loans from VisionFund.

years old and has six dependent children. Nowadays, she needs to support the three children who are still in school. The main source of her income is from growing rice, which she has done for 25 years to support her family\u2019s living. Moreover, she has worked for others for a fee to get more income. The rice\u2019s price is lower than last year and this is her main challenge. She can earn about 11 USD per day as income. After her business expenses, she is able to save around 5 USD each day. <br \/><br \/>To save her business, she leads a group of two members to apply for a new loan.

He is married to Roselita, who takes care of their elementary-school children and their other two children who are not of school age yet. They live in the beautiful and most visited tourist spot where most island hopping is concentrated, with volcanic limestone cliffs towering over magnificent lagoons and lakes. This led Randy to go into the transportation business to provide for his family. <br \/><br \/>At present he has a tricycle which he drives within their town. Although it helps with their daily needs somewhat, it is not enough to cover his child's schooling. So he thought of buying a boat which he will use to transport tourists from one island to the other. He expects the influx of local and foreign tourists to spend their Christmas holidays in the gleaming white sand beaches of Coron. In view of this, he is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan to pay for his new boat. He is thanking you in advance for your valued help so he can fully provide for his family. <br \/><br \/>Randy hopes and prays for safe and efficient service for his passengers. He dreams of his business being successful to give his wife and children a good life. He also prays for abundance in their lives. Every week, he faithfully meets up with his co-fellowship members* to share stories of his work and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God he studies. <br \/><br \/>* All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Married to Benjamin, a maintenance man, she has three children, one of whom is in college and one is already working. Making a living in a developing economy is a big challenge but the couple support each other in order to make ends meet.<br \/><br \/>Her husband's income as a maintenance man is not enough to raise a family so Epifania thought of driving a tricycle so she could help provide for their needs.  A tricycle is a motorcycle with a side car that carries around four passengers. It is a common means of transportation in the Philippines and serves as a kind of taxi for short distance travel.<br \/><br \/>Proper and regular maintenance of her tricycle is necessary to ensure efficient and safe service. In view of this, she is humbly seeking your help in the amount of PHP 10,000 to pay for repair, spare parts and maintenance of her tricycle unit. This will help ensure a steady income from her tricycle service and will help fund her child's college education.<br \/><br \/>Epifania's priceless dream is to see her child earn a college degree and become successful in her chosen career.

Zaida is the mother of five children, all of whom are now adults and financially independent. Nevertheless she continues to help them whenever she can. She has been married for 44 years; her husband works as a messenger for a health centre. <br \/><br \/>For Sra. Zaida and her husband to support their five children on a single salary was very difficult, so she decided to work as a domestic servant on an hourly wage in order to bring in additional income. That was how she met a woman, her former boss and owner of a small factory making bed linen, who taught her how to sew. Then she specialised in making items such as quilts, sheets, furniture covers, aprons, drapes, bathroom sets, and pyjamas. She has had her business for 29 years, and it has allowed her to help her children complete their studies; one daughter a year ago qualified as a pharmacologist and could always count on her mother's financial assistance. <br \/><br \/>Zaida's business has also taught her to be economically independent, something that is very important for her. In a side business that is also a means of relaxation, Zaida paints ceramic pieces which then sell very easily. <br \/><br \/>She has a good record with the organisation. Her first loan was in 2008. Now she is seeking her fifth loan. She is noted for her punctuality and responsibility. Her first sewing machine was bought through a loan. The very woman who taught her to sew gave her her first fabric, a box of elastic and another of thread; that was how she started her business.

between 12 and 6 years. She lives alone with her 79-year-old husband. <br \/><br \/>Makhathatso lives in a traditional hut that is not well ventilated, nor warm in winter. Together with her husband, despite the age, Makhathatso works long hours to ensure there is enough food for her family. She has to wake up very early, around 5am, to start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water, and warming the house both for her and her husband. Collecting firewood, setting up the fire, and doing the actual cooking demands a lot of her time. <br \/><br \/>Temperatures in the Lesotho highlands are never really high. Winters can get very cold, and often Makhathatso has to start the fire inside her hut. Starting a fire releases smog and smoke, which when inhaled in large quantities over a period of time can lead to lung diseases, eye problems, and in the worst case, death. In these circumstances, life for people like Makhathatso is very difficult. <br \/><br \/>Makhathatso has requested a loan from Kiva lenders in order to be able to purchase clean cook stoves, which will provide her and 12 other people from her village, who are living in similar circumstances, the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families. It also does not require expensive paraffin and gas, or a lot of wood, which is hard to find in Lesotho. This stove can be started with the use of very little readily-available biomass, like dry twigs and dry cow dung, that does not require lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the home. <br \/><br \/>This stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery, which runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones and a mini LED lamp. It is a life-improving package for these people. This stove saves them time to be with their family, saves energy, eliminates toxic inhalation, and gives them a better lit home to see in the evening while cooking and enables children to do their homework.

Sin embargo, para los habitantes tambi\u00e9n es importante adorar y dar gracias a la Virgen de Dolores. En este d\u00eda, la iglesia principal y las capillas se llenan de asistentes, despu\u00e9s de escuchar misa, las personas se re\u00fanen para compartir sus alimentos y disfrutar un momento juntos.\nEulalia es integrante y l\u00edder del grupo de pr\u00e9stamo, desde hace 15 a\u00f1os se dedica a criar pollos, actividad que tambi\u00e9n practicaban sus padres y que es muy com\u00fan entre los habitantes del pueblo ya que el campo ofrece un vasto espacio para los animales. \nEsta peque\u00f1a actividad permiti\u00f3 a Eulalia apoyar a Carlos, su esposo, con los gastos del hogar y sacar adelante a sus 7 hijos. A pesar de que actualmente ya s\u00f3lo 3 ni\u00f1os dependen econ\u00f3micamente de la pareja, Eulalia a\u00fan contin\u00faa esforz\u00e1ndose por hacer crecer su negocio de venta de pollos. \nCon esa intenci\u00f3n, hace 5 a\u00f1os solicit\u00f3 un pr\u00e9stamo a VFM\u00e9xico que le ha ayudado a invertir mayor capital y tener m\u00e1s ganancias.

Its biggest celebration is on September 15th, the same day as the the Independence of Mexico.  However, it is also important to the inhabitants to adore and give thanks to the Virgen de Dolores.  On this day the main church and the chapels are filled with attendants.  After hearing the mass, the people get together to share their food and enjoy some time together.<br \/><br \/>Eulalia is a member and leader of the communal bank.  She has been raising chickens for 15 years.  Her parents also engaged in this business activity.  It is very common among the inhabitants of the village because the country offers a vast space for the animals.  This small business activity allowed Eulalia to support her husband, Carlos, with the household expenses and to get her seven children ahead.<br \/><br \/>Even though only three of her children are now financially dependent upon the couple, Eulalia still continues putting forth great effort to make her business of selling chickens grow.  It was with this intention that she requested a loan from VFM\u00e9xico five years ago.  The loan has helped her to invest more capital and to have more earnings.  Thanks to this, Eulalia was able to improve her house.  She was also able to repay some pending debts.<br \/><br \/>Just as she did with her first loan, Eulalia will use the money to buy more chickens because she continues working to make her dream come true.  Her dream is to have a farm with a greater variety of animals and to open a small grocery store.  \"It is all a question of continuing with assets and taking good advantage of the loan,\" Eulalia says upon talking about the responsible use of the loan.  \"Many times you want to invest, but one person alone is not able to get everything together.

Estrella manages the finances, deals with buyers, pays the helper-fishermen, and oversees the maintenance of their boats. There are times when their neighbors rent the boats from them. They earn extra income from this. Their livelihood provides for the usual needs and education of their two children in high school and elementary. <br \/>\t<br \/>As Estrella aspires to save more for the future and college education of her children, she plans to buy another fishing boat, which she can rent out to the neighborhood.

It goes without saying that they feel a profound appreciation for the earth which gives them their precious corn amongst other benefits. <br \/><br \/>Lety, as people lovingly call Leticia, is a hard-working woman who is always ready with a smile. She has had a strong appreciation for the countryside, proof of which she decided to start raising animals as she had some land where she grows corn. She takes advantage of the remains of her product together with grass as feed for her animals as she finds it the best way to take advantage of the two activities. <br \/><br \/>\"The more my animals weigh the higher my profits\" commented Lety who loves to make sure of the maximum development of each animal. At certain times of the year the care must be more dedicated as many animals can get sick, even dying. However she knows that from her foundation of hard work she can overcome any challenge that comes along and now with her profits she has a dignified house to live in with her family.

She decided that her life plan was to start her own business and with the help of her relatives and her boyfriend, they bought various merchandise to sell in her home which is to the south of Barranquilla. As time went by, the affluence of her customers increased and her range of products expanded into a new sector; pork and beer. In this way, little by little, her business has strengthened and her aim is to get new customers and increase her sales. She is currently applying for her first Kiva loan through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to buy beers, pork and a new stock of miscellaneous items; accessories, fragrances, clothes and others. With this investment she says she will make the most of the end of year period and boost her sales.
