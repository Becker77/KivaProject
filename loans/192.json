The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

At the time she had been laid-off so she had time on her hands, plus she wanted to contribute to the family income. She began the business in March of 2005 with a little table in her garage and in no time she had many customers since there was no other business near her home that sold food in the mornings. One customer suggested she find a locale on the neighborhood\u2019s main avenue to be better situated, which put her about half a block from her house. Since then she has done even better. Slowly she has financed her business and has been able to buy needed items such as better cooking pots, tables and chairs for the customers' enjoyment of her food, as well as a bigger stove and an umbrella for protection from the sun and rain. She needs a loan of $4000 MXN, to be repaid in 10 installments, in order to buy raw cooking materials such as meat, tortillas, vegetables, French bread, oil, beans, disposable glasses and plates, etc. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pamela Carre\u00f3n, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":287624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy raw materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tampico, Tamaulipas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22.216667 -97.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2009-03-21T05:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T08:59:33Z","rounded_local_amount":435.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037343},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":435.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037344},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":435.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927762},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:20:21Z","rounded_local_amount":435.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927763},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:20:46Z","rounded_local_amount":435.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382827},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:05Z","rounded_local_amount":435.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382828},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":435.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889504},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":435.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889505},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:36Z","rounded_local_amount":435.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63110999},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:44Z","rounded_local_amount":436.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111000}],"funded_date":"2009-03-21T05:42:01Z","paid_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Carreon","image":90574}},{"id":99219,"name":"Alejandrina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alejandrina tiene 58 a\u00f1os, vive en su casa propia con sus 2 hijos y 2 nietos.

She, with the help of one of her children, knits clothing using traditional knitting needles an activity she undertakes at home.  Her love of knitting began 25 years ago when she began work in a sweater factory which was like an apprenticeship for her.  Since then, she began to knit independently, applying beautiful touches to her work.  She has a catalogue of her designs which she always shows to prospective customers thereby guaranteeing a sure return.  She also sells to retailers she has gotten to know and, because she has become a fast knitter, can complete up to 10 sweaters per month.  This is the second time that Alejandrina has asked for a loan from MFP.  She is very eager to continue working with her communal bank since it pleases her and renews her commitment to punctual repayments.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Before her marriage she used to work as a hairdresser. After her marriage she stopped working in that field in order to dedicate herself to taking care of her husband. However, with her husband\u2019s encouragement, she developed an interest in commerce so as not to remain inactive. She purchases thioubs (traditional damask-type cloth) which she sells on credit, collecting payment from customers at the end of the month.

With a new loan for 1,700 Soles, to be repaid within 6 months, she will purchase decorative ribbons to make shirts and other hand sewn products for some children\u2019s playcenters.

But when he started getting loans from SMT two years ago, he experienced a vast improvement in his personal and business life. Today, his primary goal is to complete construction of a house he had started building when rebels from the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) destroyed it. Despite this setback, Mohamed's greatest challenge is lack of capital.

She has a plot of land to cultivate rice to earn her living. Her husband, Mr. Eam Vy, is a palm juice collector who gathers juice to process into palm sugar and wine. Even though they try to work hard, they still earn little income which cannot support the family well. In order to improve their living conditions, Mrs. Sary O. decided to ask for a loan to buy a calf to start a cow-breeding business. She hopes to increase her income after she sells her cow.

This is 38-year-old Frolence A. from Tukuyu. She is married and has two children aged 10 and 18. Frolence has been running a grocery business since 2005. She buys drinks wholesale and sells them retail. \r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Frolence currently earns about $150 USD each month from her business.

Frolence thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":288029,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She is 40 years old, married and has two school-age children. She is from the village of Facoma. Wilma has been in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 9,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2006, Wilma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities. Wilma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase products to sell. Wilma is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offerings. This will be her ninth loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue to pay for the tuition fees of her children. \r\n<p>\r\nWilma is the leader of a ten member group accessing a loan from ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \"ASA Facoma\".\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Noma has 1 year of experience in this business.  Noma needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Noma joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Noma's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Noma M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

They have four children, two are already married and two are still in their care: 12 year-old Pilar and their youngest, 6 year-old Ana Cristel.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that B\u00e9lgica has requested a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.  She is requesting the loan to buy materials with which to stock her small stationery store since there are items that her customers are looking for which she doesn't have.  B\u00e9lgica has owned her business for two years and it is doing well even though there are some things that she still lacks.\r\n\r\nB\u00e9lgica decided to set up her own business, with her husband's support, because there isn't a nearby stationery store where she lives and pupils had to go to another village in order to buy their supplies.  She decided to support them so that they didn't have to travel far from their village.\r\n\r\nB\u00e9lgica re-invests the profits that she makes back into her store since she often sells out of certain items and when her customers come to buy them she has to tell them that she doesn't have any.  She would like her stationery store to keep growing every day so that she can save up and get her two growing daughters ahead in life.  She would like them to receive a good education."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":699792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy supplies to stock her stationery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COPAINAL\u00c1, CHIAPAS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-26T14:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma Belgica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":905.99},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":967.07},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":993.85},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1043.68},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1089.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.01},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.2},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.48},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.71},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.01,"local_amount":905.99,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":929.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850131},{"amount":82.2,"local_amount":967.07,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":991.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292405},{"amount":84.48,"local_amount":993.85,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1019.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160663},{"amount":88.71,"local_amount":1043.68,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1070.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233540},{"amount":92.6,"local_amount":1089.41,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1117.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512392}],"funded_date":"2011-01-26T16:24:07Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":272171,"name":"Rufus","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rufus is a member of Vision group in Faulu Kenya.

Th\u1ecb (43) is a 51 year-old female living in the town of Thanh Ho\u00e1.  Ch\u00fac is the group leader of an 8-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.

The official name of this borrowing group is 05-\u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n (10.05.005).\r\n\r\nCh\u00fac is married and has 1 school-aged child. To making a living, Ch\u00fac owns & operates a business making & selling food.  She sells a variety of food products in the local community.  Ch\u00fac has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 1,000,000 Viet Nam Dong (~$56 US) a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Ch\u00fac joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to engage in business activities.  Ch\u00fac has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND (~$209 US) from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Her previous loan was used to invest in expanding her business.  She is now requesting another loan of 6,000,000 VND which will be used to invest in further expanding her business.  This will be the 7th loan taken out by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Ch\u00fac plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family income.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  \u0110\u1ed7 th\u1ecb Th\u00e1i (50) is a 46 year-old female who is requesting a 6,000,000 VND loan to support her business of making & selling food.\r\n\r\n2.

In response to this, FPW has recently added a new loan product of 6,000,000 VND with a 20-month term to its Thanh Hoa City branch portfolio.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nCh\u00fac D.

Currently all her children are in school except for her last born who is still breastfeeding. She is a trader who sells assorted products like cooking utensils and plastics like lunch boxes, etc. She treks to Kumasi to purchase her stock of goods. She mostly sells by hawking (that is house-to-house selling). She has been in business for four year now. She has attracted lots of customers who purchase from her. Recently she has been facing challenges in her business as a result of inadequate funds to buy stock. \r\n<p>\r\nMary requests a loan to buy more products like cooking utensils which are frequently demanded by her numerous customers. With this loan, she believes she will be better resourced and able to make more profit. Then, she can build a store to reduce the amount of walking on the street required to sell.

She is married and has a baby. To make a living, Foliga operates a family member's business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. Her main source of income comes primarily from planting and harvesting taro for sale. Foliga has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 550 WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Foliga joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Her goal was to help improve her living situation and to increase her ability to engage in business activities. Foliga has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise.  \r\n<p>\r\nFoliga is now requesting a new loan of 1,500 WST, which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment. This will be her second loan from SPBD. Foliga plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self-esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

S. is managing a general store in the village of Rio Del Grande, Enrile, Cagayan. She is 56 years old and married to Julio, a tricycle (three-wheeled vehicle) driver in their area.  They were blessed with five children who are all married.

She is married and has three children, who are all currently in school. Rose has a business running a small hotel, which she has had for less than one year.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help expand her business, Rose has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more things like cups, saucepans and plates. With the help of the loan from BRAC, Rose hopes to generate greater profits and to provide her children with things like medication, food, and clothing. In the future, Rose hopes to own a house.  \r\n<p>\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in

She lives in Sitio Tunga, Barangay Dalingding, Daanbantayan, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and farming businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of about $115. \r\n\r\nPrescila is now borrowing 12,000 PHP so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 12,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Prescila aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is a certified public accountant by profession and a dressmaker by vocation.  She carries out her work from a workshop in her own home.  She learned the trade, which is a family tradition, at the age of 12.  She was taught by her mother who she still works with.\r\n\r\nInitially, Aby stuck on buttons and carried out other simple dressmaking tasks until she set up her own workshop and decided to learn all the tasks involved in the business such as designing, cutting, preparing, assembling and finishing off garments.  Currently, Aby's favorite line is women's clothing.  She faces a great challenge in the form of competition and imported clothes which are cheaper.  However, she is studying the possibility of buying in bulk so that she can offer better quality services with the clothes that she makes, at more competitive prices.  Her goal for the future is to attract new customers, increase her production levels and increase her profits.  For this reason, she is applying for a Kiva loan which is her first loan.  She will use the money to buy larger quantities of fabric, threads, lace, buttons and accessories so that she can produce women's clothing as she has orders for dresses from people who want to look beautiful for celebrating Mother's

He has 3 additional dependents who live with him because they are his relatives.  \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Michael established his rice, wood, palm oil and garri business. He began this business after he retired as a driver from Oxfam.  He now has  something to do even as he is retired, transacting with a lot of customers. \r\n\r\nWorking 7 days a week and 8 hours a day, Michael earns about Le 1,300,000 every month from this business.

their second loan from Friendship Bridge. Gathered in the office in Solol\u00e1, they share about their businesses and dreams for the future.  \r\n\r\n<P>Ten of the women are skilled in beading; crafting beautiful bracelets, necklaces, and earrings from tiny translucent beads, and selling them in the streets of nearby tourist towns, as well as through orders that friends and neighbors place.  They will invest their loans in beads and string, which they purchase from a market in Solol\u00e1.  Olga Tunay says that for the first time, with the help of their previous loan, they were able to buy beads in bulk, which drastically reduced the cost, as well as the number of trips they must make to the market. <\/P> \r\n\r\n<P>Two women are skilled weavers, producing \"huipiles\" (the traditional Mayan blouse) and skirts like the ones in the picture. They will invest their loan in thread to weave these intricate clothes. A single huipil can take up to three months to make, and after an initial investment of $30-$50, it can be sold for up to $200. These huipiles represent a woman's home town, her marital status, and other interests and beliefs.<\/P>  \r\n\r\n<P>Three women have second businesses, in addition to their crafts.  Marcela Y. also raises chickens to add to her beading income.  Elena C. grows vegetables, such as corn, potatoes, and milpa (the leaves that are used to wrap tamales).  And Olga Tunay has a panader\u00eda (a bakery), where she bakes fresh bread daily that is sold to local stores. She is well known in her community and regular customers stop by all day to purchase bread.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>The women are very pleased with the direction in which their businesses are headed, and are now dreaming of the future. Their main goal is \"seguir adelante,\" to keep moving forward, in order to proviD. better for their families and offer their children the educations they weren\u2019t able to have. To achieve this, they hope someday to open stores where they can sell their jewelry and clothing. Olga would like to open another bakery, Marcela would like to raise animals besides chickens, and others would like to begin additional businesses, like raising animals or selling tortillas. They are learning to save money for the future that will help them with these goals.<\/P>  \r\n\r\n<P>The women of Chaquijya Central express their happiness in being a part of Friendship Bridge. They have seen other banks, and are grateful for the low interest rate and education they receive here. In addition to being a source capital, they have also found friendship and community. They are asking for a group loan of 30,500 quetzales (about $4,025 USD) that they will pay back over 9 months.<\/P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4025,"image":{"id":142222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To

H. is a 23-year-old young man who lives with his family in Ningarhar province. He is married and has two children. They are small and don't go to school yet.  Omar lives with his brothers at one home and they support their family together.  Omar is illiterate but he admires educated people. He thus advises his brothers to care more about their studying and to work hard.\r\n<p>\r\nOmar H. has been working as a farmer for the last several years on his own land. He doesn't have a lot of land but he is a very active and hardworking man.  He grows wheat, tomatoes, eggplants, and other different kinds of vegetables.  He takes them to the marketplace for sale.  Actually his current income is just 300 Afghanis ($6) a day and it's too little to suffice for his household expenditures.\r\n<p> \r\nOmar says that he has fertile land in an area close to the city which is a great benefit logistically.  But he is in need of cash to purchase seeds and fertilizers. He has therefore applied for a 30,000 Afghanis loan.\r\n<p>\r\nOmar H. hopes that after a few months he will see a lot of positive changes in his business and thus in his family conditions.  He is also dreaming about enrolling his brothers in private educational schools which are much better than public schools.  He promised that he will repay this loan in 24 months in a timely fashion."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":185428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savory banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces.\r\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week and one employee assists her. Ruth currently earns about $120 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 USD in order to buy rice, beans, flour, cooking oil, and sugar in bulk for her business. In the future, she plans to to open the same business at a new location. Ruth thanks you for your support!\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":288125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy rice, beans, flour, cooking oil, and sugar in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-16T21:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:18Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027639},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:42Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613640},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010719},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:28Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233005},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:16Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664796},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":85933.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105508}],"funded_date":"2009-03-16T21:30:12Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":99267,"name":"Leonel Edgardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Leonel Edgardo C. vive en la Colonia sant\u00edsima trinidad departamento San Salvador, Leonel tiene  30 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ado  y tiene dos hijos, uno de ellos tiene  10 a\u00f1os y otro 5 a\u00f1os, ambos ni\u00f1os van a la escuela;  Leonel se dedica a su negocio que una venta de tortas, ubicado en un peque\u00f1o puesto que est\u00e1 rodeado por muchas oficinas donde los empleados salen a la hora del almuerzo y compran de sus tortas, Leonel cuenta con el apoyo de su compa\u00f1era de vida que le ayuda en el negocio todos los d\u00edas, Leonel solicita un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de materia prima como carnes, jamones, pan.

For 20 years, she has done agricultural work and sold animals, like guinea pigs and chickens. For this, every day she goes to different commercial fairs in towns near her area to sell her animals. During the weekends, she sells her animals in the cattle fairs. Maria buys these animals from a farm, but she also has some animals that she raises. This business has allowed her to educate her son and to pay for the household expenses, in spite of seasons of low sales. Her capacity for trade has allowed her to make the necessary sales to cover her expenses.

He has 4 children and lives with his partner in his own home.  Years ago he planned his future by building five large nurseries from which he sold part of the product and part he transplanted to his own farmlands.  But nothing prepared him for the mosquito plague that would attack the leaves of his crops and he was unable to control it in time losing many coffee beans as a result.  For this reason, his crop yields last year were greatly diminished despite his dedication and hard work.  Despite the sadness, Jos\u00e9 believes that all is not lost because, as he states, he feels he can salvage them this year or next year, perhaps.  However, he also planted some bananas; a crop upon which he didn't have great expectations.  However, it is precisely this fruit which allows him to provide his children with food and schooling.  Since he wants to salvage his crops, he is asking MFP for his first loan which he pledges to repay in a timely fashion since he is very grateful to be allowed to be part of a communal bank.  With the funds he will buy fungicides to erradicate the mosquitoes and, if he has any money left over, will buy coffee seeds to start a new nursery.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":426313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fungicides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-14T20:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1007.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886566}],"funded_date":"2009-11-16T15:41:48Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":156812,"name":"Pita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pita J. is currently in the business of selling food in the market and is requesting a loan to purchase drinks like sodas, water, packed juice, etc., to sell.

She is 37 years old. Jenny is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Jenny owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling cosmetics, clothing and shoe products in the local community. Jenny has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jenny joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jenny is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Jenny from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She owns a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Luafalealii has 3 years of experience in this business.  Luafalealii needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nLuafalealii joined SPBD.This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Luafalealii's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nLuafalealii's Social Metrics provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.9 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Finally, PENYA carries out mentoring and monitoring visits to ensure that the businesses are being run viably. Through linkages created with extension workers and some buyers, PENYA borrowers have access to further training in the production and selling of their produce."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1823636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":["Youth"],"use":"To buy cooking oil, school bags, plasticware, soap and sugar in bulk for stocking her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Goromonzi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":299,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3000,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chipo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":3000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2016-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2016-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2016-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":955,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"refunded","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To improve on the capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":11,"posted_date":"2006-10-31T18:28:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-11-17T14:09:37Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":66.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2006-11-03T14:09:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":5051,"name":"Jahid","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jahid is the resident of Beylagan town.

She will use the money to purchase spare parts to maintain her auto rickshaw. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":237246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Maintenance of her auto rickshaw","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T05:20:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":77.04},{"due_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":75.9},{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":81.34},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":85.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":88.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":91.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":26.96},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":28.47},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.02},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.89},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":26.96,"local_amount":77.04,"processed_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:27:10Z","rounded_local_amount":83.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957868},{"amount":26.56,"local_amount":75.9,"processed_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":82.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228111},{"amount":28.47,"local_amount":81.34,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:09:07Z","rounded_local_amount":88.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423343},{"amount":30.02,"local_amount":85.78,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":92.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116602},{"amount":30.88,"local_amount":88.25,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:52:17Z","rounded_local_amount":95.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011536},{"amount":32.11,"local_amount":91.69,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":99.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595172}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T10:22:08Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":82899,"name":"Agness","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (Greetings!) from Tanzania! This is 42-year-old Agness B. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with one dependent who is staying with her because the girl is attending school nearby. Agness has been running a drink stall since last year. It is said that Coca Cola is one of the most recognized symbols in the world, and it\u2019s true. Even in the most remote villages in Africa, there is usually some kind of shop selling Coke, Fanta, and Guiness. The hot weather makes soft drinks all the more appealing; a very cheap marketing tool! All of which explains why selling drinks is such a popular venture, whether you\u2019re the CEO of Coca Cola, Ltd. in the United States or a micro-entrepreneur in Tanzania!\r\n<P>\r\nAgness works at the business 13-16 hours per day and is assisted by two employees. Agness currently earns about 200 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 775 USD in order to increase her inventory. Agness thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":252643,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

He is 41 years old and went to school until the 8th grade.  He is married and the father of 3 children with ages between 2 and 13 years old.  Only the two oldest are in school.\r\n\r\nAssumane moved to Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, in search of work.  He worked a few years in a residence as a security guard, and he was able to open a stand in the central market of Namaacha.  As such Assumane decided to leave his job and dedicate his efforts on his business.  Today he occupies 3 spaces and has help from his nephews who live with him.  He pays them an amount of 800MT per month.\r\n\r\nWith the first loan that he received from Hluvuku and Kiva his business improved a lot.  Assumane was able to construct a stand at his house to better satisfy the needs of his neighbors and customers.  He works from 7:00am until 10:00pm.  His best products are cigarettes, lamps, glues, electric filaments, and cosmetics.  He earns 8,000MT monthly and is able to save 1,000MT.  He is ready to continue his work thus creating more leisure time for his family.  Besides his children he is also supporting his mother who lives in Nampula, and he sends her 1,000MT every 6 months.\r\n\r\nThis is Assumane's second loan with Hluvuku and with Kiva.  The first 11,000MT were used to purchase products to resell and to build a stand at his house.  He paid it off without problems.  This loan of 20,000MT will be used to purchase products for his stand that one normally finds at home.  He is confident that he can pay off the loan before maturity so he can request another loan to complete his dream of purchasing a car, which will assist him with his daily work.\r\n<br

They will supply themselves with fruits and vegetables in Bamako (the capital of Mali) and the other products in the weekly large market in S\u00e9gou. \r\n<p>\r\nThey will resell all of their merchandise at retail for cash and credit from their homes, walking around the neighborhoods and the other markets in S\u00e9gou to a clientele composed of men and women.\r\n<p>\r\nThey anticipate an average monthly profit of 26,000FCFA, which will be used to repay the loan and to help their spouses provide for their families. Their ambition is to buy a house to live in. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Margot Bonner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":346586,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy a variety of items for their business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayama                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami                            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marama                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Louise            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lalla           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ass\u00e9tou        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":116666.66,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:29Z","rounded_local_amount":116792.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678962},{"amount":125,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":58396.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112696},{"amount":125,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:08:15Z","rounded_local_amount":58396.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028265},{"amount":125,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":58396.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873596},{"amount":125,"local_amount":58333.35,"processed_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:02:18Z","rounded_local_amount":58396.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763306}],"funded_date":"2009-08-09T19:21:59Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T17:02:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Margot Bonner","image":645826}},{"id":123859,"name":"Alba Lorena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la sra.

Grace has been selling electronics like DVDs, radios, televisions, etc., for the last seven years to the local people. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is lack of enough working capital for the business. However she works very hard to keep her business doing well. She is using her loan of Kes 55,000 to buy more electronics to expand her business. She hopes to have many electronic shops in future. She wants to be a market leader in this business.

They work mostly in selling cleaning products, clothing, jams, and custards (flan), hats, food, French fries, typical fried pastries, dressmaking and hairstyling.  The member who was interviewed is Katherine, the education delegate.  In the photo she is in the second row, shown standing second, going from left to right, and she\u2019s wearing a blue sweater. She sells chocolate products, mostly candies and cuchiflis (bars filled with caramelized sweetened condensed milk).  She sells her products in stores and child care centers and has been working in this business for 4 years. She is a beautician and she also does relaxation therapy, shiatsu, and manicures in people\u2019s homes.  Also when she is faced with times of economic crises, she borrows her mother's sewing machine and makes jerseys for a school.  She will use the loan to buy the caramelized milk spread, chocolates, cookies to make the typical candies, and plastic sticks to make chocolate bars.  Her goal is to sell only by the box, because now she sells mostly individually.  Her biggest dream is to have a costume store.\r\n\r\n  Katherine\u2019s motivation for all this is her 2 children, 12 and 5, and her husband, who has been a basic support for her.  What she most likes about participating with Fondo Esperanza is that she has been able to become motivated and appreciate her business more.  She does this knowing that she can continue receiving loans if she is responsible, something that she is always working to achieve.

Ale used to work as a housekeeper, but the pay was very little.  Realizing that her family's expenses were increasing day by day, she decided to find employment that would help her to better meet her financial obligations and at the same time allowed her to spend time with her family.  This is how she started selling sweets, fried foods, soft drinks, soap, etc.  Very early every day she sets up outside her house.  The best sales are on the weekends and during the holiday season as this is when she sells the most soft drinks.  She has been doing this for eight months and is very happy and wants to succeed.  Ale has many plans, as much for her personal life as for her business, however the most important thing is that her daughters succeed at finishing school and to enlarge her sales area.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan that she is requesting to buy merchandise like soft drinks, soap, oil, sweets, etc., and in this way increase her clientele.  With her earnings she will buy necessities for her daughters.

M. is a 61-year-old woman who supports her family through three business ventures: food vending, rice and fish vending and coco wine production. She lives in Purok 6 within Barangay Linao, a part of Kabankalan City in the province of Negros Occidental on the Visayas islands. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard selling food, rice and fish and producing coco wine, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 12500 PHP. She earns this amount because of her hard work and her business acumen; at harvest time, she exchanges cooked food for raw rice from farmers. \r\n<p>\r\nAzucena is now borrowing 20000 PHP so that she can expand her food vending activities. This will be her fifteenth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 17500 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Azucena aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n<p>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Isabel D., 49, knows this, and gives her best to accomplish the goals she has set for her and her family. \r\n\r\nShe is married to Oscar D., 59, who is a cook for their own food vending business. They have six children, with one attending college now. Isabel\u2019s family resides in Ascoville, Malaria, Caloocan City.\r\n\r\nIsabel currently runs a sari-sari (variety) store that caters to needs that are more immediate than the nearest grocery in the community. Isabel has operated her variety store from home for years now, along with her food vending business. With the help of her husband as cook, they cook and sell viand, delicacies to accompany rice, which are usually present in Filipino homes every meal time. \r\n\r\nServing their community with these businesses, they gained regular customers who keep her businesses alive. She employs no one and earns an estimated income of PHP 6,000 a month.\r\n\r\nTo help Isabel continue operation of her businesses, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will use this to buy additional stock for her store and more raw ingredients like meats, vegetables and sacks of rice for her food vending business. She will see to it that her store will not lack any valuable thing that her customers need, so that they will make her their number one sari-sari store in the community.\r\n\r\nIsabel has learned the value of improving one\u2019s business, and thus works to innovate hers. She does not emphasize any problem she encounters but rather focuses on its solution. Goals cannot be met just by identifying the problem, but by acting on them. The most important goal she has in mind is to support her children until their college graduation, with which she will feel most fulfilled.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":700073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional products for her variety store and raw ingredients needed for her food vending business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-01-25T14:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":18.33,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:28:56Z","rounded_local_amount":813.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191396093},{"amount":73.34,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:29:18Z","rounded_local_amount":3254.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195814202},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:37:58Z","rounded_local_amount":4068.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256767},{"amount":73.34,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:34:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3254.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123460},{"amount":18.33,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":813.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194714}],"funded_date":"2011-01-25T15:13:22Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":272219,"name":"Josefina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Given a green thumb, Josefina D. V., 57, aims to make best use of her skills and be a blessing to her family and community. Josefina did not manage to reach high school; nevertheless, the dedication she gave to agriculture yielded a personal success which she can be proud of. Josefina is married to Maximo, a farmer, and they have one child, who now works and has a family. \r\n\r\nJosefina has a farm where she grows ornamental plants and fruits like bananas and pineapples. This farm is located near their house, so Josefina can easily manage it. Josefina has been running this business for around ten years now, and she sees that more years of growth will be added to her business. Monthly, Josefina earns around Php 11,500.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her ornamental farm, she would like to request for a Php20,000 loan. She does so to further help her grow her farm. She intends to use the loan money to buy fertilizers, a crop growth regulator called ethrel, and plastic and wire for the physical maintenance of the farm.

But despite these storms in her life, she is still determined to see her farm yield many fruits and become more profitable in the years to come.

He has been engaged in his business for over 15 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Leonardo joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his business and living situation. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nLeonardo is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to  purchase bagoong (fish paste), rice and soft drinks for resale. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Leonardo from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

However, he has not been able to have any savings from it and now he wants to get married.

Siprin is a friendly member of the community with four children. Siprin lives with her family in a house made of mud walls, dirt floor, and iron roof.\n\nOndati village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from Ondati borehole. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Siprin\u2019s family, and the 13 other households using the local water source, need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nSiprin has volunteered to be the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Siprin volunteered to be the promoter because she wants to help the community to treat water, hence preventing water borne diseases.

These are usually children of deceased brothers or sisters. AID\u2019s and malaria are the largest contributors to the deaths of young adults.

Gulnoza has been in the business of selling woolen yarns and socks for 10 years. She is married and has 3 children. The whole family lives together with their mother-in-law. After several unsuccessful attempts to find a stable well paying job, her husband decided to breed sheep, whose wool Gulnoza is selling and using in socks knitting. Her mother-in-law has taught her to do that and now this is their main source of income. Her daughters also knit socks and help their mother. Her husband and son take care of wool processing, cleaning, and drying. This business involves their whole family. \r\n<p>\r\nGulnoza wanted to use the loan from Kiva to purchase a different kind of wool - angorka, so she could mix it when knitting socks. That way, she will be able to raise the prices of her goods and obtain higher earnings. These winter months are the best season for sales of warm wool socks.

Il est un cultivateur dans le village de GLAHOUNSA de la vall\u00e9e de l\u2019Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 et est membre du groupement  GH MISSIMAHOU DE GLAHOUNSA. Les habitants de ce village font les travaux champ\u00eatres \u00e0 la d\u00e9crue du fleuve ou\u00e9m\u00e9. Leurs terres sont riches et les offrent un bon rendement.  Leurs sp\u00e9culations principales sont la culture du ma\u00efs, du piment, des l\u00e9gumes, du gombo, de la tomate et du manioc. Le probl\u00e8me de ces habitants riverains du fleuve est que, en p\u00e9riode de crue, ils n\u2019ont plus d\u2019activit\u00e9 et d\u00e9pensent tout le revenu issu de la campagne \u00e9coul\u00e9e \u00e0 la consommation. A la d\u00e9crue ils n\u2019ont plus d\u2019argent pour payer la main d\u2019\u0153uvre indispensable pour emblaver la superficie \u00e0 eux disponible.  La pratique dans le milieu qui consiste au bradage des r\u00e9coltes ne les s\u00e9curise pas et les runes d\u2019avantage. Cette pratique est la vente \u00e0 un prix d\u00e9risoire de la r\u00e9colte future a un nantis pour disposer de la somme n\u00e9cessaire aux travaux champ\u00eatres. Fatigu\u00e9s de cette pratique il a sollicit\u00e9 un pr\u00eat de 140 000 FCFA pour l\u2019exploitation d\u2019environ 1,5hectares des sp\u00e9culations susse indiqu\u00e9es.\n","en":"Born around 1975 in the district of Kessounou in the town of Dangbo, Mr. David D. Y. is married and the father of two children who are not enrolled in school. He is a farmer in the village of Glahounsa in the valley of the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 and is a member of the GH Missimahou Group of Glahounsa. <P>\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this village work their fields after the waters of the river Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 have receded.  Their fields are rich and give them a good harvest. Their main crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc. The problem of these people who dwell along the river is that, when the river floods, they have no work and spend on food all the money they earned farming. <P>\r\n\r\nWhen the waters recede, they have no money left to pay workers who are indispensable to help them cultivate the area available to them.  At this point many sell the future rights to their harvest which does not make them any more secure, but only makes things worse. They sell the rights to their future harvest to a wealthier person for a laughable sum so that they have enough money to be able to work their fields.<P>\r\n\r\nWeary of this system, David Da Y. is requesting a loan of 140,000 F CFA so as to farm about 1.5 hectares without resorting to \"futures\" speculation.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":237262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"farming 1.5 hectares in corn and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T01:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":140000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":17500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:25Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821548},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:31Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357814},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:38Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046864},{"amount":54.01,"local_amount":27500,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:19:24Z","rounded_local_amount":27873.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938482},{"amount":49.11,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:48:49Z","rounded_local_amount":25339.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396148},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904025},{"amount":34.36,"local_amount":17500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-20T07:44:39Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126033}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T03:10:04Z","paid_date":"2009-08-20T07:44:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":82915,"name":"Casimira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Casimira is a member of the Magnolia Village Bank.
