is a 30-year-old, married man from Gaza city.

He has to maintain the latest designs, rates and delightful colors of clothing for his shop so that he can maintain the rate of sales.<br \/><br \/>Now the major problem is that the winter season is about to start and he does not have sufficient cash on hand to buy clothing related to the winter season. If he cannot replace the winter season's clothing with summer season's clothing, it might highly affect his sales. He does not want to reduce his sales and his monthly income. <br \/><br \/>Therefore, Kousar has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s field partner BRAC Pakistan so that her son can be empowered to buy winter season's garments.<br \/>She hopes that her son will purchase clothing according to his desire at the right time so he can cope with the market competition and could grow his income as well. He thanks Kiva and its field partner for this support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":33.17,"image":{"id":1996379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is a 45-year-old entrepreneur who takes care of her family while doing business. Her husband, Gilbert, is a porter--a job that requires physical strength because a porter lifts heavy objects and moves stock from one place to another. They have three children who are all studying, one in college, one in high school, and the youngest in elementary school. The bloating family expenses drives Jennifer to venture into direct selling and dried fish vending.\r\n\r\nShe sells undergarments, toiletries and cosmetics from a popular brand, Avon. She also has a rented space in the town\u2019s public market where she sells dried fish. Now that it\u2019s the rainy season and she can hardly afford the increasing price of dried fish, she has to give more attention to her direct selling business. She\u2019s requesting a PHP 14,000 loan that she will use to buy more Avon products. But of course, she will also set aside a supplementary capital for dried fish. If she hears about affordable dried fish, she jumps at the chance to buy bigger volumes of it. \r\n\r\nJennifer prays to God to bless her business and grant her children a good future.

She\u2019s a skilled sewer from Buhangin, Davao City who creates these beautiful backpacks from combined used clothing and new fabrics. She selects sturdy fabrics from worn-out clothes and jackets, and then recycles them into backpacks. She has a caring consciousness about re-use and recycling of products; this is why she ventured into this kind of business. She distributes the finished bags to various stores, and sometimes she accepts bulk orders from companies that use her products as gifts to employees and guests. Aside from this, she\u2019s into buy-and-selling used clothes, which is commonly known in the Philippines as \u201cukay-ukay.\u201d  <br \/><br \/>Carolina is hiring six employees to help her all the way from purchasing of raw materials to sewing, designing and marketing. Her husband, Danilo, is her business partner who assists her at all times. Despite some problems like lack of manpower, especially during peak season, they persist because it\u2019s a very good source of livelihood for them and their employees.<br \/><br \/>Now Carolina would like to enhance her business and buy a volume of raw materials such as used clothes, new fabrics, zippers, sliders, threads, and other accessories for her business. Additional capital amounting to PHP 29,000 would be enough to meet this need. This will not only help her generate higher income and savings, but most importantly, it will endorse the recycling and use of locally-made products.<br \/><br \/>According to her, part of the profit will be used for the training of housewives who want to learn sewing. Carolina is a responsible leader of their community and she initiates the Homemakers\u2019 Livelihood Program. Indeed, it\u2019s her desire to help others.<br \/><br \/>Personally she dreams that her two children will finish college and obtain stable jobs.

These are hardworking women who are doing their best to support their families with their meager profits.  Most of the women in the group make or buy woven items such as napkins and table runners that they sell to tourists in nearby cities such as La Antigua or Guatemala City.  Two of the women make and sell tortillas. Two others supplement their fabric income by selling fruits and vegetables.  <br \/><br \/>A member of the group contacted a Namaste business advisor and asked if they could be part of the program because they felt they needed to know a lot more about managing a business. Namaste will provide them with basic financial training, a business advisor to help them develop and follow a business plan, and a small loan.  The women are very hopeful that these tools will make a difference in their business, their profits, and their lives.<br \/><br \/>Do\u00f1a Fermina is 58 years old, and a single mother with a fifth grade education.

One business is buying and selling handwoven table napkins and the other is selling avocados.  She buys the avocados locally and, very early in the morning, takes as many as she can carry to the large market in Guatemala City where she sells them all in an hour. She then returns home to work on selling the table napkins.  Her dream is to increase her profits so she can do more to help her family. She wants to sell more avocados and to increase the variety of woven products she sells. She will spend her loan buying more avocados and more woven goods.<br \/><br \/>Fermina currently works 224 hours a month and makes a monthly net profit of 4462 Guatemalan Quetzales.

It is most likely a convenience store, but quite a sort of smaller than the usual and offers only limited products which are common necessities such as toiletries, food, instants, beverages and other commodities. \n\nWell, unlike grocery stores, sari-sari stores offer products at a low-cost and in a retail basis which is really an advantage for the customers. Yet, gaining high profit here is a no easy feat when customers credit, delay payment or don't go with the demand. \n\nHowever, Rosalie already learned what to do when situations like these comes. CCT, on all accounts, starting 2013 where she joined as a member, guided her to improve her livelihood. \n\nNow, being introduced to KIVA, she likes to ask help from you. She likes to borrow a loan worth PHP 10,000 that she would use to purchase additional products and merchandise items for her store. With this, she expects to grow her sales and provide a better remedy for their family\u2019s daily living condition.

She has a secondary education and, for the past 21 years, she has been involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, two activities which bring a source of income for her family.  Thanks to her very hard work and determination, Gulbu has come to the point where she now has one hectare of her own land on which she grows clover for resale.  She also has six cows, 10 sheep and two horses on her farm.  Her monthly income comes up to 20,000 som (KGS).  <br \/><br \/>Eager to further develop her farming business, Gulbu has turned to Kiva's partner, Bai Tushum bank, and requested a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) to buy a few cows.

She sells detergents from home and walks around the neighbourhood and to her fellow church mates. Her business has been steadily growing and she now sells a minimum of five by twenty litres of the house-hold cleaning agents. <br \/><br \/>With her husband also self employed and not having fixed employment providing constant income levels, Privilege has to chip in to meet the family\u2019s needs. For her to do this, she needs to increase her income levels, meaning that she has to increase her production levels. It is that realisation that led her to seek a loan from Thrive Microfinance.<br \/><br \/>Privilege feels that the training on record keeping that she got from Thrive is helping her keep track cash movements in her business. With her loan she is planning to produce more products and properly brand her cleaning agents so as to make them more competitive in the market. In future she would like to have a company that produces the cleaning agents and also provide cleaning services to companies."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":1996482,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to

Ella reside en un barrio de Barranquilla en donde se consolida su clientela conformada por vecinos y recomendados, a quienes promueve ventas mediante visitas que realiza en los horarios comprendidos entre 8 a.m. a 8 p.m.  Con el capital que maneja actualmente no puede responder a todos los requerimientos de sus clientes, es por ello que est\u00e1 aplicando a un credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, para invertir en splash, cremas corporales, fragancias, cosm\u00e9ticos, productos capilares y calzado. Su meta a futuro es aperturar un local y comprar su vivienda.","en":"Myriam, 43 years old, is an enterprising homemaker who wanted to have a new lifestyle and thought that with sales she would get out of the routine and be able to generate income for her family, since she is a widow and is the mother of two children. A friend who was involved in sales through catalogs, spoke to her about the multiple benefits that she would get through this massive form of sales. Myriam accepted with a lot of expectations and up to now has nine years of experience in which she has gotten gratifying results. She also sells women's and men's shoes generating additional income. She lives in a neighborhood in Barranquilla where she strengthened a customer base made up of neighbors and people recommended to her, to whom she promotes sales through visits which she does between 8 am and 8 pm. With the capital that she has currently, she is not able to respond to all her customers' needs, so she is applying for a Kiva loan, her first financing that she is getting through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to invest in splash, body creams, fragrances, cosmetics, hair products and shoes.

He currently has two sons and a daughter for whom he gives his best, day to day, to get the needed income.  After fulfilling the call of the American dream, he returned to his family's side.  He has been selling hot dogs and hamburgers from the patio in front of his house for six years.  He has formed a very special work team with his family.  His children take the orders, his wife helps him cook the meat, and he prepares the food.  On the week-ends his hot dog cart is set up on the edge of the community park, which has favored sales and, therefore, his earnings.  \"I attribute the success of my business activity to the seasoning, customer care, and competitive prices,\" he says happily while he fixes his car.<br \/><br \/>In addition to this business activity, he works in the field.  He is a sugarcane producer.  The earnings have allowed him to remodel his house, pay for his children's education, and support his wife's study for a master's degree.<br \/><br \/>The loan that he is requesting will help him to buy bread, meat, sausages, and brushes and paint to provide maintenance to his cart. <br \/><br \/>\"Thanks for trusting us, for supporting us, and for making our business activities grow,\" his group colleagues jointly express.<br \/><br \/>*The photo was take at Bertha's house.

She is married and the happy mother of seven children. She lives in a small rural town. Since childhood Basorat dreamed of becoming a teacher, but she was unable to due to her family's financial obstacles. As soon as she finished secondary school she married and so became a housewife. However, even though she is always home, Basorat is never idle. She and her husband do all they can to provide their children with everything they need. To earn a reliable income for the family Basorat and her husband began their business in animal husbandry. Basorat raises animals and sells their meat and milk. The business earns her a good income. Basorat's husband works in a local workshop, earning additional income for the family. Their joint income is enough for an average lifestyle, but still not enough to cover all their needs. Basorat and her husband would like to buy a few more head of cattle for fattening. To do this she contacted Arvand for a loan. Basra thanks Arvand in advance for the support, which will improve her family's quality of life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1980825,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-10-11T16:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-10T16:10:05Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Basorat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":283.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":294.9},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":302.76},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":308.07},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":316.56},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":329.71},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":334.36},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":345.2},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":350.45},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":365.77},{"due_date":"2016-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":372.83},{"due_date":"2016-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":395.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.34},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.31},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.14},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.46},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.52},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.24},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.94},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.76},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.15},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.25},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-10T14:38:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":960434,"name":"Juanita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juanita is 62 years old, married and lives in San Vicente Bajo, Oroquieta City.

She has been married for 29 years to Miguel, who works as a bricklayer. They have six children together, two of whom are still dependent on them. Feliza has been raising pigs in her community for 29 years. \"I started this wonderful business because my husband couldn't find work back then and we needed to pay for our children's education, plus we had many expenses. I wanted to find some way to help my husband with those challenges,\" she said.<br \/><br \/>Her best customers are her neighbors, who often ask her if her pigs are ready for sale, and if so, they hurry to buy from her since they know very well what good quality she offers.

This time, she is requesting the support of VF M\u00e9xico to buy more feed so that her animals can reach an ideal stage of development, which will result in higher profits.<br \/><br \/>Feliza cherishes the dream that her children will have the opportunity for a better future and will achieve professional careers.
