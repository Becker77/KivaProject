Besides, she has many debtors who just fled and left behind their debts. Sometimes her honesty and consideration for others doesn\u2019t always come back to her.

She will also buy additional products from Avon such as cosmetics and toiletries. Her profits can supplement her husband, Aude\u2019s, income as a construction painter. They are both working hard to support their three children who are still studying. Later on she plans to put up another store beside her grandmother\u2019s house, where she can also entice more customers.  She will be relieved of her children\u2019s educational expenses soon, and she aspires to improve her store and convert it into a mini-mart.<br \/><br \/>She regularly meets with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and also to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God.<br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

At the moment, her sons still live under the same roof as her. She is a grandmother of one child, whose schooling is at her expense as her son does not have financial means available.

She was inspired to get involved in an economic activity in order to provide better opportunities to her young daughter. Her husband sells fried foods and snacks, such as potatoes, flour-based cracklings, plantains, etc. He started out as an employee and now has his own business which is profitable. \"I help him sell the products because I always like to greet the customers with a smile, but I don't prepare the snacks, because I am afraid of the hot oil,\" Claudia mentioned with a smile. <br \/><br \/>Currently they sell on weekends, taking advantage of the wealth of people who pass by their stand. The clientele that buys from them the most, however, has always been the children. With the opportunity of this loan, she would buy more liters of oil, and raw materials.

From the highest point of any of its streets one can appreciate the dam, the rivers and the church, offering a unique and agreeable panorama. The fish and sugarcane harvest are the activities that activate the economy of the region, thus during the mornings one can see the fishermen delving into the dam to be able to obtain the local fish called mojarra. In one of the neighborhoods of said community, a group formed called La Chunca, word of Zapotec origin whose meaning is \"the smallest.\" The members are: Sonia, who works selling clothing; Teodora and Hermelinda, food; Santa, sweets and snacks, while Maximino and Rosa sell tortillas. <br \/><br \/>Since she was a girl, Santa helped her parents sell shaved ice, which consists of obtaining the frost of a block of ice to later incorporate syrups of distinct flavors. Together, they traveled the streets of their community and on carts, they installed all of the ingredients and tools necessary in their activity. \"From my parents I learned the value of work,\" expresses Santa, who, since she was 18, does her work only on board a totally equipped tricycle. \"Now I sell shaved ice to offer my children education and a quality of life different from my siblings and I had,\" she adds.<br \/><br \/>To obtain this refreshing product, one washes the hands perfectly, uncovers the ice block, takes the \"brush\" and rubs this until the frost is obtained, which is placed inside a cup to later ask the client which flavor he prefers. The last step is to pour in the flavor, put in a straw and done - the final product is finished. It's worth mentioning that she has flavor combinations that require a more detailed preparation but without doubt have a more special flavor. This is her first loan and she will invest it in the purchase of water, seasonal fruit, milk, sugar, hot sauce, cups, straws, napkins, ice blocks; well, the high temperatures benefit her work.<br \/><br \/>*The photograph was taken in on the patio of Santa, who is dressed in a blue blouse with pink in the photo, in addition to the members, the tricycle can be seen with which she travels the streets of the community."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":687.5,"image":{"id":1993731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy: water, seasonal fruit, milk, sugar, hot sauce, cups, straws, napkins, ice blocks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Miguel Soyaltepec, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-10-12T12:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-11T12:40:02Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hermelinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maximino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Yareli ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2875},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.88},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.88},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.87},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":687.5,"local_amount":11500,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":11516.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752292057}],"funded_date":"2015-10-17T14:55:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alex Martin","image":1188596}},{"id":960576,"name":"Longdy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Longdy, 18, was an outstanding student when he was in high school.

He is a student of Gavar State University in the faculty of geography. He lives in his native city Gavar, of the Gegharkunik region, with his mother and retired grandmother. He also has a sister who is married and she lives with her family. Vazgen\u2019s father is in the Russian Federation and he works there to support his family\u2019s needs. So Vazgen, being the only man in the family now, feels great responsibility of his family's care. <br \/><br \/>Vazgen, besides being a student, is also a farmer. In his farm he has cows, calves and heifers.

This man lives here with his wife and three sons. In this village, he has large farm with 24 cows and also a lot of chickens. Andrnik sells a lot of beef and also eggs, poultry, milk, macun (national dairy-product), cheese, butter and curd. For all his farm products, his wife very skillfully finds customers. Farming is their only source of income for their living. Andranik mentions that he has been farming since he was a very young age and that many years and efforts were needed in order to establish and keep his farm.

She has a vocational education and works as a cleaner at a notary public. She has also been farming and raising livestock since 1999. Thanks to Kunduskhan's hard work, she currently has three cows.

For this, Gleris operates her business starting at 5 a.m. and throughout the day until 10 p.m. to offer an opportune and complete service.<br \/><br \/>She is now requesting her first Kiva loan through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo [\"The Mario Santo Domingo Foundation\"], which plans to invest in the purchase of supplies such as flours, oils, meats, and seasonings wholesale to get the best prices and a larger profit margin, on top of boosting her working capital to get a better offer and generate sufficient income to provide a good education for her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1993854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"supplies such as flours, oils, meats, and seasoning wholesale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-10-12T16:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-11T16:20:04Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gleris Naida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":860000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":66418},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":77011},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":79321},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":81700},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":84151},{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":86676},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89276},{"due_date":"2016-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":91955},{"due_date":"2016-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":94713},{"due_date":"2016-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":108779}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.17},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.86},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.35},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.24},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.14},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.08},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-21T16:23:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Konieczny","image":null}},{"id":961025,"name":"Ummar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ummar is a maize farmer from Badamasi village.

This is due to the fact that she works on abandoned or no longer wanted household furniture, and then resells them to those who cannot afford brand new furniture. <br \/><br \/>Roselia is a 41-year-old entrepreneur, married and has three children. She resides in a nicely built, high density location of Kuwadzana Extension in the capital of Zimbabwe, Harare. She is a member of Gamuchira Group, which consists of four members who have acquired various skills over the past years and are using such skills to fend for their families.<br \/><br \/>Roselia specializes on buying old furniture such as sofas, wooden dividers, beds, wooden kitchen units, stoves, wooden coffee tables, deep freezers, and upright fridges. She then thoroughly works on them, making necessary repairs and even making changes to the extent that the repaired furniture will have a brand new look. She restocks the old furniture in her place of residence from the various residents in that area who want to change their old furniture. She testifies that the suppliers of old furniture have grown beyond her current capacity, and she is ready to expand her operations if the problem of capital constraint can be dealt with. In fact, she has become so popular that anyone who wants to replace his\/her household furniture will contact her first. <br \/><br \/>She usually hires an electrician to repair furniture like fridges, electrical irons and television sets. She specifies that she is able to hold a hammer and nail in a right manner, making repairs to all wooden furniture in order to reduce costs; however, when pressure mounts she hires a carpenter who helps her out.

It is because of this that Roxana needed to invest in the business, but she didn't have the necessary economic liquidity, so she decided to seek a FUSAI loan to invest in: blouses, pants, earrings, rings, masks, makeup, deodorants, creams, etc. to increase the products in her business and to grow the sales and the earnings as well."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1993880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to invest in: blouses, pants, earrings, rings, masks, makeup, deodorants, etc. for her business selling jewelry, beauty products and clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2015-10-12T20:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-11T20:10:02Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roxana Jackeline ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":68.02},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":69.39},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":73.11},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":74.88},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":77.77},{"due_date":"2016-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":82.3},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":83.87},{"due_date":"2016-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":87.65},{"due_date":"2016-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":90.41},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":94.22},{"due_date":"2016-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.45},{"due_date":"2016-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.02},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.39},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.88},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.77},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.3},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.87},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.65},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.41},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.22},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.45},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-11T10:23:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Hildreth","image":null}},{"id":961089,"name":"Manolita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manolita is a married woman with four children.
