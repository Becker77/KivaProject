With the opportunity to earn up to $2000\/Ha, Samaila hopes to realize better yields and plans on using his additional income to move into a better home with his family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1998277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-10-13T01:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-12T01:20:05Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samaila","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":10969.2,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":10969.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-13T14:42:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":960976,"name":"Zhyparbu","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0416\u044b\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0431\u0443, 61 \u0433\u043e\u0434, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c. \u0423 \u0416\u044b\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0431\u0443- \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u0432 \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0438, \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0441 2000 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c, \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0432 \u0435\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f 2 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b, 10 \u043e\u0432\u0435\u0446, \u043b\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0434\u044c. \u041d\u0430 0,40 \u0413\u0430 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0444\u0435\u043b\u044c. \u0415\u0436\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u044b\u043b\u044c - 13,000 \u0441\u043e\u043c (KGS). \u0416\u044b\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0431\u0443 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0432 \u0411\u0430\u043d\u043a \u00ab\u0411\u0430\u0439 \u2013\u0422\u0443\u0448\u0443\u043c\u00bb \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0432 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0435 110,000 \u0441\u043e\u043c (KGS) \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0443 \u043e\u0432\u0435\u0446 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430. \u0414\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044b \u043e\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u0416\u044b\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0431\u0443 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430.","en":"Zhyparbu is 61 and married.

She is a young woman of 24 with the desire to excel and leadership qualities; she is married with 2 sons. The oldest son, age 12, is in his first year of high school and her other son is a little one of 4 years old. Due to the lack of formal employment and with the desire to contribute to household expenses and education of her child, Noemi sells fish and seafood on the street. She is applying for financing to buy more products in the indigenous community of Lamlaya, which means calm water, located 15 kilometers from the municipality of Puerto Cabezas, to sell her products at prices accessible to her customers from the City of Bilwi. She dreams of setting up a small grocery store."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":263.9,"image":{"id":1994052,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy fish and seafood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Bilwi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":328,"posted_date":"2015-10-13T06:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-12T06:00:04Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celedonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noemi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":758.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":758.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":758.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":758.33},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":758.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":758.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":758.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":758.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":758.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":758.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":758.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":758.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.16},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":263.9,"local_amount":6861.38,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-22T13:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":7285.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752246162}],"funded_date":"2015-10-13T07:44:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Callahan","image":null}},{"id":961227,"name":"Liezel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Liezel is a married woman with three children.

Together with her husband, Bernardo, she decided to start an occupation in order to support each other; and it was thus that they started by selling milk that they get from the eight cows that they currently have on their farm. Likewise, due to customer demand they decided to implement the development and sale of cheese wrapped in corn husks known as \u201cqueso de rancho\u201d [ranch cheese]. They sell on average from ten to twelve pieces per day, which has represented a steady profit.<br \/> <br \/>Thanks to her first activity she decided to start raising pigs. \u201cI like to live outdoors, be the source of my own income and work as a team with my husband,\u201d she said very happily, and she hopes to have a small farm at which to breed ducks, chickens, sheep, etc.<br \/><br \/>She will invest the loan in the purchase of whey, salt, rennet, growth feed, fattening agents, and milk, since fortunately her sales have increased.<br \/><br \/>* They are Las Guerreras, the photograph was taken in \"the bride of the sun\"; Do\u00f1a Daria is wearing an aqua green blouse and flowered trousers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":1994018,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"buy whey, salt, rennet, growth feed, fattening agents, and milk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tres Valles, Veracruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-10-13T07:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-12T07:20:03Z","loan_amount":4000,"lender_count":93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leticia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Enriqueta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teodora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Danyria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaseth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":67000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":8375},{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":8375},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":8375},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":8375},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":8375},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":8375},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":8375},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":8375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1500,"local_amount":25125,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":25126.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752292060}],"funded_date":"2015-10-18T00:42:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Callahan","image":null}},{"id":961239,"name":"Maribel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maribel is 44 years old, married with five children.

So she decided to take a loan from any bank or other financial institution.<br \/><br \/>At this moment Gupteswari came to Mahashakti Foundation to learn about house loan details. Mahashakti Foundation has decided to disburse a loan to her for house construction. From the loan, Gupteswari will complete the doors, windows, plastering, flooring, and painting for the house.

One of them is Juana, whom they affectionately call Juanita.<br \/><br \/>Juanita is a business woman who has earned a living selling different products. However, she has had better results selling plastic bags, garlic and matches which she offers while walking around community street markets. She remembers that during her childhood she accompanied her grandmother while she sold household items. That was where her concern about having her own money came from. Later her neighbours advised her to sell garlic and matches and smiling she says her inexperience with the products meant she didn't make much profit. However, gradually her neighbours taught her how to better make the bags containing the garlic and matches. <br \/><br \/>For some time Juanita also worked running errands and helping to clean houses but she definitely prefers being in charge of her schedule and being her own boss . Thanks to the loan, Juanita can invest more money in merchandise. Her profits have allowed her to improve the roof on her house and made it easier to pay for uniforms for her daughter. <br \/><br \/>Despite the rainy season being a bad time for sales, she will take advantage of this period and use the loan to buy ayates (bags for collecting crops). The corn harvesting season also begins at this time and people use this tool to carry out the work. She will also buy plastic bags.<br \/><br \/>Juanita works every day and thinks about how to grow her business. In the future she would like to sell cleaning products for the home such as buckets and scourers. However, her biggest motivation is to see her daughter have a profession and she will continue to strive to achieve this.<br \/><br \/>The other group members are Celia who will invest in her grocery store; Maricruz, cleaning products; Hilaria and Gabino, plastic products for the home; Audifr\u00e9n, accessories and pans and Ma de Lourdes, in griddles and plastic products for the home.<br \/><br \/>* The picture was taken outside the house of Lourdes and Juanita is wearing white pants and an apron, fourth from the left."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":987.5,"image":{"id":1991761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"comprar\u00e1 ayates, y m\u00e1s bolsas de pl\u00e1stico","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"san antonio Enchisi, Atlacomulco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-10-13T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-12T17:10:03Z","loan_amount":3950,"lender_count":132,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maricruz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Audifren","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":8125},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":8125},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":8125},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":8125},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":8125},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":8125},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":8125},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":8125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":493.75},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":493.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":493.75},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":493.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":493.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":493.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":493.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":493.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":987.5,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:30:03Z","rounded_local_amount":16251.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752292044}],"funded_date":"2015-10-18T11:46:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Thow","image":null}},{"id":956701,"name":"San Francisco Del R\u00edo Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEn una comunidad muy pintoresca del Estado de M\u00e9xico se integr\u00f3 un grupo de personas alegres y trabajadoras motivadas por sus familias.

You can find him every afternoon under the shade of a mango tree sewing or embroidering the orders that his customers have placed.  His neighbors say he has done that since he was a child, and when he realizes they see him, he smiles happily.

The event is a great exhibition of traditional arts and crafts, industry, culture and services, as well as a cattle exhibition.<br \/><br \/>The members chose the name of the group after one of the members that they can always count on, and who invited them to form the association so that they could access a VFM\u00e9xico loan to invest in their businesses. Maricarmen sells shoes and cosmetics; Lourdes sells chicken, vegetables and groceries; Mariana and Liliana sell clothes; Juana sells food supplements; Beatriz sells cosmetics and shoes; Gladis sells food; Maria sells tortillas; Alejandra and Esmerelda sell clothes and handbags. <br \/><br \/>Lourdes is 46 years old. Her acquaintances in her community and her family members affectionately call her Lulis. Five years ago Lulis started selling chicken and her routine changed completely. Since then, she has to get up at 5 am to clean the animals and offer the freshest meat to her customers. The profits from this activity allowed her to start selling vegetables, such as cauliflower, tomatoes, chillies, onions, garlic and coriander. Her customers always ask for those crops so that they can better prepare the chicken meat. <br \/><br \/>Such is the success of her two jobs that she has set up a room at home where her husband and one of her children helped her to install wooden flooring to show off her crops and, to the side, keep the chicken in a plastic container, her scales, counter and other equipment.<br \/><br \/>On average, Lulis sells 10-15 chickens per day. She remembers that in the beginning it was a lot of work for her to learn how to fillet the chicken breast to offer fillets to her customers. She also offers unique service and low prices compared with her competition in the community. Her clients prefer to buy chicken meat from her now that they can also buy the other ingredients they need to prepare their meals.  <br \/><br \/>She will invest the new loan in buying 20 chickens and vegetables (coriander, tomatoes, onions, potatoes) and strengthening her business until she has a greengrocer's shop. <br \/>*The photograph was taken in \"la novia del sol\", Lulis is the one wearing a pink shirt and standing behind Juana who is wearing a lime green shirt."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":993.75,"image":{"id":1994021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy 20 chickens and vegetables (coriander, tomatoes, onions, potatoes)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tierra Blanca, Ver","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-10-13T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-12T18:50:02Z","loan_amount":2650,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maricarmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana Guillermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladis Karina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esmeralda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":44000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2750},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.63},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":993.75,"local_amount":16500,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:30:19Z","rounded_local_amount":16650.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752292062}],"funded_date":"2015-10-18T15:51:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Donna Davison","image":null}},{"id":961417,"name":"Mela Rosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mela Rosa is 47 years old, married and has five children, two of whom are enrolled in school.<br \/><br \/>Mela Rosa is in the agricultural business, raising pigs in the Philippines.

On the way to the members' meeting place, one can appreciate the fields sown with sugarcane and interspersed with other crops such as sugar, lemons, corn and papaya. The workers walk the same path on foot, by bicycle, by motorcycle and once in awhile by car. <br \/><br \/>The group chose the name \"Las Mariposas\" because they feel drawn to, and identify with, the mysticism of butterflies and their freedom.<br \/><br \/>Ana Bertha raises sheep and chickens; Rafaela and \u00c1ngel raise pigs; Nancy and Mar\u00eda sell clothing; Abel C. repairs motorcycles; Salvador sells food and silver; Alicia sells silver; Abel N. works in special events and fashion design; Mar\u00eda L. sells tortillas, and Mayra sells cosmetics.  <br \/><br \/>Abel N. is 57 years old. For 10 years, he has provided waiter services, table cloths, chairs, sound equipment rentals and room decorations for social events. <br \/><br \/>After returning from the U.S. because of health problems, memories of his stay in a faraway place remain; but the important thing is that he is now back by the side of the people he loves. <br \/><br \/>Abel N. is very happy; with his savings and earnings, he bought a house, part of which he uses to store frames, flowers, curtains, vases, chairs, tables and tablecloths that he rents out for events. In the hallway of his house, he has his mirrors, chairs, a dresser where he keeps talcum powder, combs, hairspray, and scissors so he can also offer his services as a stylist. Clearly, as he is constantly out and about due to his job as a waltz teacher, his customers must make their appointments in advance.<br \/><br \/>\"I am happy with what I do, with my family, with the group and with VFM\u00e9xico's loans\". He invested the previous loans in buying fabric, chairs, bases, razors, still life and some other items that he needs for his new decorative creations. At this time he will invest in buying fabric, fake flowers, spotlights, vases, pins and an electric shaver. <br \/><br \/>Abel N. owes his success to his personality and friendliness which makes him stand out and gives him extra strength in his businesses now that he has earned the affection of his customers. <br \/><br \/>*The photograph was taken in one of the member's homes.
