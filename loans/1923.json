She operates a variety store with a small eatery and owns a simple boarding house that she rents out to students and minimum-wage earners. Her boarders are also her customers in her eatery and variety store. However, they are also her usual debtors who request later payment for store items, food and boarding house rental. This practice minimizes her capital, and that is why she wants to avail herself of additional capital amounting to PHP 50,000. She can use it to cover her collectibles, and to buy assorted grocery items, beverages, sacks of rice, and ingredients for her recipes.<br \/><br \/>Lota is a widow who has two children. She was able to raise them well. One of them is already working and the other is completing his college degree. Her children are her consultants when it comes to improving her business.

With the opportunity to earn up to $2000\/Ha, Sabitu hopes to realize better yields and plans on using his additional income to ensure that all his children get a post-secondary education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1998894,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-10-14T03:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-13T03:10:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabitu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":36737.08,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":36737.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-13T02:04:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Greg Gibson","image":null}},{"id":961073,"name":"Azimbubu","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0410\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0431\u0443\u0431\u0443, 44 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435- \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435, \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 3 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0410\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0431\u0443\u0431\u0443 \u0441 2010 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c. \u041d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0432 \u0435\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f 6 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432, 50 \u043e\u0432\u0435\u0446. \u0422\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043c, \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0432\u043e\u0449\u0438 \u0438 \u0444\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u044b \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0415\u0436\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u044b\u043b\u044c \u043e\u0442 \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0410\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0431\u0443\u0431\u0443 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e 13,000 \u0441\u043e\u043c (KGS). \u0412 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0445 \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430, \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0432 \u0411\u0430\u043d\u043a \u00ab\u0411\u0430\u0439 \u2013\u0422\u0443\u0448\u0443\u043c\u00bb \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0432 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0435 50,000 \u0441\u043e\u043c (KGS) \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0443 \u043e\u0432\u0435\u0446 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438. \u0414\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044b \u043e\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430.

Many schools, offices, workplaces, and various establishments flourish in the city, as well as different businesses. Boarding houses, rooms-for-rent, and apartments are in demand because many students and workers come from other towns or provinces. <br \/><br \/>This is the reason why Leonora, 43 years old, decided to invest in rooms-for-rent. Here is where she put her husband\u2019s hard-earned money from abroad. Her husband, Victorino, had to leave her and their children to seek a more decent wage abroad. He\u2019s been away from them for several years already. It\u2019s difficult for Leonora to accompany and guide their growing up children alone, but she keeps on. She has to endure the situation and pursue the completion of her children\u2019s studies so as to pay off the sacrifices of her husband abroad.<br \/><br \/>Besides these rooms-for-rent, she also invested in a rice field to contribute to food production in her community. Now she has to buy palay, rice seedlings, fertilizer and pesticides and she needs PHP 20,000 supplementary capital because a large chunk of her cash was already consumed for the rooms and rice field. Hopefully her investments will give her family enough resources someday so that her husband need not work abroad anymore.<br \/><br \/>Leonora faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week; there she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God.<br \/><br \/>* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Those who live in rural areas are the most vulnerable. Anastasia, a 49-year-old member of the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank, located in the growing town of Los Encuentros, is an example. She married when she was 12 years old and has been married for 37 years. She was not able to attend school at all. <br \/><br \/>Anastasia has eight children and through hard work and dedication, has sent all to primary school. She has been with Friendship Bridge through five loan cycles and has realized increased growth of her tailoring business as well as increased income. Anastasia not only makes men\u2019s clothing as well as the embroidery on traditional textiles, she also has a convenience store where she sells dishes made from her delicious recipes. <br \/><br \/>She is requesting a loan to purchase more fabric and thread for her textile business as well as more inventory for her store. Anastasia really likes her businesses and wants to continue with them until she is 60 years old!<br \/><br \/>For women like Anastasia, who married so young and were unable to attend school, the educational component of the \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program of Friendship Bridge, combining loans and education, is of vital importance. Through diagrams, role playing and games, a facilitator from the organization shares information with Anastasia and her friends about women\u2019s rights, health, hygiene, as well as how their bodies function. They learn about empowerment and self-esteem, setting goals and realizing dreams. They also learn to manage  their small businesses with new business tools like budgeting, pricing and accounting.<br \/><br \/>As the 11 women in this Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cNueva Florecita\u201d  live in Los Encuentros, a town where several roads converge, they have the opportunity to attract customers from throughout the area who are traveling mostly on converted brightly painted school buses from the United States. These transformed vehicles, called \u201cchicken buses\u201d or \u201ccamionetas\u201d bring thousands of people through Los Encuentros on a daily basis. The ladies in the Trust Bank are aware of this and have various commercial ventures including convenience stores, shoe stores and stores selling kitchen goods.

","en":"Dzhumagul is 54 and married with three children. In the search for an additional source of income for her family, she started working in animal husbandry and agriculture in 1989. Thanks to her hard work and constant effort, she has been very successful and now receives a monthly income of 15,000 KGS. She currently has five cows and five sheep on her farm as well as 1 hectare of her own and 1 hectare of rented land where she grows corn, clover and strawberries. \r\n\r\nShe tries to put as much of her income as possible back into developing the business. However, this year she decided with her family's input to build a barn and a bathhouse. She decided to approach Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 60,000 KGS, which she will put toward buying slate, clay, cement and other necessary materials. She will put profits from the business toward further developing it and toward building a house for her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1992446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy slate, clay, cement, etc. to build a barn and bathhouse","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Manas district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-10-14T13:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-13T13:40:05Z","loan_amount":875,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dzhumagul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":218.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-13T13:16:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kat Tancock","image":1418960}},{"id":961950,"name":"Jenelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jenelyn, 27, is a married woman with two children, both of whom are in school.

Her main objective is to make easy, quick and most important, safe money transfer facilities accessible to everyone in the rural communities of Zambia.<br \/> <br \/>Currently, Constance uses the revenue generated by her Zoona outlets to generate capital in order to expand her business and be a source of employment in his community. She already employs 25 people across different Zambian towns. She would also like to use some of the revenue generated to empower herself by finishing her studies, which she is currently doing part time. <br \/><br \/>Being able to run her own business by having been able to open these Zoona outlets has allowed Constance to keep her family afloat, however, she is now looking to build on that capital base and progressively have her outlets become a more lucrative, sustainable business solution. This would ensure the long-term comfort and peace of mind of herself and those who depend on her, including her family as well as a large part of her community. <br \/><br \/>A huge challenge for Constance are the constant float shortages she currently experiences, especially when assisting a client who needs to send a large sum of money. This results in her losing clients to other mobile money transfer competitors and also results in her clients losing faith in her services. <br \/><br \/>On a broader spectrum, Constance would like to be able to give back to her community by not only creating employment opportunities and thus helping others achieve the same peace of mind she now currently enjoys, but also to be a viable, trustworthy alternative in a country where banking is simply too expensive for most of the working class. This would not only save her community member\u2019s time, but it would also lower their expenses as this would reduce the need to travel long distances in order to send and receive money. One of her objectives is to take safe money transfer facilities to the community and clients no longer having to spend on travel would make this a reality as well as improve the overall customer experience.<br \/> <br \/>Zoona has done market research and in so doing have found that the locations in which Constance is looking to open new outlets would be ideal not only for employment opportunities for those communities, but also to generate the traction she envisions for her business.<br \/><br \/>At the present time, Constance does not have the necessary capital needed to execute her vision and objective.

She wakes up very early in the morning and goes to sleep late at night because some customers buy as early as 4:30am or as late as 11:30pm. She has to meet their needs so they won\u2019t brand her as unfriendly. It\u2019s a good thing that her husband, Marvin, takes a turn at looking after her store when he\u2019s not on duty as a collector.<br \/><br \/>To enhance the competitiveness of her store within her community, Analee also sells rice and retails cellphone load. Rice is a staple food and is always in demand, while load retailing meets the needs of prepaid cellphone holders. She has to be creative and resourceful in order to save for her young children\u2019s education. One of her techniques is to give her debtors a maximum of one week to pay their debts so she can roll her capital. But still, many of them can\u2019t meet her deadline because of financial difficulty. As a result, her capital decreases, which is why she needs PHP 20,000 additional capital. This amount will help cover her receivables and she can buy more sacks of rice, assorted groceries and beverages.<br \/><br \/>Analee is a faithful member of CCT Credit Cooperative in Digos, Davao Del Sur branch.

Despite many challenges like tiring tasks and limited capital, she remains strong with motivation to further improve her business and become successful. She lives in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental together with her husband, Edgardo, and their three children. \n\nNow that Lallaine aims to distribute bigger volume of affordable meat within the community, she wants to buy additional piglets, chicks and ducklings that she can raise. Along with these, she needs to buy sacks of feed, vitamins and medicines. She would like to ask for PHP 30,000 loan for this purpose. Later on she plans to renovate the roofing of her pen to better protect the livestock.\n \nShe shares her experiences and aspirations to her co-fellowship* members at CCT Credit Cooperative.

She has managed to employ two of her siblings to assist her in the running of this booth and they have managed to keep this booth running since June of 2015, however,  she is now looking to expand her business into other locations.\nCurrently, Constance uses the revenue generated by her Zoona outlet to pay for tuition for herself and her sister. Constance would like to someday become a qualified teacher as this would help with the shortage of teachers currently being experienced in Zambia. Her sister would like to become a wildlife biologist and Constance is paying towards making this dream a reality. \nSome of the challenges Constance currently experiences are shortages of float and having to pay tuition fees. Float shortages mean that she is unable to service her clients, which results in revenue dropping as well as clients losing faith in her services. Constance would therefore like a Kiva loan in order to boost her float and generate enough capital to expand her business into other locations. \n\nBeing able to run her own business by having been able to open a Zoona outlet has allowed Constance to keep her family afloat, however, she is now looking to build on that capital base and progressively have her outlet become a more lucrative, sustainable business solution. This would ensure the long-term comfort and peace of mind of herself and those who depend on her, including his siblings as well as a large part of her community. \nOn a broader spectrum, Constance would like to be able to give back to her community by not only creating employment opportunities and thus helping others achieve the same peace of mind she now currently enjoys, but also to be a viable, trustworthy alternative in a country where banking is simply too expensive for most of the working class. This would not only save her community member\u2019s time, but it would also lower their expenses as this would reduce the need to travel long distances in order to send and receive money. She would also like to inspire other young women to become entrepreneurs in their own right and plough all that growth and development back into the community. \nZoona has done market research and in so doing have found that the locations in which Constance is looking to open new outlets would be ideal not only for employment opportunities for those communities, but also to generate the traction she envisions for her business.\n\nAt the present time, Constance does not have the necessary capital needed to execute her vision and objective. Connecting with Kiva lenders would jump start her endeavour while simultaneously jump starting opportunities for future employees who are also looking to become entrepreneurs."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1942989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to generate enough capital in order to expand her business into more locations and offer more employment opportunities which are very much needed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Kitwe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2015-10-14T19:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-13T19:20:05Z","loan_amount":3300,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Constance ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":39000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":3300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":39000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-18T02:38:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":962143,"name":"Denis","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Denis is a 37-year-old hardworking married man who lives in Kamwenge, Uganda and has two children aged 10 and 6 years, who both attend school.
