He and his wife Andrea have three children and they are what motivates him to do better each day. He works in the fields as a day laborer but he decided to also open a grocery store more than ten years ago. His earnings from the store together with his wages allow him to provide the best to his family and to pay the household expenses. Most importantly, his children are able to continue with their studies. To start up the store he fixed up a room made of wood inside his house where he made some shelves on top of some tables to display his merchandise to his customers.

Six years ago, with her husband's help, she set up a space in her house to open a grocery store.

old, married, with three children.  She has a secondary education.  In order to provide her family with a source of income, she has been involved in animal husbandry for the past 15 years, having started with a capital of 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has three cows on her farm.  She also has an orchard where she grows fruits and vegetables for the family's own consumption.

63-year-old widow.  She has a secondary education and she has been working in agriculture since 1985.  A few years ago, she was the victim of an unforeseeable event: her house burned down to its foundations and Raima lost all possessions.  Raima and her children had to rebuild the entire house.  Thanks to her incredible effort, she was able to rebuild and to start developing her farming business again.  She currently has 13 cows and four sheep on her farm, and she makes about 20,000 som (KGS) every month from her business.  However, this amount of money is not enough for the family to enjoy a decent life nor to pay for the children's education.\r\n\r\nEager to develop her farming business, Raima has turned to Kiva's partner, Bai Tushum bank, and requested a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) to buy a few dairy cows with their calves.  The profits from her loan will allow her to grow her business, improve her family's well-being, and buy a truck for her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":123.59,"image":{"id":1997449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy a few dairy cows with their calves in order to increase her income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Aravan district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-10-15T01:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-14T01:00:07Z","loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":8475},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":8726},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":8984},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":9250},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":9523},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":9805},{"due_date":"2016-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10095},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10394},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":10701},{"due_date":"2016-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11018},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11344},{"due_date":"2016-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11685}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.59},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.02},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.89},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.99},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.22},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.58},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.06},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160.68},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.43},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":123.59,"local_amount":8475,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-19T13:12:02Z","rounded_local_amount":8493.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752026599}],"funded_date":"2015-10-19T00:43:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":962343,"name":"Tammy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tammy Davis started Unique Styles and Apparel for people who want the boutique experience without the boutique prices.

Philippines. She is widowed and has not remarried, for she has dedicated her life to raising her children. She feels a sense of fulfillment now that her children are already working. Her source of livelihood is her mineral water selling and her boarding house rental. <br \/><br \/>She would like to request a PHP 8,000 loan to pay for several gallons of mineral water. She is glad that there are CCT and Kiva, who support and encourage small businesswomen like her. Her income allows her to live independently and not burden her children with her daily needs. <br \/><br \/>Emerenciana aims to expand her water distribution and boarding house to enable her to save for her senior years.

She started from a small store with an initial capital of PHP 650 that she had in her pocket after her wedding. She invested that little amount into buying consumable goods that are commonly used in a simple household and rolled up her proceeds. From that time on, she has expanded her little business and added on more products such as rice and corn grains for human consumption and now she also sells animal feed.

In the past, he was in the business of repairing and recharging batteries. He gave up that business because the smell of the battery acid was causing him health problems. An ice cream cone supplier was selling his products opposite Jean Edouard's place of business, and that gave Jean Edouard the idea to create his own outlet some 10 years ago. <br \/><br \/>Jean Edouard is married.

Aidai believes that her generation and future generations can make a great impact on it through education and hard work. Her dream is to see Kyrgyzstan well-developed in the future and to be proud of her country, telling its history to her grandchildren.<br \/><br \/>Aidai\u2019s family consists of five people: her parents, herself and her two younger sisters, who are schoolgirls. Her father works two jobs to make ends meet. Her mother has a low-paying job, which earns her less than 100 USD per month. While studying at school Aidai wanted to enter a good university with an international atmosphere, where she could achieve her future goals. She believes that AUCA not only has an excellent reputation and prestige, but also is the best university in Central Asia. She believes that attending AUCA will help her to obtain important skills and knowledge in her field. She considers the chance to study in English and the opportunity to participate in an exchange program as the most important advantages of AUCA.<br \/><br \/>Aidai needs financial support because her parents are not able to cover her university tuition fee by themselves.

She bakes and sells \"kakanin\" or Native Delicacies which are uniquely Filipino, these are sweet cakes or desserts made from sweet rice or root vegetables such as cassave and taro that are slow cooked and usually made with coconut or coconut milk.

Julieta is already known for baking delicious native delicacies in her hometown and have earned regular customers at her community.\n\nShe trusts out of your good heart you could lend her funds in the amount of Php 20000 to pay the ingredients to bake cassava cakes, \"buko\" pies and other delicacies. She is thanking God and you in advance for your valued help. Her earnings will help fund her her child's College Education. \n\nShe aims to expand her native delicacies store and prays for abundant blessings on her family.

I was born and raised in the Dominican Republic where I live currently with my parents and my two brothers, who work growing and selling flowers. \n\nI study psychology at a local University, because I like to help people, especially children and adolescents who have learning problems. The courses based on Psychology are my favorites. \n\nThis loan is necessary for me to be able to study, since in the place where I live there are no sources of employment and I have to get myself to the closest university, which is 30 km away. If I don't receive this loan I won't be able to study, because I don't have the money to pay the transit fare or the monthly university fee. \n\nMy academic goal is to learn a lot about Psychology to be able to help the community and, above all, my family. After finishing the degree, I want to work in an education center in the sector of La Palma de Constanza, since in this place there are many children with learning problems. \n\nTo the people who choose to fund the loan, I will be more than thankful since this loan will change my life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1993713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

The workshop is located on the road that goes to the airport but unfortunately they are paving that road and so he cannot take his wood to his workshop. He has had to close this shop for at least two years, as this is the time that it will take for the road to be completed.<br \/>This is why he is doing work in electrical installations at various construction sites. For this he requires the loan, to be able to buy equipment and machines to use for the installations in large projects. In this way he will have an income to be able to cover the payments of the loan and improve his quality of life."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1996588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrician","sector":"Services","themes":["Start-Up"],"use":"to
