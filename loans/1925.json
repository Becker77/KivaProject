Uganda Martyrs Kyondo School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Uganda Martyrs Kyondo School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

As testimony to this is the \"pretty black one\", as the first steam locomotive is known which traveled the roads of the region.<br \/><br \/>In one of the colonies, a group got together which is called \"Emanuel\" because of the faith their members profess and whose meaning is, \"God is with all of us.\" These members are Francisca, who sells artificial flowers; Elba, household products, cosmetics, and jewelry; Joaqu\u00edn, cell phone accessories; Magali and Itzayana, footwear; Miriam, pastries; Eugenia, jewelry; Algeria, perfumes; Nancy, footwear and clothing, and Mauro, who drives a taxi.<br \/><br \/>Francisca is a great woman who despite her age continues as strong as an oak. The economic situation that her parents lived didn't allow them to provide her with studies. Nevertheless, her enterprising spirit motivated her to start her business. She sells \u200b\u200bartificial flowers, still life, fibers, and sponges for washing dishes. At first, Fran, as she is affectionately known, and her husband were walking the streets and neighboring communities of \"the bride of the Sun\" to offer her goods. After some years, they left this and settled in a fixed location next to the market. In such premises they have remained for 18 years, always offering her customers the best quality and variety of products. \"In order to succeed, God must be with us,\" she says as she smiles.<br \/><br \/>The loans she has received have reinforced her stability as a trader. She will invest this new loan in the purchase of flowers, still life, leaves, and wire wholesale. With the proceeds obtained, she supports her husband with the household expenses and complies in a timely manner with each of the payments for the loan.<br \/><br \/>*The photograph was taken in the business place of Fran, who is wearing white blouse and skirt.

During the festival, they have a small parade through the main streets of the town.  At the end of the tour of the town, everyone gathers at the carnival to wait for the dance to begin.  In the same way, during the election of the queen of the carnival, each candidate represents one of the ethnic groups wearing typical clothing emphasizing the folklore of each region.\r\n\r\nIn one of these neighbors is the group that goes by the name Guadalupe Victoria, who is a celebrated character of the independence.  The group is made up of the following members: Abelina and Rosa who work selling footwear; Imelda and Sivestra, typical food; Georgina and Lucelly, groceries; Victoria, tortillas; Ismael, fumigants; Yesenia and Yolzin, cosmetics; and finally, Mariano who does tailoring.\r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Geogine is a very happy woman who has formed a very united family together with her husband Roque and their three daughters, who also have young daughters of their own.  In her neighborhood, every knows her as Geo, and she decided to start a grocery store from her home; since, previously, the inhabitants had to go to the downtown of the city if they wanted to buy any products.  In the beginning she displayed the merchandise on a table and the soft drinks in her refrigerator.  As time passed, she increased her space and now she displays the merchandise on shelves and on a big table full of candies, eggs, scales, etc.  \r\n\r\nOne should note that the loans that VF M\u00e9xico has granted to her have been useful to her.

With this loan she would be able to buy milk, sugar, crackers, rice, soup, beans, corn, oil, cheese, eggs, tomatoes, chilies, onion, cilantro, cabbage, carrots, lemon, and squash, continuing to expand her stock.  She says that, \"I am happy for the family that God has given me, for my job, and for the great group that we have made.\"\r\n\r\n* The photograph was taken in do\u00f1a Geo's store.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

The members chose the name since the VFM\u00e9xico loans mean an opportunity for growth in their businesses: Emelia to invest in her grocery store, Ram\u00f3n in tortillas; Rita and Soledad in soft drinks; Hortencia in selling mojarra fish; Cleofas and Ver\u00f3nica in sweets; Brigida in snacks; Guadalupe in chicken; and Manuela in her cosmetology business. <br \/><br \/>Emelia is 51 years old, married to Ces\u00e1reo and they are parents of 6 children who have given them grandchildren who bring joy to the house. Emi, as she is known, has dedicated 20 years of her life to selling groceries. Her small store is located in her house, in a small room where she shows her merchandise on iron shelves. On the bar they have as a counter, she has a plastic container and a scale since the earnings she has gotten have allowed her to begin to sell chicken, as well as making and selling mole sauce. Upon opening the cover of the container, the smell is pleasant and one gets a craving for chicken mole enchiladas.<br \/><br \/>Emi's store has been in service for 20 years from 7:00 in the morning to 8:00 at night from Monday to Sunday. When she goes out, her daughters take over the business. Two times a week, among the 5 of them, they make and sell corn tamales, rolls, chancletas [stuffed chayote squash] and tamales rancheros which they also sell. <br \/><br \/>\"I am a full and happy woman, I thank God for the great family He has given me and for allowing me to form a great team with it,\" Emi says emotionally. The earnings she gets have allowed her to support her husband with the household expenses, to provide her children with an education, begin other work, cover her personal expenses, replace her stove, refrigerator and television and purchase a washing machine. In addition, Emi says that the store is the legacy that she created for her daughters and she hopes that the business can continue from generation to generation. <br \/><br \/>The new loan will be invested in rice, beans, sugar, milk, coffee, soft drinks, cookies, and snacks to continue with her work as she has been doing to date. <br \/><br \/>\"Thank you for each offered opportunity with a new loan, God bless you,\" the group says in an expression of gratitude. <br \/><br \/>*The photo was taken in the small store owned by Emi, who is wearing a yellow blouse and shows her mole sauce in a pot."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":297,"image":{"id":1994010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase rice, beans, sugar, milk, coffee, soft drinks, cookies, and chips.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Miguel Soyaltepec, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-10-15T23:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-14T23:40:04Z","loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramon ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rita De Casia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hortencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cleofas ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":46000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4879.32},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5045.98},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5350.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":5556.29},{"due_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":5829.01},{"due_date":"2016-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6176.35},{"due_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":6418.27},{"due_date":"2016-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":6744.01}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":297},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":307.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325.7},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":338.21},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":354.81},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375.95},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390.68},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":410.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":297,"local_amount":4879.32,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T19:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":4905.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752292061}],"funded_date":"2015-10-26T13:24:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Wendy Harris","image":null}},{"id":960514,"name":"Dorothy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dorothy is a married woman.

This is Justus. He is the head teacher of Ntungamo Girls High School, a girls school in the Rural area of Ntungamo with 450 students. Ntungamo Girls School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 1,000 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Ntungamo Girls School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Justus ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2000489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ntungamo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.916667 30.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-10-15T23:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-14T23:40:10Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ntungamo Girls School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5160000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1032000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":285}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-16T10:24:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":953048,"name":"Famille Sasita Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Avec le cr\u00e9dit pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, Habimana a entretenu son champ.

Sundar works hard to make life comfortable for her family. But she has realized that the income from her husband\u2019s work does not suffice to sustain her entire family. With the household expenses rising as her children grow, she is finding it hard to make ends meet. <br \/><br \/>Sundar has decided to start a sewing business of her own so that the income from her business can supplement the income from her husband\u2019s work. She plans to stitch frocks, Punjabi dresses, etc. She is confident that her new business will help her increase her household income. She expects her monthly income to increase by Rs. 2,000.

Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Top Care School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

As Haiti has only one plant of detergent manufacturing, the Haitian population, regardless of social class, consumes detergent coming from DR for the most part. Saint-Felix would like to reverse this trend and have the population consume homemade detergent.<br \/><br \/>Saint-Felix's strength relies on the laundry and household cleaning detergents he produces. Actually, he has started to make a difference in the suburb of Petionville where he sells his products. If Saint-Felix finds more capital, he will increase his detergent production by 60% and also sell natural flowers. Moreover, Saint-Felix plans to hire three young people he trained in the field.

It is in these social groups that people\u2019s talents are nurtured and potential realised.  Jean did not anticipate that as the youngest member of Sinikiwe group she would be chosen as their leader. Her fellow group members - all mothers to her as they are the same age as her parents - look up to her and believe in her leadership abilities.  They saw in her a woman with strength of personality, vision and integrity. They saw a leader who had the potential to marshal them towards the attainment of their goals. Jean is in a group called Sinikiwe group which consists of four ladies based in Harare\u2019s oldest township Mbare. The group joined the Thrive program in August 2015 and completed the trainings course coming out better business women.\n\nJean is happily married to a man who supports her in every possible way to achieve her dreams. This wonderful family support has managed to make her establish a good poultry business and be a zealous business woman. Her business has helped her manage to supplement her husband\u2019s income providing food, clothes, and paying school fees for her children. She has helped raise their standard of living and they are emulated by people in her neighbourhood. \n\nOne year while Jean was in Zambia buying clothing for her family an idea rang in her mind. She thought she could add another line to her business by buying clothing from neighbouring countries for resale in Zimbabwe.  She saved her profits from the chicken business to venture into a new market. She bought a few pairs of shoes and clothes for resale. She got quick returns from the sale of clothing and decided to fully venture into the cross border business so as to increase her income levels. She realised she can increase her profit from doing this. She has made several business cycles from buying and reselling clothes from Zambia and this has been working out well. She recently started experiencing capital constrains as the market for clothing is getting bigger. She can`t afford to sacrifice the working capital she has for the poultry business. This is what made her apply for a loan of $350 to help her increase her working capital from Thrive Microfinance."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2000429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to supplement income from her poultry business with the sale of clothes & shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-10-16T14:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-15T14:10:05Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jean","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":208.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-21T14:06:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":963091,"name":"Isabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Isabel is requesting a loan of $600 to improve her business.

She is married.  Both she and her husband work as tailors.  They live with their 2 children, one of whom works and the other still goes to school.   They had 3 children but one died of a terminal illness.  When a program came to her community through the mayor's office, teaching jobs such as tailoring, pastry making, and jewelry making, among others, Mar\u00eda got excited and quickly learned about tailoring.  She later taught it to her husband, who at that time was a mason's assistant.  He too was interested, and learned quickly.
