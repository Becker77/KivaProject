She didn't finish school because from a very young age she began to work helping her parents.  She only went to elementary school.  She says that as a young girl she suffered a lot, as she came from a large, humble family.  She had many siblings, who also dropped out of school due to lack of economic resources.  She says that her father died when she was very young, leaving them alone.  She, as the oldest sister, had to work to help her mother be able to move her siblings forward until they were older and could be responsible for themselves.<br \/><br \/>When she was 38 years old she married Juan, and they had two children.  She wanted to have more, but her age precluded her from having more children.  That's why she works.  She wants to succeed in order to give her children a better future.

The members know each other, are responsible, and have different businesses. One of the members is Gina, 31, who lives with her two children who are minors. <br \/><br \/>Years ago, Gina worked as a receptionist at a hotel in the area, but after seeing that she was neglecting her family, she decided to open her own business. Thus, she currently sells snacks such as cookies, candy, fruit, gum, etc., in the city's park in the afternoon. One of Gina's goals is for her daughter to continue her studies. <br \/><br \/>The loan that Gina is requesting will be used to buy goods such as cookies, candy, fruit, gum, etc. In the photo, Gina is the one wearing a blue polo and black pants. She feels very happy about receiving support from Kiva."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":279.38,"image":{"id":1996959,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy goods such as cookies, candy, fruit, gum, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Satipo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2015-10-16T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-15T21:20:02Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ivan Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Madelay Estrella","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dionisia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cleta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gina Margot","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":884},{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":884},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":884},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":884},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":884},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":880}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":279.38},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":279.38},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":279.38},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":279.38},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.37},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":279.38,"local_amount":884,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:56:30Z","rounded_local_amount":896.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752308240}],"funded_date":"2015-10-25T04:22:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Eddy","image":1377564}},{"id":962498,"name":"Merlin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlin is 58 years old; she's married and has 2 children to provide.She has been selling fish for many years.

Cholponai has higher education, works as a kindergarten teacher, and also breeds livestock. She has a developed farm with 30 sheep, and she cultivates feed for the animals on a land plot.

Each one knows that a good education will help their children have a more brighter and successful future. <br \/> <br \/>Elvira is 38 years old with six children and wants them to have a good education because she was unable to attend a single year of grade school.  In spite of her lack of formal education, Elvira is intelligent and resourceful and looking for different strategies to increase the productivity of her produce and animal husbandry business.

It\u2019s quite refreshing during dry season with hot weather, and it\u2019s also appealing even during rainy season. <br \/><br \/>Lydia, from Bacolod City, Negros Occidental, chose to venture into ice cream making many years ago. She took advantage of the good supply of fruits in their place and made it into delicious ice cream. She was able to improve her business and is now capable of helping eight ice cream vendors. Ice cream vendors are commonly seen with movable carts roving in different communities, either urban or rural. They use a ringing bell to call the attention of the residents to buy from them. <br \/><br \/>Lydia would like to buy another cart and employ another vendor soon. She also needs additional supplies of fruits, milk, and other ice cream ingredients. She appeals for a PHP 30,000 loan for this purpose. Additional income that will be derived from this will continuously provide for her family\u2019s daily needs and the needs of her eight vendors. <br \/><br \/>Lydia is married to Edgardo.

As a small girl she watched women in her village form groups so as to access loan facilities. The memory of this collective effort led her to join Kibora tall tree self-help group. For the past year, Dolphina has been actively involved in mixed farming. Because she is from a remote village women do the heavy work in the field. This has not been a setback because Dolphina has been making great profits in farming. Kitale is one of the places with conditions that favor horticulture farming: good climate, soils, transport system, and market. <br \/><br \/>Dolphina has always wanted to diversify and start horticultural farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is lack of funds. She is therefore requesting a loan to start horticultural farming. Through the Kibora tall tree self-help group, whose members co-guarantee each other to secure a loan, Dolphina joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance organization that supports young and enterprising farmers. With your loan Dolphina intends to buy good quality vegetable seeds, flowers and potatoes. Proximity to an airstrip will allow her to transport the produce faster to an international market, hence enabling her to make more money. This loan will improve Dolphina's living conditions and secure the future of her children. The difficult circumstances that Dolphina has been through and her drive to overcome them, make her deserving of the help she requests."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":78.96,"image":{"id":1976254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to start horticulture farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-10-17T15:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-16T15:50:12Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dolphina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3519.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3622.53},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3728.4},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3837.36},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3949.51},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":4064.93},{"due_date":"2016-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4183.73},{"due_date":"2016-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4306},{"due_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4431.84},{"due_date":"2016-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4561.36},{"due_date":"2016-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4694.67},{"due_date":"2016-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4831.87},{"due_date":"2016-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4973.08},{"due_date":"2016-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5118.42},{"due_date":"2016-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5268.01},{"due_date":"2017-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5421.96},{"due_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5580.42},{"due_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5743.51},{"due_date":"2017-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":5911.3},{"due_date":"2017-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":6084.12},{"due_date":"2017-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":6261.93},{"due_date":"2017-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":6444.94},{"due_date":"2017-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":6633.29},{"due_date":"2017-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":6827.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.73},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.72},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.73},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.77},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.09},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.27},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.47},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.71},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.99},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.31},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.66},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.05},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.96},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.48},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.04},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.65},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.31},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.01},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.76},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.57},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":78.96,"local_amount":8239.79,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":8339.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112563}],"funded_date":"2015-10-19T19:36:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":946231,"name":"Mwiti","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwiti (left) is a 28-year-old smallholder farmer based in central Kenya.

For the past 5 years she has been involved in mixed farming and her main source of income has been growing maize, vegetables, and tomatoes. She also keeps dairy cows. Janet has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. <br \/><br \/>Although she has made profits selling a variety of food crops, Janet is faced with the challenge of timely delivery of produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. She mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that helps aspiring women like her. <br \/><br \/>Janet is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. She is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to market has been a challenge, which is why she has suffered so many losses. Perishable products such as milk, vegetables, and tomatoes require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price, and through this loan Janet is going to achieve her dream and goals. <br \/><br \/>Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Janet feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help women so that they can gain respect and equality. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Janet will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market.

Meet Mary, a 34-year-old mum who is a humble, honest and very hardworking mother on this planet Earth. Mary is a mother of seven lovely children whom she really adores so much and will always do anything good so that they never go to bed with hungry stomachs. <br \/><br \/>Mary hails from the Kitale area of Kenya. Mary never got the opportunity to advance her education and get a white-collar job, but this did not kill her dream of wanting to succeed in life. Mary started farming and has been doing farming for the past six years. Throughout those years, she has gathered so much experience and all the farming techniques are at her fingertips. <br \/><br \/>Mary practices mixed farming on her farm and through the profits, she has managed to take care of her family's needs and give her children a good education because she believes that education is the only \u201ckey to success\u201d. <br \/><br \/>Mary is a mum who is very enterprising. She is seeking a loan of KES 40,000 to start horticulture farming on her farm. Because of favourable weather patterns, a good road network in her village, good soil and a ready market for horticultural products, Mary wants to take advantage of that and reap more profits. Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring mums like Mary to make their farming dreams become reality through training and loan financing. <br \/><br \/>Mary hopes that through the loan, she will improve her living conditions. Mary's dreams and projections are that by the end of the first year, she will not only be selling in the local market, but will also be selling in international markets through exporting fruits and vegetables. Through this, she will be able to assure her children a secure future and uninterrupted learning because she will be able to pay tuition fees on time. <br \/><br \/>Mary is not a selfish woman and will also want to impact positively on society.

Meet Catherine, a 42-year-old farmer from the remote village of Sikhendi, situated in the Rift valley province of Kenya. The living conditions in this area are tough, because there is neither clean water nor electrical connections. Catherine lives with her lovely family on a small piece of land where she keeps dairy cows and poultry and grows a wide variety of crops. For 10 years, her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs and horticultural produce. <br \/><br \/>Catherine's biggest challenges are disease and a shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs such as chemicals to prevent these diseases. Catherine made the decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help her improve her farming activities. Sometime this month, she applied for a loan to build a fishpond.  The Sikhendi area has a ready market for fish. The only challenge is lack of supply, and through this loan she will be able to tackle the problem. The Kenya government is promoting fishpond development, because they provide a source of food from the sale of fish for small farmers and can also supply irrigation needs and water for livestock. <br \/><br \/>The additional income from the selling of fish will go to her children's education. The cost of education in Kenya is becoming prohibitive for low-income communities, especially in the rural areas. As a result, kids are forced to drop out and start working to contribute their earnings to their families. With your loan, Catherine\u2019s children will acquire a quality education that will act as a strong foundation for a bright future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":56.2,"image":{"id":1979269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to start a fish farm by building a fishpond.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-10-17T17:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-16T17:20:03Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2477.05},{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2549.45},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2623.95},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2700.6},{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2779.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2860.8},{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2944.4},{"due_date":"2016-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3030.45},{"due_date":"2016-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3119.02},{"due_date":"2016-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3210.17},{"due_date":"2016-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3303.99},{"due_date":"2016-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3400.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.77},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.49},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.01},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.8},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.61},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.44},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.3},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.19},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.1},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.04},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":56.2,"local_amount":5619.79,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:30:00Z","rounded_local_amount":5935.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112609}],"funded_date":"2015-10-17T18:44:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":948340,"name":"Carolyne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carolyne is a 30-year-old mother with a beautiful family.

She is an extraordinary woman with a great personality.  At a time when many farmers in Kenya are abandoning dairy farming and agriculture owing to poor yield and low income, Salina, hailing from Kapsowar, is scripting a success story with her dairy farming. She is a role model, a mentor, and an inspiration to many young farmers in her village because of her resilience despite personal challenges and her passion to support her children as a primary caregiver. For the past five years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been growing maize, cabbage, and tomatoes and keeping dairy cows. Salina has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. After she lost her formal job, the role of primary caregiver of the family has been overwhelming because of the responsibility of feeding the whole family. This challenge has not made him give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family,\"s he said. <br \/><br \/>Salina is requesting a loan to buy an additional quality dairy cow and to build a modern dairy unit. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profits and increased income levels. The profit from selling milk will be used in repaying the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. Salina is very visionary, and she intends that in the near future, she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling it.

This is all because she wants to achieve her dream of giving her children a good education. Ann is a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman from the Nandihills area of Kenya, near the famous Rift valley escarpments. \n\nAnn has been farming for the past 10 years. Over the years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, maize, crops and some small business ventures(a shop she runs) that help her make ends meet. \n\nAnn is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plough. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. \n\nKenya's Nandihills area, one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Ann could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. Accessing funds has been a challenge for Ann, but she now feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. \n\nAnn believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals.

This mother of one, keeps dairy animals and grows maize and vegetables. She has five years of experience in farming. <br \/><br \/>Mercy is seeking a loan to expand with horticulture farming. She is very hardworking and determined to increase her farm's output. Loans for smallholder farmers with little irregular income and no solid collateral, are hard to come by in Kenya. Few organizations such as Juhudi Kilimo support farmers like Mercy. Through a group of 15 members called Koronga, Mercy has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi, which use the group-based savings as collateral. According to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled. <br \/><br \/>Mercy is kindly seeking for a loan to start horticulture farming. Because of the favorable weather and road conditions she will have an easy time transporting her horticulture products to the market. In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household. Juhudi Kilimo facilitates loans that empower smallholder farmers like Mercy, because the institution believes that women too, are actively involved in various segments of the horticultural industry. <br \/><br \/>Mercy dreams big and wants to accomplish big things with her business and in her life. She wants to buy a new house so that her family can have a good quality life and also to pay school fees for her children. You can help Mercy with all these dreams and goals so that she can achieve them; a loan will get her so much closer."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":44.79,"image":{"id":1979807,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to start horticulture farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-10-17T17:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-16T17:50:06Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2016-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2016-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2016-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5503.14},{"due_date":"2016-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5829.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":44.79,"local_amount":4673.22,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:30:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4730.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112614}],"funded_date":"2015-10-25T00:30:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":960827,"name":"Jose Pablo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9 es un orgulloso ganadero de 53 a\u00f1os de edad, un hombre que vive y siente el campo, hered\u00f3 de su padre su pasi\u00f3n y los terrenos en los cuales se dedica a la cr\u00eda de ganado, actividad que se ha pasado de generaci\u00f3n en generaci\u00f3n y la cual espera que ejerza su hija.\nEs separado, se preocupa por mantener su hogar y enviar el dinero para alimentar a su hija.\nJos\u00e9 toda la vida ha tenido que convertir contra sus vecinos por vender ganado, esto se ha vuelto una verdadera guerra campal, puesto que los precios son bastante dif\u00edciles de sostener.\nJos\u00e9 pensando en ser m\u00e1s competitivo y no dejarse vencer y achicopalar por la competencia, quiere solicitar un apoyo econ\u00f3mico para la compra de 4 terneras, vacunas, alimento y alimento de engorde.\nSue\u00f1a con tener un gran negocio, rodeado de muchos empleados.\n","en":"Jos\u00e9 is a 53 year old proud cattle rancher.

She and her 3 group members of Professional Ladies reside in a well-constructed suburb of Kuwadzana Extension in the capital of Zimbabwe, Harare.\n Krevy started venturing into various businesses when she was a girl 19 years of age in 1998. By then she had a vegetables stall located along the roadside outside her parents place and also in addition to that she used to go to South Africa as a cross border trader restocking clothes and shoes and selling them in Zimbabwe. Throughout the years Krevy acquired invaluable experience on managing her business.\nIn 2012 Krevy ventured into hardware business selling cement, taps, water piping system, electricity cables and piping system, paint, doors and door handles. She ventured in than line of business because the margins of running a vegetable stall had dropped significantly due to the intense competition since others were entering into vegetable selling. An additional reason is that the location of Kuwadzana Extension is still being extended to accommodate more inhabitants hence a need for cement, doors, bricks and taps to build proper place to reside in. This is works to the advantage of Krevy as she is confident that her sales will be high since there is greater demand for hardware products. Krevy restocks her hardware from the central business district of Harare and she hires a carpenter who manufactures the doors according to clients\u2019 specific order.\nKrevy require a loan of $500 in order to build a proper hardware shop so that her products will not be subject to different harsh climatic conditions such as intense heat and rain.

Lydiah's biggest challenges are disease and a shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs such as chemicals to prevent these diseases. Lydiah made the decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help her improve her farming activities. <br \/><br \/>Sometime this month, she applied for a loan for buying seeds to expand her horticulture farm. This will enable her to expand her operations and increase her overall output. The additional income from the expansion will go to Lydiah's children's education. The cost of education in Kenya is becoming prohibitive for low-income communities, especially in the rural areas.

It also has a lot of smallholder farmers who work the land and raise animals. Unfortunately, the people who do this work face many problems, like the high costs of the inputs, the weather or bad seasons. Susan is aware of these issues but always finds a way to come through. <br \/><br \/>Susan is from a remote village in the Kapsowar area of Kenya and she is elegant and admirable in spirit and effort. She is a role model, a mentor and an inspiration to many young farmers in her village because of her resilience despite personal challenges and her passion to support her six children as the primary caregiver. For the past 10 years she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been growing maize, vegetables and also keeping dairy cows. Susan has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. After her husband lost his formal job, the role of primary caregiver of the family fell to Susan. It has been overwhelming because she now has to shoulder the responsibility of feeding the whole family. This challenge has not made her give up. \u201cI have to do something for my family,\" she said. <br \/><br \/>Susan is requesting a loan to buy an additional quality dairy cow and to build a modern dairy unit. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10 and 15 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profits and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used in repaying the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. <br \/><br \/>Susan is very visionary, and she intends that in the near future, she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling it. She will also start selling dairy products such as yoghurt. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets. <br \/><br \/>Susan believes that if female smallholder farmers had the same access to credit facilities as men, the number of the world's hungry could be reduced by a significant margin. Be inspired to loan to her today to keep her big smile!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":49.26,"image":{"id":1979917,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality dairy cow and build a modern dairy unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-10-17T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-16T18:50:03Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":93100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4004.05},{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4121.07},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4241.51},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4365.47},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4493.05},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4624.36},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4759.51},{"due_date":"2016-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4898.6},{"due_date":"2016-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5041.76},{"due_date":"2016-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5189.11},{"due_date":"2016-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5340.76},{"due_date":"2016-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5496.84},{"due_date":"2016-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5657.49},{"due_date":"2016-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5822.83},{"due_date":"2016-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":5993},{"due_date":"2017-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":6168.15},{"due_date":"2017-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":6348.49},{"due_date":"2017-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":6533.95}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.84},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.2},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.43},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.7},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.01},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.36},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.74},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.16},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.63},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.14},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.69},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.29},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.94},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.63},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.37},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":49.26,"local_amount":5095.41,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T16:30:02Z","rounded_local_amount":5204.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752112618}],"funded_date":"2015-10-28T10:30:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":952848,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose is an ambitious woman and looks to a future when she is the leading supplier of horticulture products.

Her primary sources of income have been from planting milk, eggs and a variety of crops. She also engages in some personal business to make ends meet. Jecinta passionately loves farming.  She got interested in farming out of a desire to be a solution to food security which remains a thorn in the flesh for all the farmers in Nandihills and Africa as a whole. From farming, she has been able to earn a decent income and she attributes all this success to hard work and determination. Although she makes profits, she has always wanted to increase her farming and start a cereal-selling business. The main challenge she faces is lack of funds. She is seeking a loan to buy cereal. Demand for cereal is overwhelming in Nandihills and through this loan, she will buy different varieties of cereal.  This will help her satisfy the demand in her village and local market.

Damaris' upbringing was very challenging, and because of this, she promised herself that she would work hard to get out of poverty. That is why she started farming six years ago. Through farming, she has been able to earn a decent income. Damaris is the breadwinner of her family, and this really pushes her to work hard so that her children will have a bright future and her parents will have a comfortable life. \r\n\r\nDamaris is seeking a loan to buy seeds and start horticultural farming so that she can use the excess space on her land. She dreams of buying more land and increasing her horticultural farming. Accessing funds is very difficult for a woman in Africa, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva, Damaris is optimistic that her dream will be realized and her life will completely change. Through the income from horticultural farming, Damaris will assure her children a bright future and will be able to pay tuition fees for her siblings who depend on her.

This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1994353,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy seeds and grow her horticulture business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-10-17T21:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-16T21:40:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magdaline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2016-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2016-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.31},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.14},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.86},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-10T14:18:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":963335,"name":"Maria Gloria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Generally Filipinos are capable of handling life\u2019s many adversities well.

For the past 10 years Geoffrey has been involved in mixed farming. He has identified free space on his farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good-quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and milk prices have been going up in the recent past, so Geoffrey, being a visionary and entrepreneurial farmer, wants to take full advantage of this. <br \/><br \/>He has chosen the breed of cow that he will keep, and he knows that he will get not only milk from the cow but also manure, and this will boost the fertility of his farm.

Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs and some varieties of crops she plants. She also engages in some personal business to make ends meet. <br \/><br \/>Stella passionately loves farming and she says that she got interested in farming out of a desire to be a solution to food security that remains a thorn in the flesh for all the farmers in Nandihills and Africa as a whole. From farming, she has been able to earn a decent income and she attributes all this success to hardwork and determination. Although she makes profits, she has always wanted to increase her farming and start a cereal-selling business. The main challenge she has been facing is lack of funds. <br \/><br \/>She is seeking a loan to buy cereals. Demand for cereals is overwhelming in Nandihills and through your loan, she intends to buy different varieties of cereals and be able to satisfy the demand in her village and local markets. <br \/><br \/>With your loan, Stella will improve her living conditions through increased profits from selling cereals. Stella has been practicing agriculture with a difference, employing youthful energy, enthusiasm and knowledge attained through training from Juhudi Kilimo.

Meet Joan, a hardworking, dedicated and honest 38-year-old dairy farmer. As the key breadwinner of her family, with a husband and six children, she farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Siongiroi, in the Rift valley region of Kenya. For the past 10 years she has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary source of income has been milk, eggs and selling crops. She also engages in a small business to supplement the meager income she earns through farming. <br \/><br \/>Joan passionately loves dairy farming but the biggest challenge she faces is feeding her cows and satisfying the largely unsatisfied milk market. She is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit. The dairy unit will assist Joan in managing her cows well and also protecting them from the harsh weather conditions.<br \/><br \/>Before Joan joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance that supports smallholder farmers with technical and financial solutions, she considered dairy farming to be a mediocre fallback occupation that did not have a future promise for income generation. After training, Joan now believes that dairy farming is the business to go into if you want a less rough way into the \u201cmillionaires club.\" With the loan, Joan will increase her income from milk selling and her cows will have more food to eat and never reject food. The key to high yield in milk production is proper feeding of the cows and through this loan, Joan will achieve this. Through the modern dairy unit, Joan will have a comfortable time milking her cow. Also, her cow will never be affected with diseases that are associated with being exposed to harsh weather conditions.<br \/><br \/>An increase in income will allow Joan to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children. Her dream is to continue improving her dairy breeds and increase milk productivity to achieve better living standards. Joan fears that her dreams might not be realized if Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders cease to provide their reliable market channel, credit facility and services that she requires to grow her dairy enterprise.<br \/><br \/>You can help Joan to be closer to her goals, and a loan will do that."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":44.84,"image":{"id":1983014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

two children are some of the reasons that made Elizabeth start practicing mixed farming. Elizabeth is a very hardworking, energetic, young farmer. Although she has only farmed for the past 10 years, she is working hard and learning good farming practices. Through the profits she makes, she has been able to take care of her family and provide basic needs for her parents. She is based in Simat, a remote village in the Eldoret area of Kenya, an area with fertile soil famous for dairy and crop farming. The region's staple food is mursik, a mouthwatering delicacy prepared from milk. <br \/><br \/>Elizabeth is seeking a loan to buy seeds and expand her horticulture farm. She is very hardworking and determined to increase her farm's output. Loans for smallholder farmers with little irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. Few organizations such as Juhudi Kilimo support farmers like Elizabeth. Through a group of 15 members called Kipkenyo self-help group, Elizabeth has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi, which use the group-based savings as collateral. <br \/><br \/>According to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled. Because of the favorable weather and road conditions, she will have an easy time transporting her horticulture products to the market. <br \/><br \/>In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household. Juhudi Kilimo facilitates loans that empower smallholder farmers like Elizabeth because the institution believes that women too are actively involved in various segments of the horticultural industry.

She started pursuing her passion in the year 2010. She is a hardworking and honest farmer who is based in Mitine, a remote village in the Nkubu area of Kenya. She is a proud mother of two lovely children. For the past five years she has been making a small living through practicing mixed farming. Her primary source of income has been selling bananas, milk and eggs to the nearby market. She also engages in a personal business or \u201cside hustle\u201d as she likes to call it, to earn additional income. Hellen passionately loves banana farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is accessing funds to increase her business. Through Juhudi Kilimo, an organization that supports enterprising farmers, she acquired her first loan which she paid back fully. She also benefited from training. The impact of the first loan cannot be underestimated. <br \/><br \/>Hellen is seeking another loan from Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva lenders, to buy more banana seeds so that she can plant more banana trees. The banana seeds she plans to buy are not just ordinary banana seeds; they are quality seeds. Bananas cost more money.

Through these years, she has gathered a lot of experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops, and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Charity is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plough. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by buying seeds so that she can plant them, and then once the crops are ready for harvest she can sell them. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy seeds for planting. <br \/><br \/>Kenya's Nkubu area, one of the county's populated regions, has a high demand for crop produce. This means that Charity could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there.

Charity believes that this loan will be a lot of help and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for crops.

At age 42, she spends every day of the week, Monday through Sunday, in her mixed farm, tirelessly working. Purity is one of the most hardworking and dedicated women on planet earth. She is based in Karumathi, a remote village in the Nkubu area of Kenya. She is happily married to Nicholas, who adds additional income to support their family. They are blessed with three lovely children. For the past five years she has been engaged in mixed farming, and through selling milk, eggs and a variety of food crops she has earned a decent income. Like many farmers in her village, she also plants trees on her farm to complement the region's natural forests. <br \/><br \/>Although Purity makes profits selling her farm produce at the market, the biggest challenge she faces is lack of water to irrigate her farm and water for home consumption. Purity comes from an area where there is no water connection and she is always forced to walk for a long distance for this precious commodity. Purity faces challenges carrying water on her back because of her failing health. Purity is seeking a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes. Most of the farmers in Kenya depend on rain-fed agriculture but Purity wants to change that notion and start irrigation farming. Through the loan she intends to harvest rain water (which always goes to waste) and store it in the tank. She intends to buy pipes that will be used to pump water from the river directly to her farm. With your loan, Purity will be saved the trouble of walking a long distance in search of water, and she will have enough water for home consumption.

Juhudi Kilimo was established with a mission to uplift, empower, and validate women across Kenya. Gladys is a very hardworking, energetic young farmer. Although she has only farmed for the past 10 years, she is working hard and learning good farming practices. Through the profits she makes, she has been able to take care of her family and provide the basic needs for her parents. Gladys lives near Kiabiraa in the Nyamira area of Kenya, an area with good weather patterns and favorable weather conditions that support farming. <br \/><br \/>Maize is a very common crop in Kenya and is a staple food for many who regularly eat ugali (hard porridge cooked from maize). One can usually buy sifted maize flour in the market, but its cost is higher because of the processing. Flour can be less expensive, however, if it is milled directly using a posho mill. The Kiabiraa area has only one diesel posho mill that serves a great number of people. The main problem here is that the posho mill keeps breaking down so farmers cannot grind their maize. Gladys intends to change this by buying another electric posho mill to serve the area. She will buy an electric, rather than diesel, posho mill, as they are more reliable. Hopefully breakdowns will be few and far between. <br \/><br \/>To accomplish this, Gladys is applying for a 100,000 KES loan through Juhudi Kilimo to buy a mill. Profits derived from the mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan. In the next two years, Gladys sees herself established and running more than one posho mill. Gladys has many dreams, but like the mother she is, she wants the best for her three children. Therefore, she wants to pay for a good education for them. You can help this responsible woman to accomplish her dreams with a loan.

Meet Emmy, a very hardworking, energetic young farmer. Although she has only farmed for the past ten years, she is working hard and learning good farming practices. Through the profits she makes, she has been able to take care of her family and provide the basic needs for her parents. Emmy lives near Chebilbai in the Kapsowar area of Kenya, an area with good weather patterns and favorable weather conditions that support farming. <br \/><br \/>Maize is a very common crop in Kenya and is a staple food for many who regularly eat \u201cugali,\u201c or hard porridge cooked from maize. One can usually buy sifted maize flour in the market, but its cost is higher because of the processing. Flour can be less expensive, however, if it is milled directly using a posho mill. The Chebilbai area has only one diesel posho mill that serves a great number of people. The main problem here is that the posho mill keeps breaking down so farmers cannot grind their maize. Emmy intends to change this by buying another posho mill to serve the area. She will buy an electric, rather than diesel, posho mill, as they are more reliable. Hopefully breakdowns will be few and far between. To accomplish this, Emmy is applying for a 65,000 KES loan through Juhudi Kilimo to buy a mill. Profits derived from the mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan. In the next two years, Emmy sees herself established and running more than one posho mill. <br \/><br \/>Emmy is a hardworking mum who never stops dreaming. Right now she wants to improve the conditions of her house so that her family can have a better quality of life. You can help Emmy with her dreams with just a loan.<br \/><br \/>She patiently waits for your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1984212,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy an electric posho (cornmeal) mill","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-10-17T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-16T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emmy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4600.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4734.68},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":4873.05},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5015.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5162.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5312.9},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5468.17},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5627.98},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5792.46},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":5961.75},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6135.97},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6315.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.23},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.53},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.86},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.23},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.63},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.09},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.58},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.11},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.7},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.32},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-18T13:17:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara L","image":null}},{"id":951508,"name":"Beatrice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrice lives in Lelaitich village, situated in the Siongiroi area of Kenya.

Beatrice passionately loves poultry farming but the biggest challenge she is facing is lack of capital to buy quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs. <br \/><br \/>Beatrice is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders via Juhudi Kilimo to purchase additional poultry. She believes the excess maize she has will be used for feeding the poultry, her surplus sorghum will be used to give the poultry energy and the green grams for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs of good quality, which will translate to more income. Apart from an increase in egg output, Beatrice will get increased output from poultry meat, and this will increase her income and profit margins. Through increased profits, she is going to turn around her living conditions and live a better life. Beatrice will also benefit from the resulting chicken manure which contains the highest amount of nitrogen of any livestock manure and is very valuable as fertilizer. She will save more money that would have been spent in buying fertilizer.

Faith, 22 years of age, is a hardworking, honest, and dedicated farmer. She is based in Litein, a remote town with harsh living conditions because of the bad terrain in the region. Faith is happily married and she and her husband have four lovely children. Faith's primary sources of income are milk and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. Faith is a woman with tough skin and she has managed to take care of her family with her income from milk sales. <br \/><br \/>The Litein area has conditions that favor dairy farming and Faith has always wanted to take care of another dairy cow but lack of capital has prevented her. She is seeking a loan to buy an additional dairy cow. She intends to buy not just an ordinary cow, but a breed that produces between 10-20 liters of milk a day, which will translate to more income. Demand for milk in the Litein area is high but the supply is low. So, through this loan, Faith is going to have more milk and comfortably meet the demand. Her increased income will allow Faith to provide a secure future for her school-going children by paying their tuition fees. She believes that education is the gateway to success.

She is elegant and admirable in spirit and effort. She is a role model, a mentor and an inspiration to many young farmers in her village because of her resilience despite personal challenges and her passion to support her children as a primary caregiver. The living conditions in the Nyamira area are very tough and you need to have tough skin in order to survive. Beatrice has always shown the resilience to beat all odds. <br \/><br \/>Because of the hardcore poverty in her village, Beatrice started practicing mixed farming ten years ago. Her sources of income are vegetables, milk, and egg sales. However, these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market. The Nyamira area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market, which is the reason Beatrice is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. The motorbike will enable her to deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. <br \/><br \/>Beatrice is very determined to succeed. Because she is much disciplined with finances, she plans to be able to provide a secure future for herself and for her children through accumulated profits. Beatrice's dream is to provide a secure future for her children by paying their tuition fees.

Ruth is a youthful, 40-year-old farmer from Kabati, a remote village in the Thika area of Kenya where people live in shanties made from whatever materials they can find, usually sheets of corrugated tin. According to residents, the people of Kabati are forgotten or ignored by the county government of Thika. But within the remote village of Kabati, Ruth is working hard to pull herself out of the dismal conditions. Most small-holder farmers view Ruth as a role model and a mentor because of the resilience that she has despite personal challenges, and her passion to support her four children as a primary caregiver. Ruth started farming in 2007 after the country suffered post-election violence. With the unstinting support of her husband, who dedicated his half an acre, she has grown the business dramatically. She has acquired numerous income-generating assets, including farm machines. She keeps dairy cattle and grows subsistence and commercial crops, such as maize and beans. She takes pride in being independent and being involved in a sector that feeds the population. Ruth is seeking a loan to purchase more land. Her operations are growing consistently, eating up the available space. With your funding, Ruth will have more space to expand her business output. The money from the investment will be ploughed back into the business to finance even more growth.

She is happily married and, together with her husband, has a lovely family. <br \/><br \/>Rosaline\u2019s primary sources of income are milk and some personal business (motorbike business) she engages in to make ends meet. Rosaline has managed to take care of her family with her income from milk selling. The Siongiroi area has conditions that favor dairy farming. <br \/><br \/>Rosaline has always wanted to take care of another dairy cow but the lack of capital has prevented her. She is seeking a loan to buy an additional dairy cow. The dairy cow she intends to buy is not just an ordinary cow - it\u2019s a breed that produces between 10-15 liters of milk a day. With this cow, she will produce more milk which will translate to more income. Demand for milk in the Siongiroi area is high but the supply is low.

She is very hardworking and determined to increase her farm's output. Loans for smallholder farmers with little, irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. Few organizations such as Juhudi Kilimo support farmers like Catherine. Through a group of 15 members called Njoe, Catherine has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi, which use the group-based savings as collateral. <br \/><br \/>According to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled. In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household. Juhudi Kilimo facilitates loans that empower smallholder farmers like Catherine because the institution believes that women too are actively involved in various segments of the horticultural industry."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1986182,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to expand her horticulture farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-10-18T01:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-17T01:20:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2016-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.23},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.85},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-25T11:07:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":960848,"name":"Viviana Patricia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Viviana es una mujer de 32 a\u00f1os de edad, la cual inici\u00f3 un negocio como independiente en el a\u00f1o 2014 de venta de mercanc\u00eda por cat\u00e1logo, la cual funciona de la siguiente manera; ella muestra las revistas, los clientes realizan el pedido, ella compra y da un tiempo de 1 mes para que le paguen los pedidos.\nEst\u00e1 actividad la inicio por necesidad econ\u00f3mica ya que su esposo se ve\u00eda ajustado para cubrir los gastos de su hogar el cual es formado por ellos dos y sus 3 hijas de 9, 3 y 2 a\u00f1os de edad.\nPensando en generar ingresos para mejorar la calidad de vida, asegurar la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos, Viviana quiere solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar mercanc\u00eda con la que cubrir\u00e1 unos pedidos que tiene pendientes, el apoyo monetario servir\u00e1 para mejorar sus ventas, aumentar su inventario y su cupo con las revistas y consolidarse en el sector.\n","en":"Viviana is 32 years old.

He hails from the Nkubu area of Kenya. He never got the opportunity to advance his education and get a white collar job but this did not kill his dream of wanting to succeed in life. <br \/><br \/>Joseph started farming and has been doing farming for the past ten years. Through those years, he has gathered so much experience that all the farming techniques are at his fingertips. Joseph practices mixed farming on his farm and, through the profits, he has managed to take care of his family's needs and also give his children a good education because he believes that education is the key to success. <br \/><br \/>Joseph is a farmer who is very enterprising and he is seeking a loan of KES 100,000 to buy seeds and start horticulture farming on his farm. Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in his village, good soil, and a ready market for horticulture products, Joseph wants to take advantage of those and reap more profits. <br \/><br \/>Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring men like Joseph to make their farming dreams come to reality through training and loan financing. Joseph hopes that, through the loan, he will improve his living conditions. Joseph\u2019s dreams and projections are that, by the end of the first year, he will not only be selling in the local market but will also be selling in international markets through exporting fruits and vegetables. <br \/><br \/>Through this he will be able to assure his children a secure future and uninterrupted learning because he will be able to pay tuition fees on time. Joseph is not a selfish man and will also want to impact positively on society. That is why he will employ people to work for him on his horticulture farm, hence having an impact on society.<br \/><br \/>Help this smallholder farmer with dreams and goals to realize!

Meet Esther (pictured above) from the Nkubu area of Kenya, an area that is very fertile. Esther is 55 years old and a proud mother of angel-looking children whom she really adores and cherishes. Other than doing some small business, Esther is a very hardworking farmer who has been farming for the past five years. She has gained so much experience through those years of farming. <br \/><br \/>Esther practices mixed farming. That is, she grows maize and keeps dairy cows, and through these activities she has been able to earn a decent and honest income. Because of the passion she has for farming, she has even nicknamed one of her cows. She really enjoys taking care of her cows. <br \/><br \/>Although Esther has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious mum. Her farm has not been producing as much of a harvest because of the lack of fertilizer and good seeds and the presence of pests and diseases. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy farm inputs. Through the loan, Esther will be assured of a bumper harvest, and this will translate into more profits and cash. Through the use of good seeds and fertilizer, she will increase her profit margins. <br \/><br \/>Through this loan, Esther will be able to expand her farming business. She sees a lot of room for improvement and growth. What is lacking is the capital to drive the positive change. With your loan, Esther will make enough income to take care of her family and other farming expenses. She wakes up early and goes to sleep very late every day to give her family a decent living and afford her children proper education. <br \/><br \/>Esther has many dreams. The main one is to make her farming business successful so that one day her children can inherit it and keep it so they have something to provide for themselves.

Eustace resides in the Nkubu area of Kenya, an area with good weather patterns and favorable weather conditions that support farming activities. <br \/><br \/>He has been doing mixed farming for the past five years and through those years he has gathered so much experience with the techniques of farming. Through the income from farming, he has been able to take care of his family and also provide the basic needs for his children. <br \/><br \/>Eustace is a very enterprising man, and although he never got formal education, he has always worked hard on his farm and he has always assured his family of a decent meal. The Nkubu area has favorable conditions for horticulture farming, and that is why he is seeking a loan to buy seeds and start horticulture farming. <br \/><br \/>Because of good roads, a good climate, and a good transportation network, he is sure that he will reap maximum profits and be able to increase his business.

He is arguably the most successful client of Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that deals only with smallholder farmers in rural parts of Kenya. Maize is Samwel\u2019s flagship produce. He sells more than 100 bags of maize.<br \/><br \/>Back in the late 1990\u2019s, Samwel practiced traditional farming with little knowledge and no financing at all. He was doing only half an acre of maize crop per season. The returns were so meager that he could barely fend for survival.<br \/><br \/>Today, Samwel is a fully-fledged entrepreneur. He has been provided with technical guidance, training programs and exposure visits. He has already serviced other asset-based loans fully from Juhudi Kilimo! Through the loans, he has acquired high quality poultry birds, a dairy unit and horticultural input. He has employed people to help run his agribusiness. <br \/><br \/>To capitalize more on returns from the booming horticulture farming, Samwel is seeking a loan of KES 100,000 to build a greenhouse. Unlike his competition, Samwel conducts proper soil preparation and uses modern farming techniques to ensure high quality produce. By doing this, he has created a name for himself and a demand for his produce. <br \/><br \/>Your lending will contribute greatly to the actualization of Samwel\u2019s goal, which is to expand the greenhouse. In the future, he is also planning to introduce zero grazing method, intensify his maize farming, and start value addition.<br \/>Samwel shows everybody that it is never too late to fulfill dreams, and he wants to accomplish a lot more, like improving the condition of his house.

According to residents, the people of Nandihills are forgotten or ignored by the county government. But within the remote village in Nandihills Faith is working hard to pull herself out of the dismal conditions. Most small-holder farmers view Faith as a role model and a mentor because of the resilience that she has despite personal challenges, and her passion to support her two children as a primary caregiver. With the unstinting support of her husband, who dedicated his 5 acres, she has grown the business dramatically.  She keeps dairy cattle and grows subsistence and commercial crops, such as maize and tea. She takes pride in being independent and being involved in a sector that feeds the population.<br \/><br \/> Faith is seeking a loan to purchase more land. Her operations are growing consistently, eating up the available space. With your funding, Faith will have more space to expand her business output.

Flour can be less expensive, however, if it is milled directly using a posho mill. The Kapcherop area has only one diesel posho mill that serves a great number of people. The main problem here is that the posho mill keeps breaking down so farmers cannot grind their maize. Mary intends to change this by buying another posho mill to serve the area. <br \/><br \/>She will buy an electric, rather than diesel, posho mill, as they are more reliable. To accomplish this, Anna is applying for a 75,000 KES loan through Juhudi Kilimo to buy a mill. Profits derived from the mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan.

Since the year 2000, Ainura's work in animal husbandry and agriculture has served as an additional source of income for her family.  Thanks to Ainura's hard work, she now has 4 cows, 15 sheep, and a horse, and a 0.33 hectare plot of land on which she raises alfalfa.  Ainura's business provides her approximately 9,000 KGS per month, which helps her pay for food and for her family's needs.  With the goal of further expanding her business, Ainura turned to the bank \"Bai-Tushum\" for a loan of 20,000 KGS to purchase sheep to fatten and sell.  With the income from the loan Ainura plans to invest in the further expansion of her business, and also in the future plans to save toward purchasing a car."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":43.1,"image":{"id":1974623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase sheep to fatten and resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Naryn district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-10-18T02:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-17T02:40:04Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ainura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1416},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1457},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1499},{"due_date":"2015-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1543},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1588},{"due_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1635},{"due_date":"2016-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1682},{"due_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1731},{"due_date":"2016-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1782},{"due_date":"2016-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1834},{"due_date":"2016-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1887},{"due_date":"2016-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1946}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.24},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.86},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.23},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.96},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.51},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.3},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":43.1,"local_amount":2873,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-19T13:12:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2961.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752026607}],"funded_date":"2015-10-21T16:00:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Whitney Muhlestein","image":null}},{"id":960723,"name":"Hellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hellen is 44 years old and a proud mother of 2 children.

","en":"Elmurod is a responsible and active handyman.  He is 30 years old, married, and has children.  Elmurod lives together with his father, mother, younger sister, wife, and children.  Elmurod's wife works in retail at a store.  Elmurod himself has mastered his father's business, and is following in his footsteps.  He works repairing cars, and does welding, applies putty, and primes and paints.  He does everything himself, though his father occasionally helps him.  Elmurod has only one sister.  Right now she is very sick, and needs medicine and an operation.  The family doesn't have enough money to pay for the operation, and so Elmurod decided to ask for a loan for the operation and to buy medicine."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":109.91,"image":{"id":1999665,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Medical Expenses","sector":"Health","themes":["Health"],"use":"to pay for his younger sister's operation and to purchase medicine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Istaravshan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.910833 69.006389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-10-18T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-17T03:00:02Z","loan_amount":1550,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elmurod","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":709.11},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":711.76},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":759.62},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":766.21},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":789.93},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":826.34},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":839.22},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":864.8},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":894.85},{"due_date":"2016-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":921.25},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":946.55},{"due_date":"2016-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":970.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.91},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.32},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.74},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.76},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.44},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.08},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.08},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.05},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":138.7},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.79},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.72},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":109.91,"local_amount":709.11,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T17:10:12Z","rounded_local_amount":717.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752131466}],"funded_date":"2015-10-18T20:50:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Whitney Muhlestein","image":null}}]}
