Meet Esther, who is a tenacious, determined, and very resourceful woman who hails from the Nandi Hills area of Kenya. She is a proud mother and has been doing mixed farming for the past four years.

She really takes good care of her dairy cows. She wakes up every morning to milk her cows, and she has even nicknamed them. While this humble mom has been making a profit by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand for her products. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. <br \/><br \/>Esther is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce 10 to 20 liters of nutritious milk each day and will be able to satisfy the demand.

She will use her excess maize to feed the poultry and will provide sorghum to give the poultry energy and green grams (beans) for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs that are of good quality, which will translate to more income.

Rose has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and the price of milk has been going up recently, so Rose, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she learned that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure to boost the fertility of her farm. Selling the milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also sell to big dairy processing firms. <br \/><br \/>Rose said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agriculture-based loans and their interest rate is low and offered on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo and, from the training, she learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro-finance institutions. Rose hopes that through the accumulated profit she will be able to add value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products.

Income from milk, eggs, and crop selling has allowed her to earn a decent income. To make extra coin, Georgina engages in small personal business. <br \/><br \/>Georgina passionately loves dairy farming and the animals on her farm have been given names. Through milk selling, she has had quite good returns and the demand for milk has been expanding. Demand has been overwhelming, so she is requesting a loan to buy a quality dairy cow.

Meet Karimi, a hardworking, dedicated and honest 44-year-old dairy farmer. As the key breadwinner of her family- which includes her husband and three children- she farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Nkubu in the central region of Kenya. For the past five years, she has been practicing mixed farming and her primary source of income has been from selling milk, eggs and crops. She also engages in a small business to supplement the meager income she earns through farming. <br \/><br \/>Karimi passionately loves dairy farming but the biggest challenge she faces is feeding her cows and satisfying the largely unsatisfied milk market. She is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit and expand her farming. The dairy unit will assist Karimi in managing her cows well and will also protect them from the harsh weather conditions.<br \/><br \/>Before Karimi joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports smallholder farmers with technical and financial solutions, she considered dairy farming to be a mediocre fallback occupation that did not have a future promise for income generation. After training, Karimi now believes that dairy farming is the business to go into if you want a rather less rough way into the \u201cmillionaires club\u201d. With the loan, Karimi will increase her income from milk selling and her cows will have more food to eat. The key to high yield in milk production is proper feeding of the cows and through this loan, Karimi will achieve this. Through this loan she will also expand her farming and produce more.<br \/><br \/>An increase in income will allow Karimi to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children. Her dream is to continue improving her dairy breeds and increase milk productivity to achieve better living standards. Karimi fears that her dreams might not be realized if Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva lenders cease to provide the reliable market channel, credit facility and services that she requires to grow her dairy enterprise.<br \/><br \/>You can help Karimi to be closer to her goals, and a loan will do that.

Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, crops and some small business ventures that help her make ends meet. Caroline is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why she wakes up very early every day to go to her farm to plow. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals.

She is based in Kerugoya. It is a remote town with harsh living conditions because of the bad terrain in the region. She is happily married and, together with her husband, has four lovely children. Her primary sources of income are cow and goat milk and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. Mary is a tough woman with tough skin and she has managed to take care of her family with her income from goat milk selling. The Kerugoya area has conditions that favor dairy goat farming and Mary has always wanted to take care of another dairy goat but the lack of capital has prevented her. She is seeking a loan to buy an additional dairy goat. The dairy goat she intends to buy is not just an ordinary goat. It\u2019s a breed that produces between 1-3 liters of milk a day. With this goat, she will produce more milk which will translate to more income. Demand for milk in the Kerugoya area is high but the supply is low. So, through this loan, Mary is going to reap more and comfortably meet the demand.

Alice is well disciplined with finances and she plans that through the accumulated profits, she will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children who are in college and primary school.

Their main income sources are milk and crops. She recently ventured into a \u201cside hustle\u201d business. <br \/><br \/>From Kiva lenders, Agnes is seeking a loan worth 20,000 KES to grow her horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, made evident by the steadily rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. It is against this backdrop that Juhudi Kilimo has teamed up with Kiva to provide Agnes with access to a loan that will help her to grow her horticulture farm into a highly profitable business and that will also increase employment opportunities and bring about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. With your loan, Agnes' family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income but it will also reduce their income vulnerability.<br \/>Be inspired and make a loan!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1994324,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to grow her horticulture business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-10-18T13:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-17T13:30:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2016-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.16},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.43},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.88},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.35},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.83},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.82},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.88},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-18T23:20:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Bethany Katerberg","image":604977}},{"id":959380,"name":"L\u2019Union A Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Chibichabene est commer\u00e7ante, membre du groupe solidaire \u00abL\u2019union A\u00bb, cliente de l\u2019IMF Hekima, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 29 ans, mari\u00e9e, m\u00e8re de cinq enfants dont quatre scolaris\u00e9s et 1 est gosse.

Meet Petroline, a young farmer from the Nandihills County in Kenya who has defied the common thinking that most Kenyans hold about agriculture. Petroline is a proud owner of a small parcel of land on which she has been practicing mixed farming for the past 5 years. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs and the variety of crops she plants. She also engages in some personal business to make ends meet. Petroline passionately loves farming and she says that she got interested in farming out of a desire to find a solution for food security that remains a thorn in the flesh for all the farmers in Nandihills and Africa as a whole. From farming, she has been able to earn a decent income and she attributes all of this success to hard work and determination. <br \/><br \/>Although she makes profits, she has always wanted to add to her farming so she started a cereal-selling business. The main challenge she has been facing is a lack of funds. She is seeking a loan to buy cereals. Demand for cereals is overwhelming in Nandihills and through your loan, she intends to buy different varieties of cereals to be able to satisfy the demand in her village and local market. With your loan, Petroline will improve her living conditions through increased profits from selling cereals. Petroline has been practicing agriculture by employing youthful energy, enthusiasm and knowledge attained through training from Juhudi Kilimo. She believes that her cereal-selling business will increase in leaps and bounds. <br \/>There is no doubt that through your loan, Petroline's life is permanently going to change and she will assure that her school-going children have a secure future.

For the last ten years, Virginia has been engaged in mixed farming and has never looked back; she really likes what she does. Her primary sources of income have been sales of milk, eggs and crops as well as some personal business in which she engages to make ends meet. <br \/><br \/>Virginia finds farming very fulfilling and agrees with the notion that farming is a very profitable business venture. However, she constantly faces the challenge of poor productivity on her farm owing to a lack of farm inputs. She is seeking a loan to buy farm inputs such as quality seeds and fertilizer that will increase her production levels, which will immediately translate into increased income levels. <br \/><br \/>Virginia is a very hard-working woman who believes that, through hard work and honest sweat, her living conditions will permanently change. She will use the extra income she will receive to repay the loan and expand her farming business.<br \/><br \/>Be inspired and support a Kenyan woman!"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1994612,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase farm inputs such as quality seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-10-18T14:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-17T14:40:05Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1466.53},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1509.39},{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1553.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1598.9},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1645.63},{"due_date":"2016-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1693.72},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1743.22},{"due_date":"2016-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1794.17},{"due_date":"2016-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1846.6},{"due_date":"2016-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1900.57},{"due_date":"2016-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1956.11},{"due_date":"2016-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2013.28},{"due_date":"2016-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2072.12},{"due_date":"2016-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2132.68},{"due_date":"2017-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2195},{"due_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2259.15},{"due_date":"2017-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2325.18},{"due_date":"2017-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2393.13},{"due_date":"2017-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2463.07},{"due_date":"2017-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2535.05},{"due_date":"2017-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2609.14},{"due_date":"2017-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2685.39},{"due_date":"2017-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2763.87},{"due_date":"2017-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2844.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.09},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.53},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.46},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.94},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.43},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.94},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.47},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.01},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.56},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.13},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.72},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.33},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.95},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.59},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.25},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.93},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.63},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.35},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.09},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.85},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.64},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":963432,"name":"Elianora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elianora is 53 years old married woman.

However, for Rebecca, life begins at 40. <br \/><br \/>This mother of six has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years on her small parcel of land in the Nyamira area of Kenya and has been earning a decent income. She also does some personal business to supplement her income. <br \/><br \/>Of all the activities she is involved in, Rebecca enjoys poultry keeping the most. To her, poultry keeping went from being a way of life on an African homestead to being a hobby, to being a business. <br \/><br \/>Rebecca is requesting a loan to buy additional poultry. With this loan, she seeks to grow her business. However, it has been a rough ride for her to find a financier who would front money to a mere smallholder farmer without substantial security or a bank statement showing a regular source of income. <br \/><br \/>Today, Rebecca is a member of Bigogo Self-Help Group.

The Nyamira area has favorable conditions for horticulture farming, and that is why she is seeking a loan to start horticulture farming. Because of good roads, a good climate, and a good transportation network, she is sure that she will reap maximum profits and be able to increase her business. <br \/><br \/>Being an elderly woman and accessing funds in Africa is very challenging, but Jerusha feels relieved knowing there are institutions such as Kiva that help enterprising women like her. Jerusha is well disciplined with finances and she plans that through the accumulated profits, she will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her children, who are in primary school and high school. Please help Jerusha so that her horticulture farming can flourish!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1996228,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to start horticulture farming and provide a better income for her three children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-10-18T15:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-17T15:00:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jerusha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.22},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1588.3},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.16},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.43},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.88},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.35},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.83},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.82},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.88},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-20T15:24:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":960895,"name":"Wadid Manuel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Wadid es un hombre humilde, sencillo y enfocado en su meta de mejorar las condiciones de vida de su vivienda, vive en una zona de postconflicto, las oportunidades de empleo son bajas, por ello decidi\u00f3 iniciar un negocio de tienda de productos de la canasta familiar en el a\u00f1o 2010 y desde entonces ha podido mantenerse en el tiempo y pagar sus cuentas b\u00e1sicas.\nWadid siempre ha querido crecer, aumentar su mercanc\u00eda, peor la falta de capital ha sido su principal impedimento, pero todo esto cambiara, tiene la esperanza de obtener un apoyo monetario que usara para aumentar su cantidad de inventario, invertir en estanter\u00edas, busca atraer un mayor n\u00famero de clientes y tener disponibilidad y variedad de surtido.\n","en":"Wadid is a man who is humble, modest, and focused on his goal of improving the living conditions of his home.

Meet Judith. She lives in the Chuka area of Kenya, renowned for its rolling hills carpeted in tea plantations. <br \/><br \/>Judith is a mother of three and she has been in the agriculture business for 10 years. Her primary income sources are milk, eggs and tea. Judith has been relying on agriculture to make all her income. However, rising costs of farming inputs, such as for fertilizers, and fluctuations in market prices, are some of the serious challenges that are cutting farmers' profits significantly. Despite these tough conditions, Judith remains positive and passionate about her economic activity. <br \/><br \/>Judith is seeking a loan to purchase poultry. This will enable her to expand the section of her business least affected by harsh external conditions. Poultry farming is cheaper to run and the demand for chicken products is always high. <br \/><br \/>With this loan, Judith will be able to increase the sales from her poultry business and make more profits. An increase in income is timely since it will enable her to tackle high farm-related costs next season. This will greatly improve the quality of work since the cost of every input will be adequately met.

Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in the Nyamira area. Grace has good knowledge of the market and has been taking advantage of the ready market - the demand is very high.<br \/><br \/>She is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. Accessing financial services for women is very difficult, but through institutions such as Kiva, enterprising women like Grace can achieve their dreams and goals. Grace believes that the key to increased egg production is proper feeding and good care.  In addition to selling eggs and poultry meat, she will also sell poultry feathers that are commonly used to make earrings. The increased income will be used to improve her living conditions and to repay the loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1999630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-10-18T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-17T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.23},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.85},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-18T22:43:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":962024,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Born in 1991, Gladys has grown into a strong and independent woman.

Though her responsibilities are critical to her family\u2019s well-being, they are considered a mere duty in Kenya, a job with little appreciation. Her primary sources of income are dairy farming, eggs and some personal business that she engages in. <br \/><br \/>Emilliah is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES from Kiva lenders to buy seeds and grow her horticulture business. Horticultural produce and processed products from the developing world are becoming increasingly popular in international markets, evident by the steadily-rising exports. While experience shows that horticulture offers good opportunities for poverty reduction, because it increases employment and generates income, the government takes little care to ensure that small and poor farmers are not excluded from the opportunities in this market sector. It is against this backdrop that Juhudi has teamed up with Kiva to give Emilliah access to a loan that will aid her in growing her horticulture farm into a highly profitable business, increasing employment opportunities, and bringing about increasing commercialization of the rural sector. <br \/><br \/>With your loan, Emilliah\u2019s family will benefit from the growth and diversification of their family business. This will not only increase their income, but also reduce their income vulnerability.

For the past ten years, she has been actively involved in mixed farming. Annah says, \u201cI have always had an affinity for farming, and it runs in my blood.\u201d She likes farming so much that she has even nicknamed one of her cows. She is a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows. Through her dairy cows, she is able to get between 10-15 liters of milk a day, and this helps her support her family. <br \/><br \/>Annah also practices crop farming. She has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements. This is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. Through this loan, she will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. <br \/><br \/>Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques, and therefore using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and increased profit levels.

She also does dairy farming. With time, the fertility of her land has started to dwindle and whenever she plants maize the yields go down with each cropping season. Lydia has also been affected with weeds. At some point she could not be assured of harvesting anything at all. <br \/><br \/>Today, Lydia is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy fertilizers, pesticides and good quality seeds. Through this loan Lydia is going to increase her crop production and this will translate to an improved income level. This loan will permanently change the living standards of Lydia; there is no doubt that you can find rewarding employment in farming.<br \/><br \/>Change the life of this farmer, make a loan."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2000426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farm implements such as fertilizers, pesticides and good quality seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-10-18T16:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-17T16:40:05Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lydia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.39},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.42},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.58},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.71},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.87},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.06},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.29},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.56},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.86},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.2},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-14T21:22:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":960913,"name":"Maria Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a maria de 57 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su esposo y su hija, ella se dedica a la venta de pupusas desde hace 7 a\u00f1os, su esposo trabaja como agricola y entre los dos ha sacado adelante su hogar, hoy ella quiere comparar mas materia prima para seguir con su trabajo como: chicharr\u00f3n, quesillo, frijoles, ma\u00edz y dem\u00e1s ingredientes ya que le va bien en su negocio y asi podra tener mejores ganancias para una mejor calidad de vida junto con su familia.","en":"Maria is 57 years old and lives in a house of her own with her husband and daughter.

She believes the excess maize she has will be used in feeding the poultry; sorghum will be used in giving the poultry energy, and green grams for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs that are of good quality which will translate to more income. Apart from an increase in egg output, she will get increased output from poultry meat, and this will increase her income and profit margins. <br \/><br \/>Other than profits, she is going to benefit from chicken manure which contains the highest amount of nitrogen of any livestock manure and is very valuable as fertilizer.

She is a very determined and dedicated farmer who has been farming for five years. Throughout this time, she has never regretted going into farming.

Through these ventures, she has been able to earn a decent income.  <br \/><br \/>Although this humble mum has been making profits, not everything has been \u201ca bed of roses.\" She faces financial challenges. Because the Nkubu area has proven a ready market for cereals, she is seeking a loan to buy cereals for resale and thus improve her income. <br \/><br \/>Jackline\u2019s upbringing was challenging, and she has faced many economic problems. Still, this ever-smiling mum has been making great improvements. She is quite a visionary.

With her accumulated profits, she hopes to open a large cereal-selling shop that will boost her income and turn her life around.<br \/><br \/>Regardless of the great impact that agriculture has on the Kenyan economy, microfinance institutions view lending for agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition. Juhudi Kilimo is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders the opportunity to support Kenyan farmers.

Despite this hardship, you find Emmy a hardworking farmer. She is a loving mum and has been farming for the past 10 years. Emmy passionately loves dairy farming. This can be attested to by the fact that she knows her cows, each individually, because she works with them twice a day, 365 days a year. She has even named one of them. Because she loves the cows, she makes sure she feeds them well and breeds them well too. <br \/><br \/>Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, vegetables, and some personal business that she engages in to make ends meet. The income she makes from selling milk, eggs, and crops is insufficient to meet her family's expenses, but she has still kept hope alive that she will improve.<br \/><br \/>She is seeking a loan from Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva lenders, to buy a motorbike. Juhudi Kilimo serves poor, smallholder farmers in Kenya. This is a severely marginalized group with little access to financial services. By extending credit to the farmers, Juhudi helps them acquire assets like dairy cows, motorbikes, poultry, irrigation equipment, and greenhouses. Emmy's sources of income are vegetables, milk, and eggs; these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market. One problem that she faces is delivering to the market on time.

living and progress. Such is the case with Franklin, 39, who has gone through many adversities but has always put on a brave face. <br \/><br \/>Franklin resides in a remote village in the Chuka area of Kenya. He is elegant and admirable in spirit and effort. He is a role model, a mentor and an inspiration to many young farmers in his village. That is because of his resilience, in spite of personal challenges, and his passion to support his two children as a primary caregiver. <br \/><br \/>The living conditions in the Chuka area are very tough, and you need tough skin to survive. Franklin has always shown resilience to beat all odds. Because of the hardcore poverty in his village, Franklin started practising mixed farming 10 years ago. His sources of income are vegetables, milk and eggs. These products, however, are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market. <br \/><br \/>The Chuka area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market. This is why Franklin is seeking a loan to buy a motorbike as well as another quality dairy cow. With the motorbike, he will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will be fresh. The dairy cow will produce more milk and meet the increased demand for it.<br \/><br \/>Franklin is determined to succeed. Because he is very disciplined with finances, he plans to provide a secure future for himself and his children through his accumulated profits. His dream is to provide a secure future for his children by paying their tuition fees. You will help him realize his dream through your loan.<br \/><br \/>For Franklin, nothing is impossible. He wants to continue working to fulfill his dream of becoming the lead supplier of farm produce and milk in his village."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1999776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a motorbike for timely delivery of produce to the market as well as a quality breed of cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-10-18T17:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-17T17:20:05Z","loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Franklin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":170000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4986.19},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5131.91},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5281.89},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5436.26},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":5595.13},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5758.65},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5926.94},{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6100.16},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6278.44},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6461.92},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6650.77},{"due_date":"2016-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":6845.14},{"due_date":"2016-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":7045.19},{"due_date":"2016-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":7251.09},{"due_date":"2017-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":7463},{"due_date":"2017-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":7681.11},{"due_date":"2017-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":7905.59},{"due_date":"2017-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":8136.63},{"due_date":"2017-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":8374.45},{"due_date":"2017-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":8619.16},{"due_date":"2017-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":8871.06},{"due_date":"2017-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":9130.39},{"due_date":"2017-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":9397.15},{"due_date":"2017-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":9671.78}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.13},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.56},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.56},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.13},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.74},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.4},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.1},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.86},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.67},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.53},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.45},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.42},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.45},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.53},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.68},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.89},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.17},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.51},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.92},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.41},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.96},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.59},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judy Pike","image":2004103}},{"id":963407,"name":"Margaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret, a mother of four, lives in the remote village of Keberigo in Nyamira. This area is known to have high demand for poultry products. She practices mixed farming, keeping poultry and growing bananas, maize, and a variety of other food crops. Of all the activities in which she is involved, poultry farming is closest to her heart. Waking up every morning to collect eggs makes her very proud. Feeding her poultry is her hobby.<br \/><br \/>Margaret has always wanted to increase her poultry farming operation, because the demand is overwhelming, but the biggest challenge has been a lack of capital. Margaret has traits of a mobilizer, and she decided to mobilize other small-scale farmers who share this common problem. Together, they joined Juhudi Kilimo, a micro finance organization that uses a co-guarantee mechanism to provide agricultural loans. Margaret is seeking a loan to buy additional poultry. With the loan, she will be able to buy more poultry and satisfy the overwhelming demand. Using the loan she will significantly increase her sales, and this will translate to more profits. Demand for chicken is high in Nyamira; it is a popular meal for many people, and fast food joints are always full.<br \/><br \/>Increased profits will allow Margaret to improve her living conditions and get out of the poverty-stricken situation she is currently in. In addition to the expected profits, she will benefit from using poultry manure, which has higher nitrogen than other livestock manure, to fertilize her crop land. Through the loan, Margaret sees a brighter future. She awaits your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2001280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy additional poultry birds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nyamira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-10-18T17:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-17T17:20:05Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.16},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.43},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.88},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.35},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.83},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.82},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.88},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-23T23:51:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":963471,"name":"Helen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Helen is 43 years old, married with five children.<br \/><br \/>Helen works hard to provide for her family.

Meet Millicent, a youthful, 28-year-old mrembo (beautiful woman). She is a wise farmer, whom neighbors and fellow farmers respect as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in Kitale, in the Rift valley region of Kenya. Millicent is happily married and, together with her husband, has been blessed with three lovely children. For the past 14 years she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary sources of income have been growing maize and vegetables, and keeping dairy cows. She has been able to provide nutritious food for her family.<br \/><br \/>Although she has been making profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with a challenge -- namely, delivering produce to the market in a timely manner. This challenge has not made her give up:  \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. Millicent mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva lenders, to buy a motorbike. Millicent is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge that has caused her to suffer too many losses. Perishable products, such as milk, vegetables, and tomatoes, require timely delivery to the market if you are to fetch a high price. Through this loan, Millicent is going to achieve her dream and goal.<br \/><br \/>Accessing a financial solution is an uphill battle for women in Kenya. Millicent feels relieved now, to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo (with help from Kiva) that help out women, so that they can gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical, because she will never again suffer losses due to delay in delivery of her produce to the market. In addition, she will increase her sales volume, because she will be able to transport more goods to the market, and this will increase her income level. Millicent is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community, because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping her in farm work. With profits earned using your loan, Millicent will improve her living conditions by building a good house, and will assure her children of a secure future."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2001327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike and hire a helper to transport her produce to market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-10-18T17:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-17T17:30:04Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Millicent","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2795.53},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2877.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2961.31},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3047.86},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3136.93},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3228.61},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3322.96},{"due_date":"2016-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3420.08},{"due_date":"2016-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3520.03},{"due_date":"2016-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3622.9},{"due_date":"2016-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3728.78},{"due_date":"2016-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3837.75},{"due_date":"2016-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3949.91},{"due_date":"2016-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4065.35},{"due_date":"2017-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4184.16},{"due_date":"2017-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4306.44},{"due_date":"2017-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4432.3},{"due_date":"2017-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":4561.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.96},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.77},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.61},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.48},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.37},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.29},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.23},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.2},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.2},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.23},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.29},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.38},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.5},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.65},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.84},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.06},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.32},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":962318,"name":"Noah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Noah is a brave, hardworking, smallholder farmer who has a will of iron.

He attended school and cleared secondary, after which he got into mixed farming. That was 10 years ago. He also married a beautiful and loving wife, and they have four children. <br \/><br \/>Noah practises farming on a 20-acre farm, which is owned by the family, in the village of Kapseret. He grows vegetables, beans and maize and keeps several highly productive dairy cows for milk production. The 43-year-old farmer sells his produce in bulk to the nearby market. His key clients are his neighbours and local people. He is a member of the Kipkenyo self-help group, a group formed to help members, who are smallholder farmers, save and use their savings to access loans from financial institutions. <br \/><br \/>Noah is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to build a greenhouse. He needs greenhouse technology to continuously improve the productivity, profitability and sustainability of his major farming systems. A greenhouse will provide a favorable environment for his plants. It will protect them from adverse climatic conditions, such as wind, cold, precipitation, excessive radiation, extreme temperature, insects and disease. <br \/><br \/>With your loan, Noah will have a year-round production of crops and off-season production of vegetable and fruits. He will also save on the use of natural resources, such as water. With greenhouse technlogogy, the water requirements of crops are limited and easy to control. Through this loan, Noah will be able to sell milk to his neighbours and to the nearby market, hence making more money. <br \/><br \/>Noah has a great credit history. He took a previous loan of 68,275 Kenyan shillings and successfully serviced the loan. This will be his second loan with Juhudi Kilimo. After successfully clearing the previous loan, he believes this one will change his life. Profits from this investment will be be plowed back into the business to fuel further growth.

She is a smallholder farmer based in Kitale, which is a small rural town in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. The adversity that has followed her has not been an obstacle for this woman who has not left her dreams behind and wants to succeed. For four years, Tabitha has been a mixed farmer. She keeps dairy cattle and poultry on her farm. She also grows vegetables, among other crops. Despite prevailing animal diseases, Tabitha finds dairy farming to be the most enjoyable commercial farming activity. Besides dairy farming, she has a deep connection with gardening. <br \/><br \/>In African communities, gardening is the most popular, yet the least exclusive hobby for women. You don't have to be born with a green thumb to give life to a glorious garden; any woman with a homestead and a few square feet of earth is doing her best to make her little corner of the world more gracious and beautiful. <br \/><br \/>Tabitha is requesting a loan, which she will use to buy seeds to start horticultural farming.

village in Nyamira. She is happily married and blessed with two children. She has been practising mixed farming for the last five years and has gained much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. <br \/><br \/>The Nyamira area is very populated, and demand for poultry products is high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable. She has stated that the most enjoyable part of poultry farming is the \"increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand, which is really high. She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming and is seeking a loan of 20,000 Kenyan shillings to buy poultry. <br \/><br \/>For a woman, accessing funds is very challenging. But, through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved to know that her dream will be achieved and that she will be able to buy more poultry. Through this loan, she will sell eggs and other poultry products to her neighbors and the local market. The sales will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income.

Dorcas, 32, a youthful mother and wise farmer, is respected by her neighbours and fellow farmers as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kapsowar, which is in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. <br \/><br \/>Dorcas is happily married and blessed with a lovely family. She grows maize and vegetables and also has dairy cows. She has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. <br \/><br \/>She also earns profits selling a variety of food crops but is faced with the challenge of delivering the produce to the market in a timely manner. Her remote village has poor roads. Transporting her produce has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables, and tomatoes), which require timely delivery to the market. This challenge, however, has not made her give up. She says, \u201cI have to do something for my family.\u201c <br \/><br \/>Dorcas has joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like herself. She is requesting a loan via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. This loan will help her achieve her dream and reach her goals. <br \/><br \/>Accessing financial solutions for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Dorcas feels relieved to know that there are institutions like Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva, that help women gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. Dorcas will use this loan to improve her living conditions and assure her four children a secure future. The benefits of the loan will be astronomical, because Dorcas will never again suffer losses due to a delay in delivering produce to the market.

She refers to that night she saw the advert on TV as a \u201crevelation moment\u201d. She called the number on the television screen and was told the requirements for joining the Thrive program. <br \/><br \/>It was not hard for Nyepudzai to find women to join Thrive with as a group. She was already enjoying good relations with three women residing around her neighborhood. These women were fellow business women who were hardworking and with whom she did rotating savings and credits associations with. The members of Our Time group reside in the upcoming high density suburb of Kuwadzana Phase 3 in the capital of Zimbabwe, Harare. The ladies joined Thrive and benefited immensely from the trainings attended.<br \/><br \/>Ladies love accessorizing their outfits with handbags and purses. Nyepudzai realized that this was a good market that she understood well and decided to provide various types of bags for her mostly female clientele. To be able to provide the eye catching bags, this woman endures long and tiring bus journeys to and from neighboring South Africa.  The bad state of roads and long queues at the border posts do little to deter this determined woman. <br \/><br \/>She operates a stall of handbags and purses at an extremely busy and popular marketplace in the central business district of Harare. With a loan of $500, she intends to fully stock her stall since the festive season is fast approaching hence a higher projected demand for handbags and purses.

They have two children, one of whom is still studying in college. The cost of college education is usually pocket-draining, hence Rowena raises hogs at the back of their house to add income for her family. It is a promising enterprise but the return of investment takes several months. She has to advance considerable amount of capital before she earns her profit. As of now, her capital starts to drain and she still has small pigs to raise. <br \/><br \/>She appeals for PHP 29,000 additional capital to buy more feed, medicines and vitamins. In several weeks, she can already sell these medium-sized pigs and she can surely restore her capital. Slowly, she plans to expand her small pigpen hoping that someday it can grow into a big piggery that can supply more consumers in their community and nearby areas. <br \/><br \/>Besides financing her own hog fattening business, she wants to buy a microwave oven for her daughter\u2019s food enterprise. She currently mentors her daughter as she starts her own business.

This is true for Tabitha, 51, who is based in the Chuka area of Kenya and is a mother of two adorable and lovely children. \r\n\r\nShe has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years and managed to earn a decent income. Her primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops, and some personal businesses she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves dairy goat farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, she stated \u201cfeeding my goats\u201d. Her hobby is milking her dairy goat. \r\n\r\nShe sells goat milk to her neighbors and at the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming and she cannot meet the demand. For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy goat, which will assist in increasing milk productivity. The dairy goat she plans to buy is not just an ordinary goat; it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy goat that will produce between 1 to 2 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate into more profit and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used in repaying back the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. \r\n\r\nTabitha is very ambitious. In the near future, she intends to start adding value to her goat milk business by packaging the milk before selling it. She also plans to start selling dairy products such as yogurt. An improved income level will assure her family a secure future.
