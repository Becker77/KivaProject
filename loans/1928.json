This is frustrating for Hildah for many reasons. She hopes that the power will be back in the evening so that she can provide the much needed lighting for her broiler chickens. For broiler chickens to reach a good weight, they need to constantly feed even during the night. So during winter months the lights not only help in their feeding but provide necessary heating. The power cuts affect her seriously especially during the slaughtering time when her chickens have grown and are ready for consumption. She can no longer store dressed chickens for long periods in her freezer as she might lose them to the long hours of load shedding.   Hildah has a very good poultry business and also keeps rabbits for sale.<br \/><br \/>Hildah started the poultry business in the year 2000. She used to keep free range chickens and guinea fowls in her fowl runs as a source of meat for her family. Family and friends encouraged her to keep poultry as a business as she seemed to have a good hand at poultry rearing. She decided to transform her large garage which was not used as a fowl run. She still kept free range chickens and guinea fowls but in her old fowl runs as it is not advisable to mix them with broiler chickens as broilers are very sensitive to many things. She sought advice from agricultural officers and workers from respected poultry on how to rear broilers. They helped her with proper feeding and medicine schedules to help her. Hildah normally keeps 300 chickens at a time in batches of hundreds in different stages.<br \/><br \/>Hildah is a happily married mother to one school going son who is doing his secondary education. She is a member of Kubwinya group which consists of four ladies who have a shared business history and who have been involved in joint income generating projects before.  The group attended all training sessions at Thrive actively participating and sharing their knowledge with members of other groups. The group was given a combined first loan of $1900. <br \/><br \/>Hildah is planning to use her loan to add more batches to her chickens and have 5 batches at different stages of growth.

She is from Moree in the Abura Asebu Kwamankese District of the Central Region of Ghana. Emmanuella is the leader and representative of Bright Future Group. She is married with 2 children aged 12 and 14 years old. Emmanuella's husband is a commercial driver who has been very supportive. She lives with her family. Both of her children are currently attending school. She sells provisions, cosmetics and poultry products to individuals in her locality. <br \/><br \/>Emmanuella visited a nearby community where she met with her friend and other women residents using Elsa Stove for cooking. She then developed the interest of adding to her line of business the distribution of Elsa Stove. Emmanuella has done the necessary market survey in her locality and with very positive results. The stoves use virgin pellets (palm Kernel shells) which are available as waste materials within the communities she operates. There is high demand of Elsa Stoves since they improve indoor air quality and health of the users.

Today, this mother of three children sells milk, eggs, maize and a variety of food crops. She is a passionate farmer and, because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. Dairy farming is close to her heart and every day she wakes up to milk her cow and that makes her very proud. <br \/><br \/>Although she makes profits through milk selling, she lacks a proper dairy unit and she is seeking a loan to build a modern dairy unit.

She is the hardworking, energetic mother of three children. For the past five years she has been a farmer, gaining a lot of practical experience in doing so. Through her farming income she has always assured her family of a decent meal and other basic needs.<br \/><br \/>Jane is now applying for a 20,000 KES loan through Juhudi Kilimo to buy seeds and move into horticultural farming. Kitale has good weather patterns and conditions that support farming activities. It has good roads and a good transportation network. With these favorable conditions she is sure that she will be able to increase her business and reap the maximum in profits.<br \/>Being a woman and accessing funds in Africa is very challenging, but Jane feels relieved knowing there are institutions such as Kiva that help enterprising women like her.

Through a group of 14 members called Kiangoju, Caroline has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi, which use the group-based savings as collateral. According to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled.

She is happily married and has eight children. She has been practicing mixed farming for the last 15 years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs and varieties of food crops from her farmland.  Like many farmers from her region, she finds poultry farming very enjoyable, and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d <br \/><br \/>She lacks funds to increase her poultry farming, and she is seeking a loan of 20,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. Being a woman accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and she will be able to buy more poultry. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate to increased profit margins and an improved income level. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying back the loan and permanently changing her living conditions and securing the future of her school-going children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1999405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-10-19T13:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-18T13:00:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.16},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.43},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.88},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.35},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.83},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.82},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.88},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-19T16:37:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":962186,"name":"Hellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hellen is a dedicated, determined and honest mother of two children.

The loan would help Salamatu increase her capital to be able to earn more income to pay off her loan and support her children. <br \/>Salamatu thanks Kiva for the opportunity to be a supportive mother to her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":459.38,"image":{"id":2001867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy fish, spices and cooking oil for retail.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Karaga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 -2","type":"point"}},"partner_id":346,"posted_date":"2015-10-19T14:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-18T14:50:05Z","loan_amount":3675,"lender_count":132,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ashetu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Azara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rabi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salamatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maami","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abiba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rahima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kuliya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Azaratu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Balchisu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Azaratu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Amatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Zefatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arishetu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":875},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.69},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.69},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.69},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.69},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.69},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.69},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.69},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.69},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.69},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.69},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.69},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.69},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.68},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.68},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":229.68},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":229.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":459.38,"local_amount":1750,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1754.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752092858}],"funded_date":"2015-10-21T22:37:21Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":963949,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine is 47 years old and married with one child.

She is a farmer and salesperson who has access to many sellers throughout the food business. On her farm she keeps dairy animals and has a small cash crop garden and trees. To earn additional income, Linet makes a commission on sales for which she helps arrange the logistics of getting farm produce from local farmers to their buyers. She has been doing this business for over a decade. She continually makes an effort to build strong relationships because reputation is everything in her line of work. Given that Linet can arrange a sale more easily than regular farmers, she prefers to deal with larger volumes of produce. <br \/><br \/>She is seeking a loan to aggregate more produce from local farmers at fair prices and use her better understanding of the market conditions and prices to sell it at a profit.

According to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled. <br \/><br \/>Rosemary is kindly seeking a loan to expand her horticulture farming. <br \/><br \/>In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household. Juhudi Kilimo facilitates loans that empower smallholder farmers like Rosemary because the institution believes that women too are actively involved in various segments of the horticultural industry. <br \/><br \/>For Rosemary, her six children are everything, and she wants them to be successful professionals. That\u2019s why she dreams of paying for the best education for them. You can help Rosemary to accomplish that. A little trust and a loan will make a big difference in her life and in her family\u2019s."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":50.12,"image":{"id":1978233,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He has been doing this work for 40 years and has experience growing coffee. In addition he raises small animals (hens, guinea pigs and more) and grows other products in order to take him his daily bread.<br \/><br \/>This loan will be used to look after and grow one hectare of coffee. It will guarantee a good harvest in 2016. This will be reflected in higher sales and Celestino will therefore earn a higher income in order to improve his and his family's quality of life.<br \/><br \/>Celestino is a new member Edpyme Alternativa. He is signing up to the organisation with his partner."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2002830,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to look after and grow one hectare of coffee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Bagua - Amazonas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-4.5 -78.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2015-10-19T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-18T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celestino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2211,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2211}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-17T05:21:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":964049,"name":"Leah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leah is a married woman with five children.

This is Semei. He is the Head teacher of Karambi Secondary School, a mixed school in the Rural area of Kasese with 450 students. Karambi School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nKarambi School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Semei ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":112.5,"image":{"id":2002356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kasese","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-10-19T18:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-18T18:20:08Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karambi School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3235000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":404375},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":404375},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":404375},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":404375},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":404375},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":404375},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":404375},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":404375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":404375,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":412672.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755507304}],"funded_date":"2015-10-20T16:42:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":964136,"name":"Shenaz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shenaz is 47 years old and a mother of 9 children living with her spouse and children in the area of Multan, Pakistan.
