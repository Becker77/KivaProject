He studied up to high school because of his financial situation. He is married and his wife is an employee and works in the city. He is the father of three children. The first son is in his second year of medical school, the second daughter is in her second year of judicial sciences and the third son is in his third year of high school. Valentin has been working in coffee agriculture for 25 years. His parents would take him to farms to help them, and he got used to walk in the midst of so much vegetation. He liked it so much so that when he was able to do his projects with his own funds, he worked in this activity.  His place of work is at three kilometers from his house. Sometimes, he travels by foot and sometimes by car, and generally he works from 6:00 a.m. to 1:00 in the afternoon. Valentin needs the loan to buy fertilizers, such as sulfate and formula to cultivate coffee and pay for hand labor to help him with these activities.

Since he was the oldest brother of his siblings, he had to work from a young age with his father to give his family their daily sustenance. He is married and his wife works in domestic chores. They have four children, ages 1, 7, 20, and 22-years old, but the older ones do not live with him. <br \/><br \/>Natividad works in agriculture, specifically planting vegetables such as cucumber, green beans, tomato and chilies, but he also grows corn and beans because they are jobs that he has done every day since he was little thanks to his Dad who taught him to cultivate the land. Along with this, he also works with construction projects as a building assistant. These are jobs that get him a good income for him and his family. His day starts at 5:00 AM to move his crops and begin the job of planting and collecting the fruits. His wife helps him to sell and commercialize the products and on some occasions his older children help him. <br \/><br \/>Natividad needs the loan to buy seeds, compost, and fertilizers for the crops, and to build a support for the crops.

Before, she made a living doing housework. The distance she travels to go and sell is 1 kilometer. She goes from house to house selling the merchandise.

Her youngest child is 17 years old.  Kursantkan has a secondary education and, for the past 25 years, she has been involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, two activities which constitute a source of income for her family.  Thanks to her very hard work, she has come to the point where she now has two cows, two horses, and five sheep.

The women of the group Vision are determined to change their communities and families. These women are dedicated to making their businesses succeed. They know that they are not where they want to be but they are on a journey. One member of this group is Ngonidzashe, she is the chairperson of the group.<br \/><br \/>Ngonidzashe is in the poultry business, she also specialises in selling second-hand clothes. She is a widow and is the sole breadwinner of her family of 8. Most of her children and dependents are still school-going and whether they graduate or not depends on Ngonidzashe\u2019s income earning capacity. <br \/><br \/>Ngonidzashe has realised that in order to provide for her family she needs to persevere and work extra hard. Although her poultry business has been growing fairly, she has been finding it hard to keep going. Her batch sizes are small and each poultry cycle produces minimal profits at completion. From the proceeds she has to retain enough working capital to fund growth but she also has to make drawings to sustain her family\u2019s livelihood. Given all this, her growth has been stunted and in many instances she has been threatened by total capital depletion.

As a Babban Gona member, Salihu will benefit from marketing support that could see him generate earnings of up to $2000\/ha. Salihu is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1902722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest .","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-10-20T10:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-19T10:10:04Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salihu Isyaka","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":20068.03,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":20068.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-23T15:40:57Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":964623,"name":"Eteuini","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eteuini is a 41 year old mother with 8 children.

She operates her own sari-sari store (a Filipino-coined term for a small variety store) for a living. The store is occupying a small space of their humble house in Iloilo. Operating for many years now, she has managed to keep the business running and growing.\n\nAt some point, she experiences lack in needed capital to buy her products because she would have to compromise her fund to pay their bills. Instead of buying groceries, she would have to consider the household needs first, what they have to eat for the day, the payment for the electricity and water, etc. There are also instances when neighbors would not pay their credits on time causing her business to suffer.\n\nAgnes has been faithful in her responsibilities and once again she is knocking on the hearts of the ever supportive lenders. By borrowing a supporting capital, she believes this could resolve her inadequacies in business. She hopes to improve her inventory by adding more grocery items like assorted biscuits, sacks of rice, beverages, cooking oil and other common commodities. She is applying for a loan amount of Php 10,000 and praying that her request will be granted. She promised to use the amount for the said purpose and pay it back to the best of her ability.\n\nShe wanted to increase more her sales and expand her store in the next few years. She is a faithful member of Center for Community Transformation. Microentrepreneurs, like Agnes, are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 members. They meet on weekly basis to share the goodness of God in their lives and their experiences on the very unique work of transformation that CCT offers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":90,"image":{"id":1925117,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more supplies to enhance her variety store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Barotac Viejo, Iloilo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-10-20T10:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-19T10:40:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":4000.02,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":4139.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045814}],"funded_date":"2015-10-20T13:12:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":964642,"name":"Delia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Delia is a married woman, 59 years old with four children.

Ahmad is grateful to be part of the Babban Gona family and in the end hopes to use his increased earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1903036,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-10-20T13:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-19T13:20:06Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ahmad Alhaji","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":39082.42,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":39082.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-18T16:36:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":964692,"name":"Savuth's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Savuth\u2019s group live in a rural village in Kampong Speu province in Cambodia.

This is Fred. He is the Head teacher of Namirembe Hill School, a mixed school in the Urban area of Namirembe in Kampala with 300 students. Namirembe Hill School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nNamirembe Hill School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Fred ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2002472,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-10-20T13:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-19T13:20:07Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Namirembe Hill School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3581300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":34,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2018-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":447666}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-22T11:56:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":965730,"name":"Manuel","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" O Senhor  Manuel \u00e9 casado vive na casa propria,ainda n\u00e3o tem filhos mas cuida de um irm\u00e3o mais novo e este estuda,trabalha num centro infantil como professor ja a bastante tempo mas este afirma que sua vida n\u00e3o muda para o melhor apesar de estar a trabalhar, isto porque o salario n\u00e3o cobre com as despesas.Tentou iniciar  uma obra de raiz mais teve que parar porque n\u00e3o tinha mais recursos  para cotinuar foi ent\u00e3o que aproximou se da Hluvuku e solicitou o emprestimo para compra de barotes,portas e janelas para dar continuidade com a sua obra.O seu maior sonho \u00e9 manter como professor mas crescer profissionalmente.O seu maior desafio \u00e9 a forma\u00e7\u00e3o academica.\n\n","en":"Manuel is married and lives in his own house.
