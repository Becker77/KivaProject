successfully repaid her loan, having used it for its intended purpose. She is grateful to the Kiva Fund and to everyone who helped to finance her. Today Lena's farm has four cows, 24 sheep and three horses. She grows alfalfa to feed her livestock on 1.65 hectares of her own land. Her monthly income is about 15,000 som (KGS).

So this is how she ended up making traditional snacks from the Caribe region, and they sold successfully. \r\n\r\nHer neighbors were swept off their feet by her good cooking and they proposed that she keep the business going, but she didn't pay them too much mind. However, a week later she went door-to-door and announced to her neighbors that she was going to start a business and advertised her products.

She not only takes care of her children but has to take care of her three young grandchildren aged 7 and 5 and 4 who have lost both their parents. Malehlohonolo lives in a traditional hut that is not well ventilated, nor warms up well in winter. She works long hours to ensure there is enough food for her children and grandchildren, some of whom are going to school and only help her in the field on Saturdays and Sundays. She has to wake up very early, between 3am and 4am, during the week to start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water and warming the house for all the children before they go to school. <br \/><br \/>Collecting firewood, setting up the fire and doing the actual cooking demands a lot of her time. Temperatures in the Lesotho highlands are never really high; winters can get very cold and often Malehlohonolo has to start the fire inside her hut. Starting a fire releases smog and smoke which when inhaled in large quantities over a period of time can lead to lung diseases, eye problems and in the worst case to death. In these circumstances, life for women like Malehlohonolo has been very difficult. Malehlohonolo has requested a loan from Kiva lenders, in order to be able to purchase clean cook stoves which provide Malehlohonolo and 9 other people from her village, who are living in the same circumstances, the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families, and that does not require a lot of wood, which is hard to find in Lesotho, nor expensive paraffin and gas. <br \/><br \/>This stove can be started with the use of very little, readily available biomass like dry twigs and dry cow dung that do not require lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the homes. This stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery which runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones and a mini LED lamp. A life improving package for these women. This stove saves them time to be with their family, saves energy, eliminates the element of toxic inhalation, house burning and has given them the freedom to have a better lit home to see better in the evening while cooking and enables children to do their homework.

She is a Mother Heroine [honorary title awarded in the Soviet Union for bearing and raising a large family].  She has a secondary education and, by nature, she is responsible, hardworking and industrious.  She's been involved in animal husbandry since her youth.  Thanks to her very hard work, her farming business now brings about 12,000 som (KGS) per month.  She currently has two cows, two horses, four calves and 20 sheep on her farm.  Her children help her with all aspects of the farm work.\r\n\r\nEager to further grow her business, Bermet has turned to Kiva's partner, Bai Tushum, and requested a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) to buy a dairy cow.  Thanks to this purchase she will be able to sell larger volumes of organic milk.  She is planning to use the earnings from her loan to further grow her business.  She also wants to save some money to buy a dowry for her youngest daughter."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":112.24,"image":{"id":2001710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase one dairy cow in order to sell larger volumes of organic milk.

This is Juan's first loan with Emprender in the six years that he has had both businesses.<br \/><br \/>For the above reasons, Juan is applying for a loan in order to buy an industrial sewing machine and to buy cattle for his two businesses."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1999155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cobbler","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle and an industrial sewing machine for two businesses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-10-21T08:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Ramiro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":438.94},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":319.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":324.57},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":364.42},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":363.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":379.64},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":409.94},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":420.55},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":427.15},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":461.6},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":471.81},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":492.53},{"due_date":"2016-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":517.18},{"due_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":532.33},{"due_date":"2016-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":564.83},{"due_date":"2017-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":511.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.27},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.77},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.52},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.36},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.59},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.03},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.58},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.55},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.59},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.09},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.12},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.73},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.95},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.71},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.89}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-19T17:29:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Iain"}},{"id":960694,"name":"Abel","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"45 ans, Abel est un p\u00e8re de famille tr\u00e8s d\u00e9brouillard et responsable.

She has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years and managed to earn a decent income. Her primary source of income has been sheep, eggs, crops and some personal businesses she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves sheep farming and when asked what is most enjoyable about sheep farming, she stated \u201cfeeding my sheep.\" Her hobby is grazing her sheep. She sells wool and mutton to her neighbors and at the local market but the demand has been overwhelming and she cannot meet it. For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy sheep, which will assist in increasing wool and mutton productivity. The sheep she plans to buy is not just ordinary sheep; it\u2019s a quality breed of sheep that will produce more wool and mutton. This will immediately translate into more profit and increased income levels. Profits from selling mutton and wool will be used in repaying back the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. Elizabeth is very ambitious. In the near future, she intends to start adding value to her sheep business by packaging the wool before selling it.

is low in this region. The income from this business is unstable because the price and the amount of fish are related to the weather conditions.\nThe main hardship that Mai faces in her business is the lack of capital. She is requesting a loan to purchase more fish to resell.\nIn 2010, Mai joined Thanh Hoa Microfinance Institution to improve her business. Mai has successfully repaid one loan from Thanh Hoa Microfinance Institution.

He is married with one three-year-old child. At the present time, Penjani runs four Zoona mobile money outlets, and he is looking to keep this momentum going as this will improve his standard of living as well as that of his wife and child. His main objective is to make easy, quick and mostly safe money transfer facilities accessible to everyone in the rural communities of Zambia, and to increase the footprint of his Zoona business in the Eastern region of Zambia. <br \/><br \/>Currently, Penjani uses the revenue generated by his Zoona outlets to generate capital in order to expand his business and be a source of employment in his community. He is also looking to purchase a home for himself and his family, as well as further his education, thus empowering himself so that he is able to plough all his future skill and knowledge back into his business. <br \/><br \/>Being able to run his own business by having been able to open these Zoona outlets has allowed Penjani to keep his family afloat. However, he is now looking to build on that capital base and progressively have his outlets become a more lucrative, sustainable business solution. This would ensure the long-term comfort and peace of mind of himself and those who depend on him, including his family as well as a large part of his community. <br \/><br \/>A huge challenge for Penjani are the constant float shortages he currently experiences, especially when assisting a client who needs to send a large sum of money. This results in him losing clients to other mobile money transfer competitors and also results in his clients losing faith in his services. It also results in him having to close his outlets early and send clients home because he is unable to assist them. These are not the values he wishes to embody nor is it the type of rapport he wants to build with his clients and community members.<br \/>  <br \/>On a broader spectrum, Penjani would like to be able to give back to his community by not only creating employment opportunities and thus helping others achieve the same peace of mind he now currently enjoys, but also by being a viable, trustworthy alternative in a country where banking is simply too expensive for most of the working class. This would not only save his community members' time, but it would also lower their expenses as this would reduce the need to travel long distances in order to send and receive money. One of his objectives is to take safe money transfer facilities to the community, and clients no longer having to spend on travel would make this a reality as well as improve the overall customer experience. He would like to increase his Zoona footprint in the Southern region of Zambia and eventually expand into his home town, Kitwe.<br \/>  <br \/>Zoona has done market research and in so doing have found that the locations in which Penjani is looking to open new outlets would be ideal not only for employment opportunities for those communities, but also to generate the traction he envisions for his business.<br \/><br \/>At the present time, Penjani does not have the necessary capital needed to execute his vision and objective. Connecting with Kiva lenders would jump start his endeavour while simultaneously jump starting opportunities for future employees who are also looking to become entrepreneurs."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2005962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology","Innovative Loans"],"use":"to generate enough capital to expand his Zoona mobile money transfer business into more locations.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZM","country":"Zambia","town":"Chipata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":210,"posted_date":"2015-10-21T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-20T18:00:03Z","loan_amount":3250,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Penjani","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"ZMW","disbursal_amount":39000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":3250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":39000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-10T07:27:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sally Otway","image":1443524}},{"id":962931,"name":"Rudis Evenilson","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rudis vive con su esposa y una hija de 7 a\u00f1os de edad, aprendi\u00f3 de sus padres a cultivar granos b\u00e1sicos, desde hace 8 a\u00f1os lo est\u00e1 haciendo de manera independiente, su horario de trabajo es de ocho de la ma\u00f1ana a cinco de la tarde, cuando recoge las cosechas de ma\u00edz y frijol almacena para poder alimentar a su familia y otra parte la comercializa con sus clientes ya establecidos.\nInvertir\u00e1 el capital en la compra de fertilizantes, fungicidas y f\u00f3liales, espera poder incrementar la producci\u00f3n de ma\u00edz, pues la \u00e9poca de lluvia es bastante favorable en \u00e9ste momento.\nSus sue\u00f1os son continuar mejorando su negocio para tener estabilidad econ\u00f3mica y brindar a su familia una vida con menos carencia.\n","en":"Rudis lives with his wife and a daughter of seven years of age.

With the earnings obtained from the product sold, Deysi hopes to improve the opportunities for her family and make her women's group grow."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2000009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Fair Trade"],"use":"to buy an antivirus blanket, tomato plants, and organic supplies for the construction of a greenhouse.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Capucas, San Pedro Cop\u00e1n, Honduras","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":448,"posted_date":"2015-10-21T18:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-20T18:10:12Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Deysi Marina","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":37,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":14262.89},{"due_date":"2017-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":16544.95},{"due_date":"2018-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":19192.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":656.09},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":761.07},{"due_date":"2018-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":882.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-22T21:27:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Livingston Sutro","image":null}},{"id":965226,"name":"Chinyavu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chinyavu is a married woman with six children.
