The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nBishop Angelo School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

These ladies are focused on transforming their lives through empowerment, small loans and education. They have a vision of raising their standard of living and creating a more prosperous future for themselves and their families. They are selling foodstuffs, wigs, porridge, rice and also provide services like seamstressing and hair dressing. \r\n\r\nHelena, a member of Happiness, is married with one child. She is a 45-year-old trader who has been selling foodstuffs for three years. Helena wants to continue to support her family. Helena buys rice, which is well patronized by customers in her area of residence. She has made a tremendous improvement in her business and so have the other members. The ladies do not know how to read or write and so ID Ghana's training sessions are essential to their success as caretakers of their family and as business entrepreneurs. The training is given in the indigenous language of the women, often with pictures, and covers a variety of subjects including effective business management practices, nutritional and health tools, and self-esteem. \r\n\r\nThe seven women look forward to creating a brighter tomorrow as empowered women eliminating poverty.

An overwhelmingly majority of them hold this as their highest goal. The ladies have had little or no education and so the training held at their monthly meetings is very important to them. They are eager to learn how to manage their loans effectively and learn about budgeting, planning, pricing, marketing, customer service and accounting. They take better care of their families with information about nutrition, hygiene and the use of medicinal plants.

The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank \u201cLas Activas de la 8\u201d was formed by 8 women. The majority of them are mothers who are hard-working and seeking a better future for themselves and their children.\n\nThe Treasurer of the Trust Bank is 46 year old Telma who is married with 4 children (2 boys and 2 girls). She wants to help her husband meet the monthly expenses of the family that include education for the children. The couple understands that education is a key to a better future for them. Telma sells chicken meat and has seen a way to open up a second business. She is going to open a tortilla shop and is requesting a loan to purchase large sacks of corn and lime as well as firewood. She is hopeful that this second business will generate the extra income that is needed by the family. In her words, \u201cThank you for giving me the opportunity to get a loan. I really need it. I\u2019m really happy that I have found a new business that my community really needs. I want to fill that need and open my tortilla shop.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program of Friendship Bridge combines microloans with basic education on everyday topics including budgeting, marketing and sales, nutrition, women\u2019s rights and self esteem.  These educational trainings are presented by a Facilitator from the organization in the indigenous language of the women. As the women have had little or no formal education, there are a lot of pictures, photographs, drawings and role playing.\n\nKIVA investors are greatly valued by Telma and the ladies in the Trust Bank. We look forward to providing a follow-up report on the group in the future.

She runs her business in the \"Plan 3000\" neighborhood, known for the diversity of its inhabitants, who are migrants from the north, victims of the flood from the river.  They took over the area to convert it into a growing neighborhood.<br \/><br \/>Asunta has a dark complexion, long black hair, and a sturdy build.

She shares her life with her partner who works in construction and her children who are in school.  They live in a family-owned home, that has all the basic services.<br \/><br \/>The need to improve her business led her to head up the solidarity group.  The businesses of the members are sale of food, leather handicrafts, sale of natural health products, sale of cosmetics, welding shop, corner store, and bakery.  Asunta's business is the sale of used clothes, which she sells informally in fairs and commercial areas.  \"This summer is coming on strong, and the demand for seasonal clothes won't wait,\" she says.  <br \/><br \/>The advantage of her business is that she sells seasonal clothes.  The disadvantage is the lack of money to buy clothes wholesale.  Her dream is to open a clothing store.  She wants to buy seasonal clothes wholesale.  This is her first round of loans with the institution in the 3 years she has had this business.

The businesses of the other members are: food sales, vegetable sales, domestic electronics repair, second-hand clothing sales, leather goods, key making, cosmetics sales, egg sales, a neighborhood shop and hair styling. <br \/><br \/>She started her baking business from her house with a minimal investment, making tradicional pastries like cu\u00f1ap\u00e9 (a yucca-flour bread ball with cheese), empanada de arroz (baked with rice and cheese), bizcochos de trigo (hard wheat-flour biscuits), and others. <br \/><br \/>\"I want to increase my production so that my children can help me sell...\" she says.

The disadvantage is that he lacks money to buy working materials such as polystyrene, coloured card, glue, etc. He dreams of having his own large, well-known shop.

She is originally from Brazil and is the proud owner of Dance Palooza, a dance and martial arts studio that offers a variety of classes for children and adults in the Harrison area.<br \/><br \/>Originally from Brazil, Elisabete moved to Newark twenty years ago. At a very young age, Elisabete learned the traditional martial art of Capoeira, a Brazilian art form that combines elements of dance, acrobatics, and music in a fun and playful way. <br \/><br \/>Two years ago Elisabete started teaching small classes of Capoeira to children ages 3 and up in Newark. She saw how her classes provided an opportunity for children to exercise and learn a new skill in a non-competitive environment that encourages creativity, discipline, and focus.<br \/><br \/>This past summer, Elisabete decided to open her own location with two studio rooms to offer classes every morning and evening from Monday through Friday. Elisabete's studio now offers Capoeira to children and adults, as well as ballet, tap, hip hop and jazz dance classes. She also offers yoga, Taekwondo, and Zumba. Starting with 80 students, both children and adults, Elisabete is excited to receive new registrations for her classes every day. <br \/><br \/>A Kiva loan from you will help Elisabete install new flooring in one of her studios. Her vision is to turn her studio into a venue where people of all ages can come to learn lifelong skills while building community and having fun."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2000752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to install a beautiful dance floor in her new studio.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Newark","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":316,"posted_date":"2015-10-22T17:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-21T17:20:08Z","loan_amount":5250,"lender_count":171,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elisabete","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":5250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":5250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":408.23},{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":413.34},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":418.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":423.74},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":429.03},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":434.4},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":439.83},{"due_date":"2016-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":445.32},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":450.89},{"due_date":"2016-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":456.53},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":462.23},{"due_date":"2016-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":467.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":408.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":413.34},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":418.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":423.74},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":429.03},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":434.4},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":439.83},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":445.32},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450.89},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":456.53},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":462.23},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":467.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-01T02:26:59Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":965716,"name":"Kousar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kousar, aged 35, is a married woman.

The raising of their children was placed on Dilorom's fragile shoulders. Her husband's work is very hard. Dilorom understands how difficult it is to work in a foreign land.

Despite her hard working to develop her business, her income is not enough anymore to satisfy all her family's expenses. <br \/><br \/>Today, Karima is acquiring a loan from Kiva's field partner, Al Majmoua, to pay her children's school tuition fees. She believes that education can transform a person to live a better life and even in social well-being, and promote good habits, values and awareness. Karima hopes to expand her business in the future, to increase her income and improve her family's living conditions."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2004727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Youth"],"use":"to pay her children's school tuition fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":"Tayouneh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":77,"posted_date":"2015-10-22T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-21T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Karima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":19,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2017-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2017-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2017-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":40.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-23T07:32:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":963031,"name":"Las Aparecidas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Yoselin es una joven mujer de 22 a\u00f1os de edad, soltera, tiene 2 hijos de 1 y 4 a\u00f1os y su negocio es la venta de tamales y horneados.\nElla es buena madre, trabajadora y muy responsable.

She lives with her partner and has 5 children, of 3, 6, 9, 10, and 12 years of age. Her business is selling snacks as a street vendor. She is a good mother, constant, and very hard-working. She carries out her job in the locality of \"El Torno,\" a rural area that is in charge of collecting the agricultural production of the area. <br \/><br \/>Natividad (sitting all the way to the right with her son in her arms) is dark-haired, short in height, and physically robust. Her native tongue is Guarani and she speaks Spanish. She shares her life with her partner, who works in agriculture, and with her sons, who attend school. They live in their own home, constructed of wood, that has electricity and well water.<br \/><br \/>The necessity to better her business led her to lead the communal bank. The members have business like: selling soft-drinks, selling food, making straw hats, making leather crafts, selling pottery, selling second-hand clothes, and running a corner shop. Her business is selling snacks, including sandwiches made with a specific type of loaf bread, ham, and cheese, and which can have chicken and tomato. The varieties depend on the ingredients of the season. \"I sell while traveling, and I go over the same streets where I have regular clients and other casual clients,\" she comments. The advantage of her business is that she counts on established routes with regular clients. The disadvantage is the lack of money to buy cooking supplies like: ham, cheese, bread, etc.<br \/><br \/>Her dream is to have a stable business. She wants to buy cooking supplies to prepare snacks. This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in the 2 years that this activity has been carried out. For these reasons, Natividad asks for a loan to buy cooking supplies to make snacks."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2000631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy kitchen supplies to prepare snacks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-10-22T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-21T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":4875,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Casta Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margoth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ericka Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":33500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":4875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2721.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2951.51},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3058.93},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3170.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3285.68},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3405.28},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3529.23},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3657.7},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3790.84},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3928.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":396.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":429.51},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":445.14},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":461.35},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":478.14},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":495.55},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":513.58},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":532.28},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":551.65},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Bernadette Gardner","image":null}}]}
