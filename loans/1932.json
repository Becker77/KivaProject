She lives with her partner and has 5 children, of 3, 6, 9, 10, and 12 years of age. Her business is selling snacks as a street vendor. She is a good mother, constant, and very hard-working. She carries out her job in the locality of \"El Torno,\" a rural area that is in charge of collecting the agricultural production of the area. <br \/><br \/>Natividad (sitting all the way to the right with her son in her arms) is dark-haired, short in height, and physically robust. Her native tongue is Guarani and she speaks Spanish. She shares her life with her partner, who works in agriculture, and with her sons, who attend school. They live in their own home, constructed of wood, that has electricity and well water.<br \/><br \/>The necessity to better her business led her to lead the communal bank. The members have business like: selling soft-drinks, selling food, making straw hats, making leather crafts, selling pottery, selling second-hand clothes, and running a corner shop. Her business is selling snacks, including sandwiches made with a specific type of loaf bread, ham, and cheese, and which can have chicken and tomato. The varieties depend on the ingredients of the season. \"I sell while traveling, and I go over the same streets where I have regular clients and other casual clients,\" she comments. The advantage of her business is that she counts on established routes with regular clients. The disadvantage is the lack of money to buy cooking supplies like: ham, cheese, bread, etc.<br \/><br \/>Her dream is to have a stable business. She wants to buy cooking supplies to prepare snacks. This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in the 2 years that this activity has been carried out. For these reasons, Natividad asks for a loan to buy cooking supplies to make snacks."}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":4150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2000631,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy kitchen supplies to prepare snacks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-10-22T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-21T22:10:02Z","loan_amount":4875,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Casta Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margoth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ericka Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":33500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":4875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2721.78},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2951.51},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3058.93},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3170.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3285.68},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3405.28},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3529.23},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3657.7},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":3790.84},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3928.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":396.08},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":429.51},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":445.14},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":461.35},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":478.14},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":495.55},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":513.58},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":532.28},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":551.65},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":571.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Bernadette Gardner","image":null}},{"id":965784,"name":"Globe1 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Imelda is the featured borrower in Globe1 group.

Benefiting from Babban Gona\u2019s marketing support, Hafizu has the opportunity to generate earnings of up to $2000\/ha. \n\nHafizu is thankful that he no longer has to worry about having no money to increase his farmland and looks forward to using his additional earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1887415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest .","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-10-22T23:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-21T23:00:09Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hafizu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":14625.6,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":14625.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-23T06:29:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":965870,"name":"Yahaya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yahaya is a maize farmer and Babban Gona member.

With the opportunity to earn up to 2,000 USD\/hectare, Saidu hopes to realize better yields and plans on using his additional income to move into a better home with his family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1960774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating the pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-10-23T00:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-22T00:20:08Z","loan_amount":50,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saidu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":5130.15,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":50,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":5130.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-23T03:59:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":965888,"name":"Neriman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Neriman's husband is deceased and she has three children.

There, she currently is selling only groceries. Currently she is asking for another loan to be able to purchase a greater variety of products which will allow her to get more customers since her customers always ask for a greater variety of products and, so, she hopes to stock her store more and, in this way, get more income for her life. <br \/><br \/>She will use this loan to stock her store more, she will purchase rice, sugar, oil, detergents, and other products.

Iliyasu is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to ensure that all his children get a university  education"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2005020,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-10-23T12:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-22T12:10:06Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Iliyasu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":16330.83,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":16330.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-23T16:10:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michael Angelilli","image":1331534}},{"id":963076,"name":"Georgina Monserrate","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En el barrio Cuba de la ciudad de  Manta,  ciudad conocida por sus hermosas playas que son muy visitadas en toda \u00e9poca del a\u00f1o, por turistas nacionales y extranjeros y por  ser uno de los puertos m\u00e1s importantes del pa\u00eds y de Am\u00e9rica situado a orillas del Pacifico, cada 15 d\u00edas se re\u00fane el Grupo de Cr\u00e9dito Las Incre\u00edbles.\nEn este lugar vive la se\u00f1ora Georgina, tiene 18 a\u00f1os de edad, mantiene una relaci\u00f3n de uni\u00f3n libre pero aun no tienen  hijos.

JMV operates a milk collection and distribution center for the people in his community and neighboring refugee camp.\n\nMany families in the district own cows, and these cows often produce more than that family consumes. So JMV buys the excess milk from the families and sells it to people who don't have cows, people in the neighboring refugee camp, and local restaurants. He also runs a program for vulnerable children in the village to come to the collection center in the afternoon for a free cup of milk.\n\nAEC has been working with JMV for nearly two years. We started supporting him by giving him a loan for a tricycle to distribute milk nearby the center. Now, JMV has outgrown the tricycle and is looking for financing to purchase a truck.\n\nWith this truck, JMV will be able to collect and distribute 3 times the amount of milk as he does today. This truck would also allow him to go into more remote places in the district.\n\nJMV is one of the most responsible entrepreneurs we've ever worked with. He keeps meticulous records and every week he meets with new potential partners, suppliers and buyers. He hasn't been able to capitalize on as many as he would like, but with this truck he will be able to do so.\n\nThank you so much for your consideration and support for JMV!\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":14500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2008135,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Growing Businesses"],"use":"To buy a truck to increase capacity at the milk collection center.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Nyamagabe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":319,"posted_date":"2015-10-23T15:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-22T15:00:04Z","loan_amount":14500,"lender_count":426,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jean Marie Vianney","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":14500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":14500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2017-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2017-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2017-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":966.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":966.67},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":966.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-29T07:57:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":965999,"name":"Marjo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marjo is 40 years old and lives together with his wife and two children.

She then constructed a cabin structure with a lot of help from her husband in Kuwadzana Extension, a high density suburb where they live. She set up the cabin as a salon from where she did women\u2019s hair and makeup, which she did for about eight years until the market become more competitive and the business became very slow. In December 2013 she constructed a fowl run and changed the salon cabin into a brooder. <br \/><br \/>Tsitsi would brood the day-old chicks in the brooder for the first two weeks and then move them to the fowl run. She started with a batch of 50 birds even though her fowl run had the capacity to carry 200 birds because she lacked enough capital and experience. In the early stages of her business, she faced challenges that included high mortality rate due to inexperience and failure to get customers for her chickens. <br \/><br \/>Tsitsi attended a poultry seminar arranged by Irvine\u2019s, a poultry breeder. At this seminar, she learned how to take care of chickens as they grow, the right amounts of feed and water, and what medication to give to the chickens as well as when to call for a vet if the batch got diseased. She also got some marketing tips from the Irvine\u2019s trainers as well as from the other attendees present. She applied these marketing skills she learned at the seminar and she got a good response from customers. In August 2014 she managed to increase her batch size to 100 birds at a time, by year end she was doing a three-week cycle and still produced the same good quality birds. <br \/><br \/>Tsitsi has received financial literacy training from Thrive Microfinance and believes that the knowledge she received will help her boost her business. Being a mother of two, from the profits of her business, she has managed to assist her husband in providing a formal education for their children. Gugulami is a four-member group and Tsitsi is one of the hardworking women in this group.  They are requesting a loan for $1250. Tsitsi wants to use her portion to finance her poultry business to meet demand for chickens in her neighborhood."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2005077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to further extend her fowl run and buy more chicks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-10-23T15:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-22T15:30:07Z","loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vimbayi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tsitsi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lindiwe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":208.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-24T16:24:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marsha Berkowitz","image":402980}},{"id":965945,"name":"Magai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Magai,who is in his mid 40's is married with four kids, three girls and one boy, all of whom are in school.

Bello is grateful to be part of the Babban Gona family and in the end hopes to use his increased earnings to move into a better home with his family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2005461,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating the pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-10-23T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-22T16:30:03Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bello","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":33647.52,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":33647.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-25T18:29:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":966220,"name":"Jenet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jenet is a maize farmer and Babban Gona member.

Magaji is grateful to be part of the Babban Gona family and in the end hopes to use his increased earnings to buy maize grinding machines."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2005104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest .","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-10-23T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-22T17:10:05Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Magaji","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":27332.25,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":27332.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-25T03:09:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":960981,"name":"Rutemba Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"C'est depuis les ann\u00e9es 1999 que les membres du groupe RUTEMBA ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 cultiver la tomate.

I like photography a lot as I can express the art I have inside me. I have not started University yet due to the lack of financial means. I need the loan as with it I can cover the necessary expenses of the course and the university. If I don't receive the loan I won't be able to study for now and will have to go to work until I save enough money needed to cover the university costs. It will affect me as if I have to quit my studies to work, this will delay my studies and my desire to be a professional. As to my studies in school I was a good student and won awards for being outstanding.<br \/><br \/>Amongst my academic goals I want to be one of the students with the highest academic standing. I want to be outstanding in my field and be able to complete my studies with the utmost competence in my degree. My family is ready to give all the support needed to contribute to any need within their means. My personal goal is to grow as a responsible and supportive person within my ability to develop my career and continue to stand out as an industious person, as I see myself.

Benefiting from Babban Gona\u2019s marketing support, Haruna has the opportunity to generate earnings of up to $2000 per hectare. <br \/><br \/>Haruna is thankful that he no longer has to worry about having no money to provide healthcare for his family and children and looks forward to using his additional earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2005745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest .","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-10-23T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-22T20:50:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Haruna","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":36584,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":36584}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-25T18:29:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":963759,"name":"Glenda Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Glenda, de 33 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta bachillerato, se cas\u00f3 cuando ten\u00eda 18 a\u00f1os de edad, su esposo se dedica a los trabajos de la agricultura y juntos tienen dos hijos que estudian nivel b\u00e1sico en la comunidad.\n\nGlenda, tiene una peque\u00f1a tienda desde hace aproximadamente ocho a\u00f1os, inicio este peque\u00f1o negocio porque no hab\u00edan tiendas de productos de primera necesidad cerca de la comunidad y las personas ten\u00edan que caminar una larga distancia; pero a parte de eso tambi\u00e9n tiene un peque\u00f1o molino de nixtamal, con el cual brinda servicio a la comunidad y tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la siembra de granos b\u00e1sicos como ma\u00edz y frijol.\n\nGlenda, necesita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar cuatro quintales de abono, pagar mano de obra e invertir en la tienda para aumentar su inventario y as\u00ed poder tener m\u00e1s ofertas a sus clientes y el resto del dinero lo necesita para arreglar el molino y poder garantizar un mejor servicio de calidad. \n\nGlenda, sue\u00f1a con mejorar su vivienda porque es de adobe y no es muy segura debido a las lluvias las cuales van lavando las paredes de la casa, y seguir siempre apoyando a sus hijos en los estudios para que se superen y sean profesionales.","en":"Glenda is 33 years old and left school after getting her high school diploma.
