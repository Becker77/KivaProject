She lives with her husband and her children in a Thai ethnic traditional house in a remote village where people mainly rely on agricultural production for a living. Like other villagers, Ngan works very hard at cultivation and animal husbandry with several activities such as growing rice and raising pigs, chickens and ducks while her husband works as a driver.

As a Babban Gona member, he has the opportunity to achieve yields of up to eight metric tonnes of maize per hectare of land, 5.5 times the yield of the average Nigerian farmer. \r\n\r\nTraditionally, Sani would have had to sell his maize for low prices at harvest to meet his immediate cash needs.

Her dream is to run her own business, but lack of capital is a huge obstacle in making this dream a reality. Currently, the economy in Malawi makes it difficult for young people to find gainful employment. This makes it difficult for Trinity to support herself and her family. She believes that becoming a Zoona agent and running her own business will turn his situation around. <br \/><br \/>Trinity has a diploma in marketing management and she would like to make a success of running a mobile money transfer business in Blantyre.  Trinity will use the revenue generated to further her education and plow all that knowledge back into her business and her community. She loves working with people and she would like to use her business to create employment opportunities for others. <br \/><br \/>On a broader spectrum, Trinity would like to be able to give back to her community by not only creating employment opportunities and thus helping others achieve peace of mind, but also to be a viable, trustworthy alternative in a country where banking is simply too expensive for most of the ordinary people.<br \/> <br \/>This would not only save her community member\u2019s time, but it would also lower their expenses as this would reduce the need to travel long distances in order to send and receive money. <br \/>One of her objectives is to take safe money transfer facilities to the community, and clients no longer having to spend on travel would make this a reality as well as improve the overall customer experience. She would like to increase her Zoona footprint in Malawi. She also hopes to influence some of the young people in her family to become entrepreneurs like her. <br \/>Zoona has done market research and in so doing has found that, with Blantyre being the second largest city in Malawi, the location in which Trinity is looking to open her outlet, would be ideal not only for employment opportunities for that community, but also to generate the traction she envisions for her business. <br \/>Trinity thanks the Kiva lenders for their support in her endeavor."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1999654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology"],"use":"to procure a Zoona branded trolley and an internet enabled phone as well as the funds needed to make the actual transactions so that she can start running her own business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MW","country":"Malawi","town":"Blantyre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.5 34","type":"point"}},"partner_id":444,"posted_date":"2015-10-24T13:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-23T13:50:04Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Trinity","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MWK","disbursal_amount":516500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":516500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-30T16:54:44Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":966596,"name":"Llesh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Llesh is in the photograph with his wife, Marije and they are in their early 50s and parents of two children, 20 and 17 with the older one studying in a public university.

She would like to increase her Zoona footprint in Malawi. <br \/>Zoona has done market research and in so doing have found that, with Lilongwe being the largest city in Malawi, the location in which Farida is looking to open her outlet would be ideal not only for employment opportunities for that community, but also to generate the traction she envisions for her business. <br \/>Farida thanks the Kiva lenders for their support in her endeavour."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1999608,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology"],"use":"to procure a Zoona branded trolley and an internet enabled phone as well as the funds needed to make the actual transactions so that she can start running her own business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MW","country":"Malawi","town":"Lilongwe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.5 34","type":"point"}},"partner_id":444,"posted_date":"2015-10-24T15:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-23T15:40:05Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Farida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MWK","disbursal_amount":516500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":516500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-26T14:37:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":966550,"name":"Puente A Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Microcredit loans are effective in developing countries like Guatemala where wage paying jobs are scarce and people survive through self-employment using their skills such as weaving, embroidery, raising livestock and poultry, or growing fruits and vegetables.

Sis looking to tap into the potential that Blantyre has and start running her own business.<br \/><br \/>At 23 years old, Madalo is the youngest in a family of six. She has a certificate in Human Resources and is passionate about business management. Her dream is to run her own business, but lack of capital is a huge obstacle in making this dream a reality. The biggest contributing factor to her wanting to run a successful business is the fact that she would like to use the funds generated to put her four younger sisters through school.<br \/><br \/>Currently, the economy in Malawi makes it difficult for young people to find gainful employment. This makes it difficult for Madalo to support herself and her family. She believes that becoming a Zoona agent and running her own business will turn her situation around. <br \/>Madalo would like to make a success of running a mobile money transfer business in Blantyre and eventually using the revenue generated to further her education and plough all that knowledge back into her business and her community. She loves working with people and she would like to use her business to create employment opportunities for others.<br \/> <br \/>On a broader spectrum, Madalo would like to be able to give back to her community by not only creating employment opportunities but helping others achieve peace of mind. Madalo hopes that her business will be a viable, trustworthy alternative in a country where banking is simply too expensive for most of the ordinary people.<br \/> <br \/>This would not only save her community member\u2019s time, but it would also lower their expenses as this would reduce the need to travel long distances in order to send and receive money. <br \/>Zoona has done market research and in so doing have found that, with Blantyre being the second largest city in Malawi, the location in which Madalo is looking to open her outlet would be ideal not only for employment opportunities for that community, but also to generate the traction she envisions for her business. <br \/>Madalo thanks the Kiva lenders for their support in her endeavour."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1999449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Mobile Technology"],"use":"to procure a Zoona branded trolley and an internet enabled phone as well as the funds needed to make the actual transactions so that she can start running her own business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MW","country":"Malawi","town":"Blantyre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.5 34","type":"point"}},"partner_id":444,"posted_date":"2015-10-24T17:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-23T17:20:07Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Madalo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MWK","disbursal_amount":516500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":516500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-26T21:54:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":966780,"name":"Samoeun's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samoeun\u2019s group lives in a rural village in Kandal province, Cambodia.

Benefiting from Babban Gona\u2019s marketing support, Saidu has the opportunity to generate earnings of up to $2000\/ha. \n\nSaidu is thankful that he no longer has to worry about having no money to provide healthcare for his family and children and looks forward to using his additional earnings to buy maize grinding machines"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2005445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-10-24T18:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-23T18:10:08Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saidu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":33749.88,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":33749.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-19T14:04:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":966531,"name":"Mustafa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mustafa deals in produce buying and selling alongside farming of maize to get additional income.

This makes it difficult for Sadrech to start running his own business so that he can support himself and his family. He believes that becoming a Zoona agent and running his own business will turn his situation around. <br \/>Sadrech would like to make a success of running a mobile money transfer business in Blantyre and eventually using the revenue generated to further his education and plough all that knowledge back into his business and his community. <br \/>One of Sadrech\u2019s objectives is to provide safe money transfer facilities to the community, so that clients no longer have to spend money on travel to access financial services. His dream is to grow his business and help increase Zoona's footprint in Malawi. <br \/>When Sadrech receives this loan, he will be able to start running his own business by purchasing a trading trolley, a mobile phone and having the funds needed to serve customers.
