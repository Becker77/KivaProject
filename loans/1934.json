With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Nuhu can store his maize and sell it in the future for up to 37% higher than the market price at harvest.<br \/><br \/> Nuhu is grateful to be part of the Babban Gona family and in the end hopes to use his increased earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2005453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest .","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-10-25T01:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-24T01:50:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nuhu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":40827.08,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":40827.08}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-23T13:50:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":966955,"name":"So\u00e1i","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr So\u00e1i is 38 years old and he is married.

This will be reflected in the increase in sales and thereby in the income he receives, with which he will be able to continue looking after the welfare of his family.

Safarbibi took over her father's business in 1998 and has developed it since then.  Her grandfather and father also used to be involved in animal husbandry, so Safarbibi decided to follow in their footsteps.  Safarbibi has a barn at home where she raises small livestock.

This is John Peter.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>St. Hermans School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

This situation led Albertina to start a small informal business selling capulanas (sarongs) and other clothing door to door.  With the little she earned she was able to pay for her children's schooling, but this wasn't  enough for her family situation.  <br \/><br \/>Facing this situation, Albertina changed businesses and opened a shop to sell groceries,  This was also the moment that she learned about Hluvuku.  Since them she has always benefited from loans.  This is her fifth loan with Hluvuku and with the money she plans to purchase products for her shop such as sugar, rice, corn meal, potatoes, soft drinks, beer, and hair for female beauty needs. Her greatest dream is to continue to be a client of Hluvuku and to grow her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2005617,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Victors School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

Marylove ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve her students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":106.25,"image":{"id":2007155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-10-25T17:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-24T17:40:08Z","loan_amount":850,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Circle Of Peace School","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3035000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379375},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":379375},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":379375},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379375},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":379375},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":379375},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":379375},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":379375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":106.25,"local_amount":379375,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-25T13:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":384465.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":755507309}],"funded_date":"2015-10-25T23:39:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Etchison","image":null}},{"id":967410,"name":"Misesa Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joyce is 29 years old and divorced.

Another awesome perk: they have one-month-to-pay credit for any goods they get. They just have to browse from brochures, place orders, and wait for a day or two for the direct selling representative (or dealer) to deliver the orders, then pay the amount by installment in a month\u2019s stretch.\r\n\r\nJoy, 54 years old, from Bacolod City, Negros Occidental, is into direct selling business. She has different brochures of known brands such as Ever Bilena, Natasha, Personal Collection, Dakki, Avon, and Marikina Shoe Exchange. She shows these brochures to her customers where they can choose from different line of products. There are cosmetics, toiletries, RTWs, footwear, bags, even pillows and household needs. Usually, dealers have 25% discount (or higher) of brochure price, which serves as their profit. They also earn from rebates, recruitment rewards, etc.\r\n\r\nJoy meticulously studies the specifications of every product in her brochures so she can easily answer the queries of her customers. Because of this positive attitude, she has gained their trust and confidence. Now she is expanding her network of target customers.\r\n\r\nShe is expecting a higher demand for her products as the peak season of Christmas approaches. Therefore, she has applied for additional capital worth 20,000 PHP to meet this. Her continuous income adds up to the monthly pension of her husband, Roquito, and supports their usual needs and college expenses of their youngest child.\r\n\r\nShe desires good health, brighter future for her children, and harmonious relationship among her family.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase two UV water treatment systems with 450 litre & 1000 litre tanks, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Teso College School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Sylvester ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students\u2019 concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases.

It has contributed a lot in providing for her children\u2019s needs and education. Now she uses her income to extend financial help to her grandchildren. In the Philippines, where families are known to be so closely knit, parents\u2019 responsibilities don\u2019t just end with their children but also extend to their grandchildren as long as they can. In return, grandchildren are always there to assist and accompany their grandparents.<br \/><br \/>As Nenita continues to improve her variety store business, she wants to obtain PHP 32,000 in supplementary capital to buy more dry goods, grocery items, and soft drinks to enhance her inventory. Your kind support will surely extend to her whole family and grandchildren. She consistently meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to inspire each other through sharing of life\u2019s testimonies and reflection on the Word of God.<br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

As a Babban Gona member, Hannatu will benefit from marketing support that could see her generate earnings of up to $2000\/ha. <br \/><br \/>Hannatu is thankful that she now has the opportunity to improve the life of her children and family and looks forward to using her additional earnings to ensure that all her children get a university  education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2007453,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-10-25T19:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-24T19:40:05Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hannatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":18282,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":18282}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-26T03:41:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":964388,"name":"Mario","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr  Mario es una persona muy luchadora  trabaja a la vez que estudia la carrera de derecho, al terminar su carrera  le gustar\u00eda desempe\u00f1ar en el \u00c1rea que est\u00e1 estudiando.\nMario pone todo su esfuerzo para poder ser un buen profesional y por medio de sus estudios poder mejorar sus condiciones de vida.\nPide este pr\u00e9stamo para poder pagar las cuotas de su carrera y as\u00ed poder seguir con sus estudios.   \n","en":"Mario is hard-working and determined.
