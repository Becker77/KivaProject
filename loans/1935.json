The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

She lives in Atl\u00e1ntida, Honduras and she knows the benefits of solar-generated electricity. A number of years ago, she acquired such a system because there is no electric power in her community. As time passed and as she used her system, a few of the system's components have broken and she had to deactivate the system. She hasn't had enough money to reactivate it. \r\nRosario has a business selling basic foodstuffs and toiletry items. Three years ago she also began cultivating african palm trees, which she does along with the support of her husband, who lives out of the country and helps her care for their two children. \r\nShe needs to reactivate her electricity system to improve the service to her customers by providing better lighting. This will also enable her children to study without difficulty. For this reason, Rosario requests a loan from Soluz Honduras, which will help her purchase a package of sustainably-produced products which her solar system needs in order to be reactivated. This way she will again enjoy the benefits which it offers to her, her family and the community.

Stars are known to be bright and are linked with goodness.  It was these characteristics of stars that they wanted to bring out in themselves that made Six Stars group take up that name. Their objective as women in business is to shine brightly providing guidance and mentoring to other women around them who want to empower themselves economically.  Their dedication in using their hands has been fruitful as a means of survival.  In the present state of the economy, the dollar is elusive and few are actually managing to access it. Six Stars has proved they have the strength and the will to earn that precious dollar. <br \/><br \/>Tendai and the other 3 members of Six Stars are on a successive second loan. She is a married woman, 35 years old and a mother of 3. She resides in Kuwadzana 5 in the capital city of Zimbabwe, Harare. She has proved beyond doubt that she has business acumen which just needed some persuasion to be released.  Attending training sessions at Thrive helped her tap into her hidden potential and helped her become a better entrepreneur. <br \/><br \/>Tendai was given a loan of $300 on her 1st loan cycle and equipped with knowledge on how to grow her business through borrowings. Tendai wasted no time in applying that knowledge. She traveled approximately 475 km from Harare to Beira, in Mozambique, in search of very durable and quality fishing nets. She bought different types of fishing nets including 300\u00d7100 and of size 4 being the type that sinks deeper in the dams, lakes, etc. because they are so long and their catch is usually of bigger and better size. <br \/><br \/>She supplies the fishing nets to different fisheries surrounding one of the most popular and attractive lakes near Harare, Lake Chivero. She usually supplies them the 300 by 100 nets and the 200 by 100 nets which she also supplies.  On top of that she supplies another market with 100 by 100 nets. This market consists of fisheries located in Darwendale dam near Harare. She is so knowledgeable about the fishing nets to the extent that one would mistake her for a fisherwoman.<br \/><br \/>Currently she requires a loan of $500 so as to restock from Maputo, Mozambique.  This is approximately 928 km from Harare, Zimbabwe. She discovered that the nets from Maputo are more durable and cheaper in price. She also intends to restock the fishing nets in bulk so as to supply her clients whilst it is summer time when the fishing season is at its peak."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2007930,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to restock fishing nets from Maputo, Mozambique as they are stronger and cheaper than those she currently sells.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-10-26T12:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-25T12:20:03Z","loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tendai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2016-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2016-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-27T08:22:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michael Angelilli","image":1331534}},{"id":965469,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El es un joven casado hace un par de a\u00f1os, su esposa esta en espera de su primer hijo despu\u00e9s de recibir un tratamiento ya que no pod\u00eda embarazarse.

Customers keep coming back again and again due to its savory taste and aroma. This maybe the reason why chicken inasal is one of the icon products of this region. \n\nJocelyn, 48 years old, a resident of Naga City, Cebu chose the right business to venture into. She runs a chicken barbecue stand for almost twenty years. Her husband, Cresaldo, a laborer, helps her in her business whenever he has time. They have children to whom they want to dedicate all their efforts. The couple works hard to support their children\u2019s education until its completion. It\u2019s their aspiration to improve the quality of living for them. \n\nHowever, Jocelyn also struggles a lot especially when the income from her business becomes unstable. Due to proliferation of many barbecue stands in their area, the competition gets stiff. Jocelyn longs to run her business consistently to gain better and steady income. You might be a great help to her through PHP 50,000 loan that she will use to buy volume of dressed chicken, sacks of charcoal, and additional ingredients for her business.

She has three children, aged 8, 12 and 16, and works selling second-hand clothing. She is a good mother, honest and very kind. She runs her business in the southern part of the city, which contains most of the city's population and is known for its manufacturing businesses.\r\n\r\nMery is short, with grey hair and wrinkles (in the centre, wearing a white top and spotted trousers). Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed and she speaks Spanish. She lives with her partner, who is an electrician, and her children, who are in school. They live in a rented brick room with water, electricity and sewage services. \r\n\r\nThe need to improve her business brought her to lead this communal bank. The members run businesses such as: selling fast food, selling dairy products, selling food, selling soft drinks, selling cosmetics, selling natural products and tyre fitting. Her business involves selling second-hand clothing. She buys bundles of clothing and separates them out by gender, age and time of year. Once separated, she sells the goods as a street vendor in pedestrian areas and commercial districts. \"I always separate out damaged clothing for better sales,\" she says. \r\n\r\nThe advantage of her business is that she sells her products normally. The disadvantage is the lack of money for buying bundles of clothes. She dreams of having enough capital to be able to buy these goods. She wants to buy second-hand clothing in bulk, so she can separate it and sell it by gender and age-group. This is the first loan series from the institution in her 27 years of carrying out this activity.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Mery is requesting a loan to buy second-hand clothing in bulk and sell it by gender and age-group.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":264.68,"image":{"id":2003072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy second-hand clothes in bulk and sell them by gender and age-group.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-10-26T15:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-25T15:10:02Z","loan_amount":3625,"lender_count":83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Peregrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alison Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ximena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ninoska","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Datty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marco Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1825.35},{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1923.56},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1958.57},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1994.22},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2030.51},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2007.93},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2155.73},{"due_date":"2016-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2143.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2147.32},{"due_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2247.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2262.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":2303.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":264.68},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":278.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":283.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":289.16},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":294.42},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":291.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.58},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":310.77},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":311.36},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325.95},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":328.03},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":264.68,"local_amount":1825.35,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T15:08:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1828.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752077248}],"funded_date":"2015-10-28T22:50:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katy Robinson","image":1071390}},{"id":966873,"name":"Thelma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thelma is 33 years old, married, and has three children who are in school.<br \/><br \/>Thelma is in the agricultural business of raising pigs in the Philippines.

She would sell her cross border wares to people around her neighbourhood and in companies in town. After she realised that she had to pause crossing because of the young infant in her care, Maria decided to restock grocery items and snacks for selling by her gate side. She also liaised with her relatives overseas to send her good second-hand clothing to sell to the low income market. She then sells both clothing and groceries, thereby managing to earn an honest living.<br \/><br \/>Maria joined Thrive Microfinance along with other members from her group, called Super.

She is also the one who regularly checks on the records of the older women to see if they are doing everything correctly. <br \/><br \/>With a loan from Kiva, Maria would like to buy new children\u2019s clothing to sell.
