","en":"Idibek is the happy father of three children.  His oldest daughter is already married, his second child is 18, and his third is still a young boy.  Idibek is well educated and he has a positive attitude towards life.  He is 45 years old and lives with his family in the Bohtar district of Tajikistan.  This particular district enjoys a beautiful weather and plenty of sunshine, which is suitable to agriculture.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450-liter tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Kirimya Vocational School will repay its loan from the school fees collected each term.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term, as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

Because of his secondary education and high unemployment rate in the region, Giorgi has been unable to start a stable job so he wants to make his own source of income and private activity. \r\n\r\nAccording to Credo's estimations, the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. Giorgi requested a loan from local financial institutions several times but without any success. His loan request was approved in the framework of a joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. The startup loan program envisages provisions for business startups and re-startup credits with soft conditions for the country's rural poor, who, regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income, do not have access to credit products. Giorgi has been approved for a loan of 4,000 GEL, which he plans to use for purchasing a secondhand car and to start providing taxi services. He will be the driver and will serve the local people and get a daily income. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva startup loan, will significantly increase the family's income and Giorgi will be able to create better living conditions for his family.

At the comfort of your own home you can manage your own store. Filipinos prefer to buy items in a Sari-sari store since most are just located in neighborhoods, Barangays and barrios without spending fair going to cities just to buy items. Sari-sari is a Filipino word which means \u201cvariant\u201d where items are cheaper since products are purchase on wholesale but being sold by piece, kilos or by volume to consumers. Candies, biscuits, seasonings, can goods and such are being sold by piece. Peanut butter, mayonnaise and other spreads are being sold by volume while rice and animal feeds are measured by kilos.<br \/><br \/>Nurhaya is one of the members of Center for Community Transformation (CCT), a housewife and a Sari-sari store owner. She enjoys managing the store since she can take care of her family while doing the business. Indeed, this became a medium for her in supporting her family\u2019s needs. However, not all the time she earns enough profit. She still needs capital to buy additional products so that her store will offer complete products to customers. <br \/><br \/>She applied for a loan amount of P15, 000 that will be used as an added capital since she aims to expand the business and continually be able to support her children\u2019s education. The amount will be used to buy grocery products like can goods, sugar, oil, bottled drinks and other grocery items.<br \/><br \/>On a weekly basis, Nurhaya regularly meets with her co-fellowship members to share her life\u2019s testimony, experience on the business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and listen to the Word of God. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 members. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social relationship with other partners, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":21.67,"image":{"id":2007447,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To expand the business by adding grocery products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Intramuros, Manila City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-10-27T07:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-26T07:50:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nurhaya ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.67,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1006.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045839}],"funded_date":"2015-10-27T10:25:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":967828,"name":"Julieta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julieta works hard to support her family.
