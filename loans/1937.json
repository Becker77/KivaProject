With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. <br \/><br \/>Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Rakai PTC School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Patrick ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2008072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Rakai","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-10-27T15:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-26T15:40:05Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rakai Ptc School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3581300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":34,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2018-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":447666}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-28T05:36:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":966132,"name":"Rosa Isela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa Isela es una mujer sonorense trabajadora, entregada a su familia y orgullosa por su esp\u00edritu de lucha.

But when Center for Community Transformation (CCT) approved her previous loan application, it became a way to increase her daily sales as she was able to buy daily ingredients for her food business. \n\nMost of the amount earned on the business were being used for their day-to-day expenses. Revolving fund is what she wants to retain so that on a daily basis she\u2019ll have spare budget to buy ingredients needed for her food business. Currently, she\u2019s also managing a variety store business that she wants to be progressive as well.

Most of the inhabitants are dedicated to working in the field; many of them are farmers, others only laborers. However, the best part of the community are the typical sweets prepared with love in various homes. <br \/><br \/>Dulcero is the name of a 12-working women who have always given their all to give the best to their families. The group name refers, as already mentioned, the confectionery tradition of the region. The members are: Paula, who sells food and tamales; Cecilia, hats and food; Mary, pizza and footwear; Norma, sugar cane; Martina, soft drinks; Diana, traditional sweets; Brenda, footwear by catalog; Ma. Antonia, footwear and tamales.; Rosa, lingerie; Guadalupe, clothing; Angela, groceries and Juana, who raises poultry. <br \/><br \/>Diana and her husband, Jose Luis, became parents 10 months ago. While he works in the field, she prepares and sells traditional sweets of the region. Since childhood, she watched her mother and grandmother prepare delicious recipes for sweet coconut milk, ates (a fruit sweet) and alfajores (a small cookie) made of corn and rice, to name a few. \"I like making candy. It'ss an activity that has been a source of income for many generations in my family,\" she said cheerfully.<br \/><br \/>Currently, she's been providing the family recipe for three years. She has a lot of confidence in her product and, despite the competition that exists in the community, manages to sell an average of 170 to 220 candies per week. <br \/><br \/>The proceeds enable her to support her husband with the household expenses and reinvest in her business. The loan will be invested in the purchase of brown sugar, cheese, corn, rice, squash seed, coconut, sesame, pineapple, cinnamon and bags to package all her production, which has fortunately increased. Her main objective is to create a brand of candy in order to become a micro entrepreneur.<br \/><br \/>* The photograph was taken at Brenda's house. Diana sits behind Ma.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen.

The members call their group El Gigante because they hope to grow their small enterprises from small businesses to large ones.  All of the members are Mazahua, though none speak the Mazahuan language.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda del Carmen is one of the group's most enthusiastic members and the other members tell us that they value her enthusiasm and good humor.  She has operated a corner grocery for more than 18 years, a business that she started because she needed the income and had no one to rely on but herself.  She sells lots of different products now, at reasonable prices and her customers come back again and again because she provides an excellent service.  She normally opens the shop at 7:00am and stays open until 8:00pm, long hours that give her an advantage over other local groceries.  \"Many other groceries have opened in the neighborhood over the years\", she says, \"so I have had to work harder to make sure that my customers continue to shop at my store\".  Mar\u00eda del Carmen is applying for a loan that she will use to stock her business with soft drinks, juices, toiletries and other merchandise.  She is very happy with VF Mexico, she says, because she has been able to make the most of the loans she's received to build her business.  For the future, she hopes to open a second store in the town or one of the surrounding towns.  \r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are: Joaqu\u00edn, who has a taxi business; Jaime, who operates a bakery; Ma.

She has a secondary education and very good references from her neighbors. They consider her to be a responsible and honest woman. To provide the primary income for her family, Ubadat has been involved in animal husbandry and farming for 22 years. Her farm contains 4 cows and 22 sheep. Additionally, Ubadat has 3.0 hectares of land, where she grows beans, tobacco and corn for sale.

Her mother-in-law urged her to start the business because she knew from experience that it would bring a good income.  She buys calves from local sellers and keeps them for three months until they have grown enough to sell on to buyers.  \"I have operated the business for 8 years\", she says, \"and, happily, it's a success . . . I have used my earnings to better provide for my son\".  She built a pen for keeping and caring for the cattle, so she no longer has to keep them in the country as before.

Many of them make their living from the land as their ancestors have for centuries.  The beautiful landscapes, the colorful traditional houses and the many natural riches make our area special.  \r\n\r\nOur member, Do\u00f1a Juana, is a happy and enthusiastic woman.  She has worked hard to support her six children, two of whom are still in school.  She started a business raising sheep and poultry more than 20 years ago to help her husband, F\u00e9lix, with the family's expenses. \"I decided to start a business to help with expenses and our daughters' educations\", she says, \"and this business allowed me to earn an extra income and still be at home to care for my family\".  She keeps the animals for several months until they have grown enough to sell on.  The bigger and better-fed the animals are, the more she can sell them for.  She supports the local economy by buying the animals from local buyers.  She is grateful to VF Mexico, she says, because she has benefited from the loans she has received.  She is applying for a new loan that she will use to buy more animals and feed.  The investment will cover her expenses until the end of the year.  Do\u00f1a Juanita is confident in her plans for her business and expects to go on growing it.  She hopes to continue supporting her daughter who wants to be a doctor.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the group are Jos\u00e9, who will invest his share of the loan in his food business and Faustino, Delfina, Eulalia, Guillermo and Mar\u00eda del Carmen, who all have businesses raising and selling cattle.  \r\n\r\n* The photograph was taken at a kiosk in the town and Do\u00f1a Juanita is pictured wearing a gray skirt and purple sweater.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1997516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sheep and grass for her animal sales business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-10-27T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-26T18:30:03Z","loan_amount":5600,"lender_count":133,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faustino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eulalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delfina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guillermo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":92000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":5600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":13142.86},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":13142.86},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":13142.86},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":13142.86},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":13142.86},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":13142.86},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":13142.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-14T02:51:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":968819,"name":"Firma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Firma is a 60-year old  married woman  with eight children, two  attend school.

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking.

To bring income into the home, she has been raising animals for over three years, with good results and with her broad experience. <br \/>\"Although they eat more feed, they grow faster and therefore generate better earnings when the time comes to sell them,\" she observes, referring to cattle.<br \/><br \/>The specimens are purchased when they are very small, from people in her community. Then she cares for them until they reach an ideal weight. This process can take several months of attention. She currently has eight cows, and with the help of the loan she could buy 200 bundles of oats which would be used to feed all of her animals. \"I am truly grateful  to VF M\u00e9xico because they always help me to gather the needed amount to invest,\" she points out.<br \/><br \/>While at present she only has a small corral where her animals tend to get sick during rainy times, she intends to buy the supplies to build a space that better suits her needs. <br \/><br \/>\"What I most dream of is to continue to support my children in their studies so that they can complete university degrees,\" she says with enthusiasm .<br \/>     <br \/>The other members of the group are Francisca and Fernando who invest in sheep, Mar\u00eda who invests in chickens, and Teresa, in turkeys and embroidery.<br \/><br \/>*The photograph was taken on the steps of the municipal kiosk.

Thirty-three year old Arlene of Polomolok, South Cotabato finds it true. She and her husband, Joselito, run two enterprises: a variety store and wholesaling of soft drinks. As a soft drinks wholesaler, Arlene buys loads of soft drinks at wholesale prices and distributes these to sari-sari stores and other retailers. They have been doing this for almost five years and they are earning approximately PHP 23,000 a month. They toil hard to supply their family\u2019s daily needs and prepare for their young child\u2019s education. They also dream of renovating their house someday.<br \/><br \/>Just like other businesses they also experience certain difficulties such as malfunction of their delivery vehicle, long overdue debts, and lack of capital. If their delivery vehicle encounters mechanical problem, their customers have no choice but to order from another dealer. It greatly affects their income and everyday sustenance. <br \/><br \/>To cope up with these problems, she is requesting for PHP 50,000 additional capital for vehicle maintenance and truckloads of soft drinks to resell. Arlene aspires to build their own outlet or stock room someday. She hopes you can extend your heartfelt generosity to her so she can gradually reach her dream.

Mar\u00eda is a leader in the community of Peralta, and known as a hardworking person with excellent principles.  Her entrepreneurial spirit has led her to develop different productive jobs, such as catalog sales and the breeding of animals, that allow her to generate income and help her family.  In a rural community with a scarcity of jobs, Mar\u00eda engineers things to place her products and open new markets.<br \/><br \/>Currently the business she wants to strengthen is cattle raising, while she continues to work in aviculture, a business she has managed to consolidate, and occasionally in pig farming.  She is a person who has always maintained good payment practices with the 3 loans she previously sought.  She began her business seven years ago, with 100,000 colones.  Her assets of more than 4 million colones are concentrated in the land she uses for pig farming.  Her investment plan is to buy calves and all the supplies necessary for raising and breeding them, such as food, vitamins, and deworming medicines, among others.<br \/><br \/>Due to the rural nature and the particularities of the community she lives in, there is a market consisting of the economically active population: potential customers who cannot travel to other places to buy chickens, eggs, and soon, milk and beef, to whom she will be able to sell her products.   She herself delivers the orders she gets, including those made from other communities.  Mar\u00eda is certain that competition exists, nevertheless, she asserts that the care she gives the animals is the guarantee she can offer for her product.  She is accustomed to separating the organic waste to be converted into fertilizer, as some of the crops on her property are for the family's consumption."}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":2075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2005322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy calves and all the supplies necessary for raising and breeding them, such as food, vitamins, and deworming medicines, among others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Turrialba, Cartago.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2015-10-27T21:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-26T21:30:02Z","loan_amount":2075,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2016-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":1100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":32,"loan_amount":2075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":29303.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":29742.66},{"due_date":"2016-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30188.8},{"due_date":"2016-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":30641.63},{"due_date":"2016-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":31101.25},{"due_date":"2016-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":31567.77},{"due_date":"2016-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":32041.29},{"due_date":"2016-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":32521.91},{"due_date":"2016-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":33009.74},{"due_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":33504.88},{"due_date":"2016-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":34007.46},{"due_date":"2017-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":34517.57},{"due_date":"2017-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":35035.33},{"due_date":"2017-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":35560.86},{"due_date":"2017-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":36094.27},{"due_date":"2017-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":36635.69},{"due_date":"2017-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":37185.22},{"due_date":"2017-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":37743},{"due_date":"2017-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":38309.15},{"due_date":"2017-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":38883.78},{"due_date":"2017-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":39467.04},{"due_date":"2017-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":40059.05},{"due_date":"2017-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":40659.93},{"due_date":"2018-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":41269.83},{"due_date":"2018-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":41888.88},{"due_date":"2018-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":42517.21},{"due_date":"2018-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43154.97},{"due_date":"2018-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":43802.29},{"due_date":"2018-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":44459.33},{"due_date":"2018-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":45126.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.28},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.1},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.95},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.8},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.67},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.55},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.44},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.35},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.27},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.2},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.15},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.11},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.09},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.08},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.09},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.11},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.14},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.2},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.26},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.35},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.45},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.56},{"due_date":"2018-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.7},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.85},{"due_date":"2018-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.02},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.2},{"due_date":"2018-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.41},{"due_date":"2018-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.63},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.87},{"due_date":"2018-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-22T21:32:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Hiller","image":null}},{"id":969045,"name":"Miriam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Miriam is 38 years old.

She is a hardworking woman who wakes up very early to buy shellfish wholesale, as she has earned a living by selling fish and shellfish for many years. This has allowed her to get her family ahead. Mercedes lives in a house she has owned for various years. After losing her husband, Mercedes put all of her effort into getting her children ahead; they're already adults and have their own families.

She has a three year old child and has lived in a common-law relationship for five years. She is a youth with many plans and the desire to excel. She has been a businesswoman for four years and during this time has taken training in other productive activities such as painting ceramic pieces, manicure and pedicure techniques as well as business management. All this knowledge has allowed her to develop different fields, generating additional income for her household and achieving her financial independence.<br \/><br \/>Her main business is selling different products like clothing, lingerie, sandals, perfume and household items itinerantly. Also as a part time business she is painting ceramic pieces, a skill she has perfected in  various courses. This is where she is going to invest the loan buying raw ceramic pieces, paint, chalk, enamel, brushes and others. <br \/><br \/>As if this is not enough Yensy is starting to provide service to clients who want their nails painted, false nails and others, thanks to a course that is now finishing. The first loan she requested was as part of a communal bank and this is her second loan as an individual. The previous loans have been paid punctually. <br \/><br \/>Carrying out these different activities has allowed her to pay for her technical courses which now represent a source of income. The majority of the income that these enterprises generate is destined to be re-invested. <br \/><br \/>Her clients are neighbours of the same community where she lives as well as neighbouring villages. Her classmates in her courses also buy her products. She does her selling itinerantly as well as delivering ceramic pieces. Her manicure and pedicure services are out of her house. Thanks to her diverse activities she has regular income and though it is very high it represents an important support for her.

It dawned on her that she could extend her chicken business by adding layer chickens so that she can get eggs that she can sell daily around her neighbourhood.

Marichu, 49, from Fatima, General Santos City, South Cotabato runs a variety store that sells toiletries, repacked condiments, snack items, canned goods, eggs, and many other items. She finds extra income from load retailing or e-loading for cellphones. This business is very popular now in the Philippines, because most cellphone owners use a prepaid plan and only a few subscribe to a postpaid plan. In a prepaid arrangement, a person can budget his load usage because he can buy as little as a 10-peso load. It is indeed a good business to combine with a variety store. Basically Marichu\u2019s income helps provide for her family\u2019s daily needs. But her forward-looking mindset drives her to improve her business in order to save better for her children\u2019s education. <br \/><br \/>Marichu would like to obtain additional capital worth PHP 50,000 that she can use to buy more products for her store and a load wallet for cellphone e-loading. The earnings that she can derive from this will add up to the regular wage of her husband, Martin, a merchandiser. Furthermore, the couple plans to invest in a motorcycle for rent to increase the family's resources. They aim to continually provide for the needs of their family and the schooling of their two children in college and high school. Both of them want to see their children finish their college degrees and acquire stable jobs someday. <br \/><br \/>Marichu gains inspiration from her co-fellowship* members who meet every week to share stories of their lives and businesses and draw strength from the Word of God. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

In this region, a group was formed to request loans through VFMexico.  The members of this group decided to name themselves \"Honestidad\" [Honesty], since honesty is one of the core values for human beings.<br \/><br \/>Currently, the group is made up of: Francisca, who sells tacos and crafts; Irma, who sells cheese; Sofia, who sells cosmetics, meat, and tamales; Patricia, who sells cosmetics; Angelica, who sells desserts; and Sessy, who sells clothes and shoes.  <br \/><br \/>Irma is a woman committed to her family and their financial situation.  More than six years ago, she decided to use her time in something productive, which led her to the raising and selling of pigs.  However, in order to obtain better profits, she opted to sell cheese door-to-door.  She was motivated by her husband and son who decided to help directly with this occupation.  Today, the family is very happy because not only is this a means of obtaining income, but also a way to unite them in a special way.<br \/><br \/>Every day, from very early, they begin the process of making cheese.  Each product requires a different preparation, but all contain the same touch of love that made them.  It is worth mentioning that each cheese has a different estimated production time, and as a result organization is very important.  \"In addition to being a family business, we can provide employment to four young people who are in charge of distributing the merchandise by motorcycle in different communities,\" a satisfied Irma expressed.  The profits have enabled them to remodel their home, expand their work space, and finally, meet every one of their responsibilities.  <br \/><br \/>On the other hand, she is proud of the progress and the result of her dedication and that of her family.  They have been fortunate with the loans provided by VFMexico.

In one of the nearby towns, a group was formed which has the name of \"Caridad (Charity)\" since the members identify themselves with this quality because it is the virtue of loving others as you love yourself. <br \/><br \/>The members of Caridad are: Alejandra who sells cosmetics and shoes through a catalog, Cristina sells sheep and pigs, Amalia sells food, Karla sells cosmetics and cheese, Luz sells pigs and shoes, Mar\u00eda sells food and chicken, Susana sells cosmetics and craft shoes, Edith sells clothing and pigs, Isabel sells food, bread and sweets, and Mariana raises pigs. <br \/><br \/>Isabel is a very hard-working woman who, 20 years ago, formed a united family with her husband, Apolinar, and her three children who economically depend on them because they are still in school. Most people know her as \"Chabe\" and, with the firm intention of offering her children the best, she decided to continue with the job that she does alongside her mother: selling tamales, stuffed chilies, caramels, sesame, coconut, orange, lemon and other typical delicacies of the country. <br \/><br \/>\"My children are the most important thing. They are the source of inspiration for me to give my best day after day,\" she says happily. She attributes her success to the flavor that her foods get from the firewood, her prices which are below her competitors, and the attention she gives her customers who willingly come every day. The earnings that she has gotten during all her years of experience have allowed her to support her husband with the household expenses and to start new jobs. <br \/><br \/>The loan that she has asked for will be invested into buying corn, chiles, meat, oil, butter, firewood and bread, so that she gradually consolidates assets for her children. <br \/><br \/>*The photo was taken on Karla's patio.
