Marco's income helps to enable them to continue their education. When he was 15, he had to leave home and travel some distance away to find work on a rose plantation. In an attempt to save money, he moved back home 8 months ago and started producing bricks in a small mill. Marco needs the money to buy an earth mixing machine which will make the task of making bricks easier and will enable him to boost his sales. He will then be able to use this additional income to help his siblings continue their education so they do not have to leave home at such an early age."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2006086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Vulnerable

is an energetic and beautiful young 27 year old woman. Born in Nkuene, a rural village in Nkubu, she has lots of enthusiasm and is very resourceful. Since she was a little girl she has demonstrated her talents and knack for farming. Nkuene is a remote village in the Nkubu area of Kenya where people live in mud houses and in dismal conditions.<br \/><br \/>But within the remote village of Nkuene, Purity is working hard to pull herself out of the dismal conditions. Most small-holder farmers view Purity as a role model and a mentor because of the resilience that she has despite personal challenges, and her passion to support her two children as primary caregiver. Purity started farming in 2007 after the country suffered post-election violence. With the unstinting support of her husband, who dedicated his 1 acres, she has grown the business dramatically. She has acquired numerous income-generating assets, including farm machines. She keeps dairy cattle and grows subsistence and commercial crops, such as maize. She takes pride in being independent and being involved in a sector that feeds the population.<br \/><br \/>Purity is seeking a loan to buy farm implements such as modern farming tools and seeds. Her operations are growing consistently. With your funding, Purity will expand her farming through buying good quality seeds and using modern farming inputs. The additional income will enable her to repay the loan, buy food for her family, and pay fees for her two children who are in public school. She feels blessed to have the support of her husband, through all her undertakings."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2006805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

He is looking forward to being connected as it will allow him to save money. He is seeking a loan from Kiva lenders to cover the upfront cost of connection to the grid, which he will repay through his payments for electricity.\r\n\r\nAn electrical connection dramatically reduces the cost of lighting in towns such as Les Anglais while offering far superior light quality and more generally providing opportunities for people to dramatically improve their quality of life.

She learned how to make this dish because \"it's popular and there is a lot of demand,\" she comments.

It has been running for seven years. This business helps her to meet their living needs.<br \/><br \/>Yanti was thinking of selling more products at her kiosk, such as noodles, wheat, snacks, sugar, rice, etc., but she needs more money to do so.<br \/><br \/>When she and her group members were told about TLM group loan products, they were enthusiastic about the loan. They then formed the Mangga 3 Group and requested a loan of IDR 10,000,000 for their businesses.<br \/><br \/>Just like Yanti, the other members also want to invest their loan portions for their businesses.

This is Alex. He is the Director of Hillside High School, a mixed school in the Urban area of Bunamwaya in Kampala with 350 students. Hillside High School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining an Ultra filtration water treatment system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase an ultra filtration water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nHillside High School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Alex ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2008160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Wakiso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-10-28T16:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-27T16:10:05Z","loan_amount":1575,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hillside High School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5616800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":1575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1123360},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1123360},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1123360},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1123360},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1123360}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":315},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":315}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-28T22:14:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":966631,"name":"Alma Maribel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alma, de 24 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta bachillerato, es madre soltera y tiene un ni\u00f1o de 1 a\u00f1o de edad y viven en casa de su madre.\n\nAlma, aprendi\u00f3 a trabajar en la tierra desde que era muy joven, porque sus padres eran muy pobres y tenian que colaborar con los gastos y oficios del hogar, el lugar donde tiene sus cultivos est\u00e1 2 kil\u00f3metros aproximadamente de su vivienda y las labores las realiza por la ma\u00f1ana. \n\nAlma, necesita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar fertilizantes foliares y pesticidas para control de maleza; de esa forma obtendr\u00e1 mejor rendimiento en sus cosechas y mejorar\u00e1 sus condiciones econ\u00f3micas.\n\nAlma, sue\u00f1a con ver a su hijo convertido en un profesional y tambi\u00e9n sue\u00f1a con tener su casa propia y darle las mejores condiciones de vida a su hijo.","en":"Alma, is 24 years old and studied until secondary school.

Her husband has been providing transport facilities by driving a taxi for 17 years.  Her husband needs to make maintenance of his taxi because the current condition of his taxi is not good and it requires more maintenance charges on a daily basis. Due to insufficient financial means her husband is unable to do maintenance of his taxi.

From a very young age she had to work in farming.  She lives in a rural community far from the urban area of the province of Mizque.  She has three children, all of whom are dependent on her.  Her husband works with them, since it is a family business, and they don't have many resources to hire day laborers.  They work in the fields together, as their fields are small parcels.  For that reason they work with others from their community.  They grow a large variety of agricultural products, but the primary products they grow in the large parcels are onion, carrot and potato.<br \/><br \/>Lidia is a well loved and respected person in the community in which she lives.  This is due to her dedication to her children and her work, as she at times even has to work as a day laborer in agriculture to make a few additional pesos.

Ruth is married to a fellow farmer and has one child. Her family's main income source is milk from their dairy farm. However, they are involved in other agricultural activities such as growing bananas, vegetables, fruits and grains. <br \/><br \/>The biggest problem that farmers from Nkubu face is the huge deficit in access to agricultural inputs, meaning that farmer' yields and incomes are far below what they could be. Juhudi Kilimo partnered with Kiva to provide financial services to smallholders around Kenya.

His stations his stall in a populated area. <br \/><br \/>He hopes trusts out of your good heart you could lend him funds in the amount of Php 40,000 to pay for dozens of quail eggs, chicken eggs, duck eggs, flour, cooking oil to cook \"kwek-kwek\", \"tokneneng\",  kalamansi, mineral water and soft drinks to sell at his stall.
