Starting a fire releases smog and smoke, which, when inhaled in large quantities over a period of time, can lead to lung diseases, eye problems, and in the worst case, to death. In these circumstances, life for women like Matseliso has been very difficult. <br \/><br \/>Matseliso has requested a loan from Kiva lenders, in order to be able to purchase a clean cookstove. These provide her, and 13 other people from her village who are living in similar circumstances, the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families and that does not require a lot of fuel, which is hard to find in Lesotho, nor expensive paraffin and gas. This stove can be started with the use of very little, readily available biomass like dry twigs and dry cow dung that do not require lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the homes. <br \/><br \/>This stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery, which runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones, and a mini LED lamp. This is a life-improving package for these people. This stove saves them time to be with their families, saves energy, eliminates the element of toxic inhalation and house-burning, and has given them the freedom to have a better-lit home to see better in the evening while cooking, and enables children to do their homework. <br \/><br \/>For stove info, please check www.africancleanenergy.com."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":260.87,"image":{"id":2010459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to pay for the ACE cookstove, which will improve her life in terms of health, cost of fuel, and the time she spends collecting firewood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LS","country":"Lesotho","town":"Setleketseng, Roma","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-29.5 28.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":452,"posted_date":"2015-10-29T16:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-28T16:50:05Z","loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamathibeli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamonaheng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Taemane","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manthabiseng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamohlomi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maretselisitsoe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malebohang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maseisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mathakane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matseliso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mampela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Makatleho","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mampoho","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malerata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LSL","disbursal_amount":16100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3500},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2016-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1400},{"due_date":"2016-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":260.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.35},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.35},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.35},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.35},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.35},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.35},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.35},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.34},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":260.87,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T13:20:25Z","rounded_local_amount":3562.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752003919}],"funded_date":"2015-10-29T17:58:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":969696,"name":"Kabayan Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juanita is the featured borrower of the Kabayan group.

Her business is making pants for babies.  She's very entrepreneurial, dynamic, and patient.  She has her business in the zone of Sajama which is close to a road junction where she can find public transport to any place she needs.  <br \/>Maria is tanned, short, and wears traditional attire from the region with hat, blanket, and skirt.  Her native tongue is Aymara and speaks Spanish for business.  She shares her life with her husband who works as an aid in the inter-county transportation system.  Their children attend school.  They live in their own house made of adobe with running water, electricity, and sewage system.  <br \/>Her business is selling \"buzos\" for babies.  \"Buzos\" are pants made of wool that are used for babies because of their easy way of slipping them on and off.  <br \/>\"I started sowing for other people but I saw the demand and started my own business\", says Maria.  The advantage of her business is that she works from home and can take care of her children.

It\u2019s not like office work that starts at 8:00am and ends at 5:00pm. Canteen operators go to market early to buy necessary ingredients, endure the heat while cooking, and defy their throbbing body pain after every day of work. <br \/><br \/>Maria Fe, 50 years old, embarked on small canteen business commonly called in the Philippines as \u201ccarinderia\u201d as additional income-generating venture. Her husband, Alejandro, is a self-employed worker with irregular income that isn't sufficient for their family\u2019s daily needs. Maria Fe cooks various meal recipes and sells it in front of their house, so she can earn extra money while maintaining their household. She combined it with a variety store that sells canned goods, biscuits, candies, toiletries, charcoal, and others. Her regular customers are her neighbors, the local community, students and working people. Profit derived from her business helps a lot in their daily expenditures and children\u2019s education. <br \/><br \/>Now she\u2019s planning to cook more viands and meal choices to take advantage of the opening of the second semester for colleges. More students are expected to buy from her and it will boost her income. This is why she prays for PHP 50,000 additional capital that she will use to buy more ingredients for her canteen business plus additional supplies for her variety store. <br \/><br \/>Maria Fe aspires that someday her business will grow and her children will finish their schooling to get better chances to land stable jobs. She gives importance to harmonious relationship among her family members. She is an inspiration to her co-fellowship members at CCT who regularly meet every week to reflect of God\u2019s Words and share stories about life and their businesses. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":286.68,"image":{"id":2010597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy more ingredients for her canteen business plus additional supplies for her variety store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Fatima, General Santos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-10-29T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-28T21:10:03Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Fe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3333.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":286.68,"local_amount":13333.32,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:15:37Z","rounded_local_amount":13372.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045850}],"funded_date":"2015-10-29T21:14:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Juliet Nagle","image":null}},{"id":969789,"name":"Samina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Like many women it was financial constraints that played a potent factor in encouraging our client Samina to approach Kashf Foundation in search for a loan.

Customers buy repacked cooking oil good for one-time or one sachet of shampoo good for two showers. <br \/><br \/>Josephine, 39 years old, manages a retail store and an Internet cafe called Piso Net (a coin-operated Internet PC). She's very grateful for the previous loan of PHP 20,000 which was generously granted to her by CCT in partnership with Kiva.<br \/><br \/>She was able to buy sufficient stock for her store and added packed viands for sale. Your support also was extended to her niece for her school needs. Helping her niece and supporting her business somehow lessens her longing for her own child. <br \/><br \/>Josephine is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan to buy groceries and beverages, ingredients for different viands, and seed money for another unit of Piso Net. In due time, she aspires to put up another branch of Piso Net in a populous area.  <br \/><br \/>She shares her experiences and aspirations to her co-fellowship* members at CCT Credit Cooperative. They regularly meet every week to share stories about their life and businesses and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":81.27,"image":{"id":1932376,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy groceries and beverages, ingredients for different viands, and seed money for another unit of Piso Net","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Davao City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"7.073056 125.612778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-10-29T21:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-28T21:50:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":81.27,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2015-11-17T14:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":3790.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":752045851}],"funded_date":"2015-10-30T15:43:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":969818,"name":"Sopheak","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sopheak and wife (both in the picture, standing inside their house), farmers and also fishermen, live in Koh Tamov with three children.

With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Tasi\u00fa can store his maize and sell it in the future for up to 37% higher prices than the market price at harvest. <br \/><br \/>Tasi\u00fa is grateful to be part of the Babban Gona family and in the end hopes to use his increased earnings to ensure that all his children get a university education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1949964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to eliminate the pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest by purchasing food and clothing for his family.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-10-30T01:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-29T01:50:06Z","loan_amount":50,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tasi\u00fa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":8350.63,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":50,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":8350.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-30T04:58:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Craig Kaufman","image":null}},{"id":966491,"name":"Osoria","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"Nasceu Namaacha prov\u00edncia de Maputo tem 33 anos de idade, \u00e9 vi\u00fava m\u00e3e de 3 filhos que se encontram a estudar, responsabiliza-se pela sua irm\u00e3 que vive em sua casa.\nCome\u00e7ou a trabalhar com Hluvuku em 2013, este \u00e9 o seu 3\u00ba empr\u00e9stimo na Hluvuku com o qual pretende adquirir material de constru\u00e7\u00e3o como: areia, cimento, var\u00f5es e mais para terminar a sua obra de resid\u00eancia.\nFuturamente pretende iniciar um neg\u00f3cio de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de frangos para venda.

2007) are often neglected, even by the government and financial institutions but Juhudi Kilimo tries to get to these areas in order to offer its services and to lend a hand to those who do honest work and who want to change the image of their country. <br \/><br \/>One such person is Beatrice who has now been practicing mixed farming for the past 10 years and has managed to earn a decent income. Her primary source of income has been milk, tea, crops and some personal business she engages in to make ends meet. She passionately loves dairy farming, and when asked what is most enjoyable about dairy farming, she stated, \u201cfeeding my cows.\u201d She sells milk to her neighbors and to the local market, but the demand has been overwhelming, and she cannot meet it. <br \/><br \/>For this reason, she is seeking a loan to buy an extra dairy cow, which will assist in increasing her milk productivity. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. This extra production will immediately translate to more profit margins and increased income levels. Profits from selling milk will be used to repay the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. Beatrice is very visionary, and she intends in the near future to start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling it, and to start selling dairy products such as yogurt.  An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future.<br \/> <br \/>The various factors that have led to failure in previous situations have not prevented Beatrice from wanting to succeed and fulfill her goals.
