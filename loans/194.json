She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called pasals, are an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margains. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.

She is a devoted married lady working closely with her husband in their family wholesale shop. They have had the shop for 11 years. Harriet has so far taken 16 loans from her group, each payable in four months. She is so grateful that using the loans has helped her so much in stocking their shop with the desired products in large quantities. They get their products from Kenya, Kampala and some of them in Jinja where prices are low and this has helped to fetch them profits.

She formed a new group because she moved to the Samana region, and had to leave her old group behind. Within days of moving to Samana, she easily organized a group of five women to approach Esperanza for a loan. She has the ability to quickly convince these women of how Esperanza can change their lives because it allows them to borrow money to invest in their own businesses.\r\n\r\nAs I said earlier, Maricela is on her fourth loan from Esperanza, and has an excellent reputation for repayment and for growth in her business. Her group is lucky to have her as a role model for conducting themselves in a successful business manner. She has used her previous three loans to go from selling on a very small scale from inside her home to a business where she is able to go through several neighborhoods each week to sell her products.\r\n\r\nHer goals are to keep receiving loans from Esperanza in order to grow her business and to also recruit others in her neighborhood, so they can enjoy the benefits of investing in

Jay has been engaged in his business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Jay joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jay has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Jay is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will also be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Jay from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She is 34 years old, married, and has no children. She lives in her own house with three stepsons and one nephew, who are between 10 and 22 years old and go all to school. Besides her family, she supports her older brother and her mother-in-law by sending them some food. \r\n<p>\r\nShe has started to study 5 years ago because before that she didn\u2019t have conditions to do so. At this moment, she is enrolled at the 5th grade and she intends to continue her studies up to higher education.\r\n<p>\r\nShe never leaves Maputo. She has been owner of her business for 7 years. Her husband is carpenter. She learned how to do business from her husband when he worked with a businessman and she has more than 12 years of experience. Through her business, she is able to earn approximately 5,000.00 MZN per month, with which she helps with the household expenses and saves some money together with her friends by the traditional system (called Xitique). \r\n<p>\r\nShe learned about Hluvuku through her husband and has never requested a loan at other banks.

She sells modern clothing for women, men and children. With the income from her businesses, she is able to cover her educational costs. She is studying to be a dental hygienist. Actually, she is about to finish high school. Aura is requesting a loan that she will use to purchase additional inventory for her store. It is especially important at this time of year with year-end parties, graduations and holidays. \n\nAll the women in the Trust Bank look forward to their monthly meetings when they make payments on their much-needed loans and then participate in educational trainings. Friendship Bridge calls the combination of small loans and education \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d. A different subject is covered at each meeting and the women are very anxious to improve their personal and business lives. \n\nAura and her 6 friends in the Trust Bank appreciate the kindness of KIVA investors as they strive to empower themselves and eliminate poverty in their lives.

She is 36 years old, married and the mother of four children. She has been known as a vendor for 15 years. She specializes in selling ice, juices and ice-cream. She has made this choice because she always wanted to be able to support herself and because she always enjoys this activity. She is requesting a loan of 100,000 francs [about 225 USD]. The purpose of this loan is to purchase a refrigerator in place of her broken one, and to return to selling her goods. Her revenues go towards paying everyday expenses and helping her husband. \r\n\r\nMrs. Diagene is the beneficiary of a collaborative project between U-IMCEC and PDEF, the Program for Child Development and the Family (PDEF)Seydina Issa Laye. The goal of PDEF is to reduce poverty in the community and especially to protect children from impoverished families. \r\nThanks to this cooperation, parents of such families can obtain credit at more flexible conditions than ordinarily. Since the program was launched in December 2008, 120 parents have received financing, ranging in size from 50,000 to 150,000 francs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame Dieumbe  D. est parente  b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, soci\u00e9taire  de la caisse de l\u2019U-IMCEC Camberene depuis mars 2003.Elle est \u00e2g\u00e9e  de 36 ans  mari\u00e9e  et m\u00e8re  de 4 enfants.

Maize grows really well there, and the local adults work in farming. The younger people have moved to the big cities or overseas.\r\n\r\n42-year old Sra. Martha is married and has four children aged 20, 17, 11, and 8. Her eldest daughter helps her with the sales of the produce in the market. Her 17-year old son works as a bricklayer, and the younger two are students at the local school called Agust\u00edn C. Vintimilla. Her husband is a bricklayer, and they are in the process of building their own home.\r\n\r\nMartha has a stall in the market where she sells different sorts of fresh grains and vegetables. She\u2019s been doing this job since she was seven years old helping her mother. At the age of twenty one, she started her own stall where she works from 4 am buying produce and stays until 6pm on Mondays, Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays. On Thursday and Fridays she works in a cafe--she\u2019s been doing this for four years--from 8am to 6pm. She also raises chickens to sell in Cuenca market.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with the foundation. She was encouraged to join the community bank by one of her friends in the market. With the money she is going to buy carrots, tomatoes, onions, chard, cabbage, lettuce, and baby chicks. She will also buy vitamins and food for the chicks. In addition, Martha will buy Ardex roofing for her house. Her goal is to complete the construction of the house.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Cruz Q. lives in the big city of Cuenca with three of her five children. The oldest two are married and live independently. Her 23-year old son is a bricklayer and gives her some money towards the household expenses.  Her daughter helps her with the market stall, and her youngest son is a student at the Turi technical college. \r\n\r\nThe house she lives in is her own, and she put in a lot of effort to build it. Her husband travelled overseas twelve years ago in search of the American dream and economic stability for the whole family, but when he got there he forgot about his family. Mar\u00eda says she has a new partner with whom she is rebuilding her life.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda sells quesillo (soft cheese), cheese, and all kinds of grains in the market. She\u2019s been doing this job for 35 years. She began in the 12 de Abril market and now works in the Feria Libre market where she\u2019s been for 21 years. She works there every day without a day off from 6am to 6pm.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future. \r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":517327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Movie Tapes & DVDs","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more video tapes and CDs for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Coastal Region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":194494,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria Y. is from the village of Hasaan Lopez Jaena.

Besides his family he is also responsible for his brother that lives in his home. \r\nAntonio left Vilanculos with an uncle that lived in Namaacha, a village that borders Swaziland, to look for work. He worked for his uncle for 2 years earning only 150,00mt. This very reduced amount was not enough for much and, in 2002, Antonio decided to start his own business. Using money he had saved from his salary, he left his uncle home and rented a room where he still lives. Antonio has been in the retail business for 6 years, working between the hours of 7:00am and 9:50pm when students are dismissed from school. His best selling products are radios, cds and cell phone chargers. His monthly revenue is 2500,00mt and he is able to set aside 800,00mt from that. \r\nHis business has grown because it satisfies his clients' needs. This is the second loan Antonio requests from Hluvuku and the first through Kiva. The first one was in the amount of 5000,00mt and it was used to purchase home appliances that were sold at his establishment. The loan was repaid without any problems.

She is married and the mother of 4 kids. Currently all her kids are in school. She loves selling goods, the business through which she obtains her daily source of livelihood. She has been a food vendor for 5 years now, a business through which she makes income to support her family. She sells fante kenkey, which is one of the favorite foods enjoyed by many Ghanaians because it supplies carbohydrate components in diets. Fante kenkey is prepared from milled maize and is eaten with either stew or soup, and it can also be mashed for ice kenkey. <p>\r\n\r\nZenabu takes delivery of stock from farmers who provide her with direct supplies of maize. This enables her to avoid middlemen who buy from the farmers and resell to her at higher prices. With this loan, she wants to buy maize in bulk to serve her customers.

She has faced many obstacles and challenges along their way. Her husband died young due to severe sickness.\r\n\r\nBefore she became a member of PDP-LP she already had a small business. She is now requesting her second loan, a loan of PHP 5,000.00 to buy assorted grocery items such as vegetables and spices. She also sells banana cues (bananas dipped in brown sugar and deep fried). Her usual customers are students, strangers passing by, teachers, municipal employees, and many others because her business is located along the National Highway near a school. Her business is growing and the number of customers is increasing.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that the business will grow bigger and more stable in the future, so that she can sustain their living. Like other parents, she is working hard for her children. She dreams that all of them can complete college and be able to support themselves. She is grateful for Paglaum\u2019s presence in her community, for its programs and its services that help people realize the importance of savings, insurance, and social responsibility.

Together with his wife they organized their household around this activity and up until now it has provided them what they need for their family's expenses.  Sabino and his entire family work very hard at cultivating, fertilizing and caring for their fields until harvest time arrives.  Then their labor intensifies because they have to harvest the crop, package it into sacks, and transport it to the nearest city to sell it.  For the future, Sabino is planning to increase his production by planting other varieties of potatoes.  This is the first time he has taken a loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA.  He has heard that this effort is based on solidarity and he hopes to fulfill this principle in his communal bank.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

to cut his friend\u2019s hair for fun. To his surprise, it actually looked pretty good! He started doing haircuts for all his friends on a regular basis and when he went to college at Savannah ST. College, he cut hair on the side to make some money. \r\n\r\nWhen Avery had just a bit too much fun with his college fraternity, Avery\u2019s father convinced him to go into the military. In the military, Avery was the \u201cgo-to\u201d barber. He says, \u201cAfter doing 60 haircuts in a day, I really learned how to cut hair.\u201d When he finished his service in the military in 1988, it was difficult for Avery to find a job he was interested in. His friend convinced him to go to cosmetology school. Avery then obtained his cosmetology license, his barber\u2019s license and, with a scholarship from the school, an instructor\u2019s license. \r\n\r\nAvery and his sister then started a beauty salon that they managed together for 15 years. In 2004, Avery was ready to start his own salon, \"The Masters by Avery\". He had developed such a loyal clientele that some of his clients helped him start this new business financially. He bought two chairs, two mirrors, two lights, and picnic chairs to begin with. The last-minute medley of furniture  did not deter his clients from coming! Avery continued to add items month by month to have a  salon with more sophisticated amenities. He has over 125 clients, and three stylists rent work-stations in his salon. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Avery plans to replace two dryers, a basin (for washing hair), chairs, and buy a new television for the clients to enjoy. Avery says, \u201cThese upgrades will contribute to a more relaxing environment and help put the clients and the stylists more at ease, and even make the stylists more motivated to make the business thrive.\u201d\r\n\r\nAvery hopes to build his business\u2019 name into that of a prestigious salon that provides quality service in the Baton Rouge community.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4600,"image":{"id":632172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber

Dali is married and has a daughter, Khatuni, who is 38 years old. Khatuni is unmarried. \r\n\r\nThe income of Dali and Ruben\u2019s (husband) family comes from agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milk cows. They use the milk to produce traditional Georgian cheese and sell it on the local open market. In addition, they have a small pig-breeding farm with one pig and piglets. Piglets are sold to the wholesaler. Along with the above-mentioned activities, the family has a one-hectare vineyard.  Dali and Ruben produce wine and sell it to the wholesaler. \r\n\r\nDali requested a loan to build a new cattle-shed where she can have much more than two cows.

He makes a living by offering taxi services in the main streets of the city Juliaca in order to support himself economically.

Since then, he has put much effort into maximizing the benefits, working daily from 8:00 in the morning until dusk. Julio likes the dynamics of his job, having a cross section of people from different places and not conforming to a set routine. The difficulty is fighting the streets in poor condition, or those that are very dangerous at night. He is trying now to build a better future for himself. With the money that Julio is requesting, he will fix his taxi so that he can offer a better service to the public.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This hard-working woman makes a living in agriculture, the main economic activity in her area. She started planting all varieties of peas and potatoes 18 years ago and has cared for them diligently. She also dedicates herself to livestock, caring for four cows and giving them personal attention. \"I have a pregnant cow who very shortly will have a calf, so I'll have one more,\" she attests. With the acquisition of some sheep along with the milk from her cows, she can bring extra income to her household. She also has the support of her husband, who works at a mine in Talco and earns a good amount of money. But a little while ago he became sick after being exposed to some chemicals. Because of that, Sebastiana wishes to open a small general store of primary-need products so she can earn more income and provide for her husband and her family.

She is a single mother, but that hasn't stopped her from providing for her four children, whom she not only provided a place to live, but also educated from their youth with morals. This tough role of being mother and father to her children filled her with vitality because without that she would not have succeeded in her work, selling meals and breakfasts at the markets. When she began her work she sold sandwiches in the streets, but over time has come to selling food at the markets, thanks to working with her sister, with whom she joined forces and opened a booth at the local market. This work keeps her very busy, but happy, now that her dreams have been realized so that she can make her business better. Enriqueta plans to become independent and have her own business location so that she can increase her revenue and finish paying for her children's school.

Mutalib has been dedicated to the business of cattle ranching for the last 10 years. This business requires a lot of dedication for the fact that it demands a lot of effort to carry out the breeding. This is also true due to the fact that it requires the strict control of every one of the animals, while at the same time feeding and caring for those that are older. It is necessary to emphasize that through this business Mutalib is able to maintain his spouse and his 4 children. It is because of this he is soliciting a loan through IMON International. The credit will allow him to buy more animals, which he will raise and sell in the market. Mutalib has gained a reputation for responsibility with his financial obligations and for keeping his word. We are happy to have another opportunity to assist him with the operation of his business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Tajikistan:<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON International:<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Artemia is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offerings. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Artemia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":395964,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is 49 years old, married, and has 6 children. She lives in the hamlet of La Puerta in the Lepaguare community in Olancho.\r\nShe started out earning a living selling cosmetics, but now she sells second hand clothes for kids and bedding. She had the idea to start this business after seeing some of her neighbors selling clothes and doing well from it. So, she bought a bundle of clothes and got very good returns and also was able to keep some items for her own use. She does not have set work hours, but her customers can come and find her in her house and she also goes around the community making sales when she has finished the daily housework. One of the advantages of this work is that the income enables her to help her husband with the household expenses. One of the drawbacks is that, as she sells her goods in the street, she is exposed to all types of weather. \r\nShe will use this loan to buy three bundles of second-hand clothing and this will leave her business better supplied. The resulting income will enable her to keep supporting the daily needs of her family.

Canmoros, Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a General Store and a Rice Retailer business. Her husband Francisco, who is 66 years old, works as a Driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. \r\n\r\nThey have 3 children who are between 33 to 38 years old. Teresita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1992 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Teresita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 20,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,500, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to buy stocks for the general store and rice to sell so that she could continue to save up for future improvement of business.   Teresita C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF)  is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has been selling clothes for more than two years and offers her merchandise to acquaintances and relatives.  Luz offers her products on credit and is assured of full payment for the garments that she sells.  She also engages in farming and has land that her parents inherited.  This enables her family to generate extra income.  However, she enjoys managing her clothing business more because farming requires that one must wait some time before seeing any profit.  In addition, farming requires capital to invest in supplies for fertilizing the land.  Luz will continue in both business activities in hopes of improving her sales and her farm production.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  Being part of a Communal Bank has significant meaning to Luz because she has a group of people who have complete trust in her.
