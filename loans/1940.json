She has been involved in animal husbandry and farming for many years. Turdububu's farm contains 6 cows and 46 sheep. She grows potatoes on 1.32 hectares of land for sale and household consumption.

This coconut wine is very popular in the Philippines. It consists of pure sap, with no bark mixed in, and it is generally milky white in color or occasionally it will have no color at all.

For 9 years of operation, her perennial problem is the long time debts of her neighbors which disturb the stability of her business. Her kind consideration to them is not enough to maintain her store. This is why she fervently prays that these collectibles will lessen so she can roll her capital wisely. Even if she\u2019s single, she takes the initiative to support her siblings, nephews and nieces. <br \/><br \/>She applied for PHP 10,000 loan as additional capital for her business. She plans to add rice to her inventory, buy more grocery items and cases of beverages. She\u2019s hoping that this additional capital will keep her business running. Eventually, she aims to offer a car wash service as another income generating venture. <br \/><br \/>Leticia is a dutiful member of CCT Credit Cooperative and meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Sometimes, they ask her to leave them so they can look and observe in detail the characteristics of the products.  A while later, she returns to take orders, and she can order a specific shoe.  One of the other advantages is that she allows her customers to pay in installments with greater calm and security.

Her motherly love drives her to work hard to help her child grow up with excellent values and a good education. At age 23, she is a small-holder farmer in the Nandihills area of Kenya. Over the past ten years, she has bred dairy cows and sheep and has developed her farm. She has also planted and sold a variety of crops. Evaline says the secret to her success is thinking of farming as a way to make money, not just as a traditional way of life. Adopting new technologies and methods, plus crop diversification, record-keeping and good planning also help. <br \/><br \/>Evaline was unable to study to find a professional career because of the economic situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up and she has been practising farming successfully. Due to how much she likes her work, she has even nicknamed one of her cows, which makes her a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows. <br \/><br \/>With her dairy cow, Evaline is able to obtain between five and ten litres of milk a day and this helps her support her family. She also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor supplies. Thus, she is seeking a loan to buy high quality seeds, good fertilizer and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques; using high-quality seeds will assure her of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. <br \/><br \/>Evaline is a visionary and her goal for the season is to boost her crop production so she produces more crop output than the previous year. All this can be achieved through lenders\u2019 help and goodwill. She believes that through this loan, she will turn her family's life around and be able to give her child a solid education.

She is married to Angelito, a tricycle driver, and they have a child. Raising a family in a third world country is a challenge for the majority of the Filipinos but the couple does their best to provide for the education of their only child.<br \/><br \/>Nelia operates a tricycle which her husband drives. A tricycle is a motorcycle with a side car that carries around four passengers. It is a common means of transportation in the Philippines and serves as a kind of taxi for short distance travel. A proper and regular maintenance of her tricycle is necessary to ensure efficient and safe service. In view of this she is humbly seeking help with a loan of 10000 PHP to pay for the maintenance of her tricycle. This will allow good performance of her unit and thus a steady income for her family's personal and household needs. <br \/><br \/>Nelia aims to buy another tricycle unit to augment their income. Her precious dream is to see her child finish college. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. <br \/><br \/>* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from her religion, which she studies. <br \/><br \/>* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study religion, build social capital and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2012149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for more gift items to sell at her small gift shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-10-31T12:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-30T12:40:02Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-17T16:48:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":970711,"name":"Mitchell Kay","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mitchell is 29 years old, married, and has two children to provide for.  <br \/><br \/>She put up a retail store almost three years ago to work for a profit, and this business became their main source of living.
