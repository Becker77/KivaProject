Making happy them brought a lot of positive emotions and motivation to her and her peers that she started making a hand-made stuff. She understood that simple things can be done by her hand and what can be used by others for their pleasure.<br \/><br \/>Begimay was one of the best students at math at school, and maybe because of that she has chosen the BA Program. She is applying for a Kiva loan in order to help to her parents with the university tuition payment. She says that it is very expensive for them to pay by themselves and she is glad to have a chance to be a Kiva loan recipient."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2012232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for her higher education in Business Administration at the AUCA.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Bishkek","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":326,"posted_date":"2015-10-31T15:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-30T15:10:08Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Begimay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":69,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-10-31T18:49:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":970821,"name":"Asiya","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asiya is 32 years old, living with her spouse in the area of Lahore Pakistan. <br \/><br \/>Her husband is a fruit supplier in the vegetable\u2019s market in a nearby town, and has done do for many years.

Then Natia requested a loan from Credo to start a trading business. Her loan request was approved, in the framework of a joint initiative by Kiva and Credo. This startup loan program provides startup credit with soft conditions for the country's poor people, who do not have access to credit products, being regarded as \"high risk borrowers\" because of their low income.<br \/><br \/>With the received credit, Natia will purchase a stock of various clothing and start trading. This will give her a chance to earn income and become financially independent. With the startup program, she will be able to make savings and provide a better future for her children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2012578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a stock of clothing and start a trading business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Tbilisi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2015-10-31T18:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-30T18:30:06Z","loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Natia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":44.21},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":69.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":69.27},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":71.21},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":76.73},{"due_date":"2016-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75.36},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":79.09},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":79.69},{"due_date":"2016-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83.4},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":84.26},{"due_date":"2016-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":86.62},{"due_date":"2016-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":90.3},{"due_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":91.58},{"due_date":"2016-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":95.23},{"due_date":"2017-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":96.81},{"due_date":"2017-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":99.53},{"due_date":"2017-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":104.78},{"due_date":"2017-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":105.25},{"due_date":"2017-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":108.83},{"due_date":"2017-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":111.25},{"due_date":"2017-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":114.8},{"due_date":"2017-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":117.59},{"due_date":"2017-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":120.89},{"due_date":"2017-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":124.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.21},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.28},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.27},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.21},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.73},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.36},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.09},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.69},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.4},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.26},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.62},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.3},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.58},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.23},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.81},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.53},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.78},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.25},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.83},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.25},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.8},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.59},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.89},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-30T18:29:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":970467,"name":"Leon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leon is still living with one of his sons.

Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

She is married to Arnulfo, a driver, and has two children. She has worked as a jeepney operator for three years and her earnings help fund her family's daily sustenance. She felt encouraged when she learned about Kiva and its lenders supporting the livelihoods of people in developing countries.<br \/><br \/>In the Philippines, jeepneys were originally used by the American military during World War II. Jeepneys are often converted into transportation vehicles; a jeepney is made two meters longer and two long, upholstered seats are installed in its bed. Jeepneys have become the most common and cheapest form of public transportation. Ana's vehicle needs regular and proper maintenance to ensure efficient performance and a steady income. <br \/><br \/>For this reason, Ana is humbly requesting a 19,000 PHP loan to pay for the regular maintenance of her jeepney to avoid breakdown. She hopes for a positive response to her request. This will ensure she can maintain her regular earnings and support her family's personal and household needs. <br \/><br \/>Ana hopes to acquire a new jeepney and look for additional ways to earn income. She prays for abundance in their lives. Every week, she faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members* to share stories of her work and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God.<br \/><br \/> * All Center for Community Transformation (CCT) community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2014769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to pay for maintenance of her tricycle for public transportation, including oil changes, tune-ups, tires, fuel, and brakes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-10-31T19:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-30T19:40:02Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":791.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":791.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.71},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.7},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.7},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.7},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-18T12:31:42Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caty McKenna","image":1831459}},{"id":971279,"name":"Than","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loem is the mother of 4 children and she owns a small grocery shop.

He believes this decision will improve his energy supply, which will help him run his business and also save on utility fees."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2013124,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to pay for a home solar-energy system.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Chor Village, Pro Snoeb Commune, Rolea Pe Ear Dist","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":407,"posted_date":"2015-10-31T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-11-30T20:20:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bunly","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":645,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.88},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-04T12:09:15Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Greg Gibson","image":null}},{"id":971261,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth is a 48-year-old married woman with 4 children.

se puede transportar en veh\u00edculos particulares o bien, como la mayor\u00eda lo hace, en animales de carga como burros o caballos. Estas zonas est\u00e1n generalmente rodeadas de cerros y sembrad\u00edos de ma\u00edz o ca\u00f1a de az\u00facar ya que la actividad econ\u00f3mica principal es la agricultura.\n   En dicha comunidad se integr\u00f3 el grupo llamado Gonz\u00e1lez Comercio cuyos integrantes, como refiere el nombre, son comerciantes. Ellos son: Ma. Del Socorro quien vende abarrotes; Lucila, comida; Guadalupe, cosm\u00e9ticos y Adri\u00e1n quien maneja un taxi. Cabe mencionar que dicha comunidad cuenta con patrocinios de World Vision para que los ni\u00f1os tengan una mejor calidad de vida.\n    Don Adri\u00e1n es actualmente el \u00fanico var\u00f3n que integra el grupo y se siente muy contento de tener a su lado compa\u00f1eras trabajadoras y alegres. Durante 10 a\u00f1os brind\u00f3 servicio de chofer de un autob\u00fas con lo que gano mucha experiencia al volante; despu\u00e9s de cinco a\u00f1os cambi\u00f3 de unidad y ahora maneja un taxi. En gran medida su decisi\u00f3n tuvo que ver con el hecho de que anteriormente no ten\u00eda tiempo libre para estar con su familia integrada por su esposa Teresa y sus hijas.\n   Hoy en d\u00eda es considerado uno de los mejores taxistas de la zona pues trata amablemente y con mucho respeto a cada uno de sus clientes. \u201cHe dedicado varios a\u00f1os de mi vidas tras un volante; estoy satisfecho por tener mi propia unidad y por estar con mi familia\u201d expres\u00f3 alegremente. Una de las actividades que m\u00e1s le agradan es que se encarga de transportar los maestros que brindan educaci\u00f3n a los ni\u00f1os de la comunidad, por ello inicia desde muy temprano con el objetivo de cubrir las necesidades de los pasajeros.\n   En esta ocasi\u00f3n invertir\u00e1 el apoyo de VFM\u00e9xico en la compra de buj\u00edas, aceite, anticongelante, un gato hidr\u00e1ulico y 4 llantas nuevas para que su unidad est\u00e9 en \u00f3ptimas condiciones. El objetivo que tiene en mente es el de adquirir otro taxi el cual pueda rentar con alg\u00fan trabajador.\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en la tienda de abarrotes de Do\u00f1a Socorro, Adri\u00e1n es el \u00fanico var\u00f3n en la fotograf\u00eda.\n","en":"In the state of Oaxaca, there are rural areas in which a person can only get around in a private car, or as most people do, on pack animals such as donkeys or horses. These areas are usually surrounded by hills and fields of corn or sugar cane, because the primary economic activity is agriculture.\r\n\r\nIn this community is the group called Gonz\u00e1lez Comercio, whose members, as the name implies, work in commerce. They are Socorro who sells groceries; Lucila who sells food; Guadalupe who sells cosmetics; and Adri\u00e1n who is a taxi driver. It is worth mentioning that this community has sponsorships with World Vision, for the children to have a better quality of life. Adri\u00e1n is currently the only man in the group, and he is very happy to have hard-working and cheerful partners at his side.\r\n\r\nFor 10 years, he was a bus driver, which gave him a log of experience behind the wheel. Five years ago, he changed his vehicle and now drives a taxi. The primary reason he made this decision was because previously he did not have free time to spend with his family - his wife Teresa and daughters. Today, he is considered one of the best taxi drivers in the area. He is kind and very respectful to all of his customers.\r\n\r\n\"I have dedicated several years of my life as a driver. I am satisfied to have my own vehicle and to be with my family\", he said happily. One of the activities that he enjoys the most is that he is responsible for transporting the teachers who provide education to the children in the community. For this, he begins work very early to meet his passenger's needs.\r\n\r\nNow, he will invest Kiva Field Partner VFM\u00e9xico's help to buy spark plugs, oil, antifreeze, a hydraulic jack and 4 new tires to keep his vehicle in optimal condition. The goal that he has in mind is to acquire another taxi, which can be rented by a worker.\r\n\r\n* The photograph was taken in Socorro's grocery store.

So, for more than five years, she has remained in front of her sales stand because it brings new satisfaction every day.

It is admirable to see how she displays all her merchandise on the shelves that she and her husband built.<br \/>At this time, she wants to use the support to buy wholesale tomatoes, onions, peppers, and eggs. This will allow her to meet customer demand.  Her main goal is to expand her stand and integrate selling groceries and chicken to position herself as the best dealer in the area.
