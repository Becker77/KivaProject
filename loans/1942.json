He buys large quantities of plastic varieties and resells them. Though his income is not that drastic compare to other businesses, hard work and patience are his strengths to be able to run the business and support his family.<br \/><br \/>The business that he has right now is a job without day-offs where your hands get dirty just to make a profit. Like any other business goals, Nicolas wants to have his businesses expanded, and dreams to invest for his own car for personal and business use and continue to support his children\u2019s educational expenses and provide needs for his family. <br \/><br \/>Aside from hard work and patience, capital is one of the basis for business success to take place. That\u2019s why Nicolas decided to apply for a PHP 20,000 loan this year that will be used as added capital and a revolving fund as well. He\u2019ll buy a large quantity of scrap material, not just plastic but other varieties like metal, steel, cartons and glass.<br \/><br \/>Nicolas regularly meets with his co-fellowship members to share his life\u2019s testimony, experience on the business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and listen to the Word of God. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 members.

Having run this small venture from the premises of her home for the last four years, Anandini now wants to develop the operations into a proper business by purchasing an additional two cows. <br \/><br \/>Some of the challenges in the area include the lack of green fodder and quality veterinary services, but her biggest obstacle is the lack of personal funding to expand the business. She aims to add two more cows to her farm and seeks a loan of 36,000 INR along with her fellow group member from Kiva's partner Peoples Forum to make the transaction. <br \/><br \/>The investment will boost her profits and bring the farm a step closer to the business model Anandini envisions. Anandini is eagerly awaiting your kind help and support.<br \/><br \/>The lady standing to the right-hand side in the photograph is Anandini."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2011262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to develop the operations into a proper business by purchasing two additional cows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Patnagarh, Odisha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":241,"posted_date":"2015-11-01T17:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-01T17:00:11Z","loan_amount":575,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Prabhasini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anandini","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":36000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":36000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-22T09:07:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":971543,"name":"Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane is a single woman.

Open defecation is disastrous as it is impossible to keep human feces away from crops, wells, food, and children.

Most of the inhabitants are workers dedicated to jobs related to the ocean. \r\n\r\nThis is where Mrs. Mirella lives.  She is 35 years old, married and has 3 children, ages 17, 15, and 10.  All of her children study either at university, high school, or gradeschool.  Her husband is a fisherman.  \r\n\r\nMrs. Mirella is a woman who likes to earn her own income and use it to help her husband to move their household forward.  Her children's studies are of the utmost importance.  She makes a living selling all types of clothing, which she does through door-to-door sales.  She goes out four times a week in the morning, as it is the coolest, delivers on credit and collects each week.  She now has over 8 years of experience in this sector, which have been financed by the loans she has received, which is why she is very grateful to the institution and to the people who help her with the loans.    \r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy pants, blouses, shirts, and certain fishing materials that her husband needs.  She has been in the Credit Group since the beginning and she likes it because the loans allow her to finance her business.  Her dream is to give her children a better education.

She works in an agricultural area with the help of her husband. They grow products on their own land, which they got with a lot of effort during the settlement program, migrating from the places where there was little economic activity. Currently she produces one hectare of yucca, 3 hectares of palm hearts, and 1 hectare of citrus. They sell the products to intermediaries who come to purchase at the harvesting location. The production is by the family and they also hire occasional workers who help maintaining and harvesting the products. She has always kept an eye on the economic growth and the well-being of her children so that they go to school. She saw that the production of palm hearts generated good income for her and it was easy to manage, so she decided to expand the production. For this, she needs a loan to carry out the expansion of the production so that, in the medium term, her income will increase.

Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.
