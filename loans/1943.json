He is married, but without kids yet unfortunately, which is why he puts all his mind and soul into his work. Fathullo and his wife live in a small house in the countryside. To provide for his family, Fathullo is running his own business. He is a dekhan farmer breeding livestock. He owns a land lot which is partially dry land, partially irrigated land. On this land Fathullo cultivates carrots, potatoes, and crops. His wife helps him look after livestock. As their land lot is big enough, they also graze their livestock on it. This business generates a decent income, hence, Fathullo wants to expand it by increasing the livestock headcount. This is the reason he turned to Arvand for a loan to buy cattle.

behind her. She is 57 years old. She lives in the town of Kulob, the people of which are famous for their hospitality and sense of humor. Sobiramo's husband passed away and she was grieving for a long time, but her four-year-old grandson helped her cope with stress. She took up sewing again. She is confident that sewing is her vocation. Sobiramo decided to buy a sewing machine to take orders and hel her daughter provide for the family. Her daughter is a single mom providing for her mother and her son, working as a secondary school teacher.

She is responsible, hardworking, punctual, and persevering. She has secondary education, and she breeds livestock and cultivates crops as the main source of income for her family, having started 36 years ago with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Sarabyubyu's persistent hard work, currently her farm has five cows and two sheep. On a land plot of 0.74 hectares, she cultivates barley. Her monthly income is about 8,000 som (KGS), and these funds are not sufficient for an adequate life. \n\nThus, in order to make it possible to develop her business and increase her income, Sarabyubyu has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS) in order to buy three calves for fattening and resale. She plans to invest the funds from the loan in the further expansion of her business, and in paying for her son's

Kinza is hopeful that this loan will be a productive one for her husband and will bring positive changes to his business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2013336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Conflict Zones","Islamic Finance"],"use":"to buy a new engine for the van to provide better facilities to customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Abbottabad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":245,"posted_date":"2015-11-02T14:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-02T14:40:07Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kinza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2083},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2083},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2083},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2083},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2083},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2083},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083},{"due_date":"2016-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2083},{"due_date":"2016-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083},{"due_date":"2016-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":2083},{"due_date":"2016-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2087}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-10T14:31:17Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":972041,"name":"Phi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Phi  is 55 years old.

A certain amount will also be allotted to buy more supplies for her inventory. <br \/><br \/>Sarah aims to acquire another tricycle to improve their income, better provide for her family's needs and save enough for the future.

With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Aminu will store the maize he harvests and delay its sale until a later date in the season when he can obtain a significantly higher price for his maize at a premium up to 37% more than the harvest price. <br \/><br \/>With the opportunity to earn up to $2000\/Ha, Aminu now has the opportunity to actualize his dream to grow his agriculture business for himself and his family members and would like to use this additional income to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2014144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-02T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-02T17:50:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":44645.74,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":44645.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-01T18:01:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey","image":713929}},{"id":972182,"name":"Sjida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sjida is a 32-year-old married woman and a mother of two children.

They were very interested in the loan product. When other women agreed, Linda then formed the Sejahtera group and applied for a loan totaling 15,000,000 IDR. The other members would like to invest their parts for different businesses and other interests. They wish that the loan provided by Kiva through TLM will help them to have better lives."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2010072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to
