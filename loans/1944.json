With this loan and Babban Gona\u2019s support, Hajara will store the maize she harvests and delay it\u2019s sale until a later date in the season when her can obtain a significantly higher price for her maize at a premium up to 37% more than the harvest price. <br \/><br \/>With the opportunity to earn up to $2000\/Ha, Hajara now has the opportunity to actualize her dream to grow her agriculture business for herself and family members and would like to use this additional income to ensure that all her children get a university  education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1904254,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-03T06:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-03T06:20:03Z","loan_amount":50,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hajara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":6890.92,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":50,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":6890.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-03T06:42:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":972385,"name":"Khaled","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khaled is 22-year-old university student majoring in Geology.\u200e He has two siblings and his father is retired, so his pension in not enough to cover the household expense \u200eand also Khaled`s fees.\u200e<br \/><br \/>He needs finances to pay his tuition fees, so he would like to get a loan.

This is Shifa. She is the Director of Green Circles School, a mixed school in the urban area of Fort Portal with 900 students. Green Circles School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 1,000 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Green Circles School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Shifa ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve her student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2014691,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Fort Portal","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-11-03T13:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-03T13:20:03Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Green Circles School","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":5160000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1032000},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1032000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":295},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-03T23:23:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michael Angelilli","image":1331534}},{"id":972394,"name":"Saumu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saumu  is a married  woman  with five children all of whom attend school.

Hasadu ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students' concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children who fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2014709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-11-03T14:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-03T14:20:03Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"City Junior School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3581300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":716260},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":716260},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":716260},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":716260},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":716260}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":205}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-03T22:13:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marsha Berkowitz","image":402980}},{"id":969857,"name":"Maria Susana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Susana de 53 a\u00f1os de edad,  de estado civil divorciada, tiene 2 hijas vive con ellas y con sus nietos Brighith de 16 a\u00f1os, Francisco de 5 a\u00f1os, Hanny de 4 a\u00f1os estudian en unidades educativas gratuitas, hace 18 a\u00f1os empez\u00f3 a vender ropa en las calles hace dos a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s alquila un peque\u00f1o local donde vende pantalones jeans.

The proximity of the pig sty to his house makes it easy to supervise. The piglets are sold to butchers. <br \/><br \/>His sources of income are diverse. From 2000 to 2004, he held jobs such as mechanic and carpenter. From 2004 to 2008, he worked as a plumber. These activities remain a source of income to this day, but Michel focuses mainly on pig farming. <br \/><br \/>The family lives in a rented house. The goal is to expand the activity by increasing the number of animals to raise as the market is fairly reliable. This will enable the family to build their own home."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2008261,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a sow and some piglets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MG","country":"Madagascar","town":"Antananarivo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-20 47","type":"point"}},"partner_id":443,"posted_date":"2015-11-03T16:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-03T16:00:07Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Michel Romuald","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MGA","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5385},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":19615}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.93},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.92},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.92},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.92},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-03T17:17:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":972552,"name":"Rosie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosie is 42 years old, married and the mother of six children, all of whom are in school.

a positive and hard-working woman. She is married and has four children. She lives in a small rural village. Marhamat dreamed of becoming a school teacher since her childhood, but circumstances meant that she was unable to get a higher education due to her family's financial shortfalls. Marhamat was married immediately on graduating from secondary school and became a homemaker. But, even while being constantly at home, Marhamat never sits idle. She and her husband strive to do everything possible in order to provide their children with all necessities.\r\n\r\nMarhamat and her husband started their own business in order to have a regular income for food. They rear animals. Marhamat raises livestock, then she sells the milk and meat that she gets from them. Marhamat receives a good income from this business. Marhmamat's husband also works in a local workshop, and his work brings the family additional income.

She is not married and lives with her mother. Unfortunately, a long time ago, when she was little, her father passed away, and she was left alone with her mother. Despite the fact that things were very hard for her mother, she was able to raise such a beautiful daughter. Marhabo's mother was a seamstress and earned a living with this trade. Little Marhabo always helped her mother with everything, supported her and, after learning how to sew from her mother, decided to become a seamstress too. Now she is well established. She has a small sewing factory, and she is a famed seamstress in her town. She achieved it all with the help of her mother. Marhabo currently wants to purchase another sewing machine and needs money to do so. This is why she requested a loan from Arvand and thanks Arvand for the support in advance!!!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2000248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase another sewing machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Panjakent","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-11-03T23:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-03T23:20:04Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Fabrics"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marhabo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":119.23},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":123.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":131.37},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":126.73},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":146.41},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":145.7},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":150.86},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":153.77},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":161.64},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":161.2},{"due_date":"2016-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":174.94},{"due_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":179.27},{"due_date":"2016-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":182.72},{"due_date":"2016-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":193.32},{"due_date":"2017-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":197.93},{"due_date":"2017-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":205.17},{"due_date":"2017-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":214.26},{"due_date":"2017-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":231.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.88},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.8},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.07},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.18},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.07},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.89},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.35},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.59},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.52},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.7},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.38},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.93},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.61},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.34},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.49},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.92},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-22T14:09:37Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":972738,"name":"Savan's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Savan\u2019s Group lives in a rural village in Kandal province in Cambodia.

kindhearted and happy 33-year-old man. He is married, but unfortunately does not yet have children.  This is why he pours his soul into this work. Zoir lives with his wife in a small house in a village. He has his own business to support his family. He is involved in farming and animal husbandry. He has land, some of which is rainfed and some irrigated land. Zoir grows carrots, potatoes and cereal crops on this land. His wife helps him to take care of and raise livestock. Because their land plot is large, they also use for pasture for livestock.

Some people also buy water from refill stations, which is not always safe. Mrs. Ainun attended a meeting by Nazava's sales team about alternative household water-treatment options. There she learned about Nazava Water Filters. Nazava Water Filters filter well, rain, and city water so it becomes safe to drink without boiling, without using fuel or electricity.<br \/><br \/>Mrs. Ainun, who fulfills a leading function in her neighborhood, seized the opportunity and became the sales representative of Nazava in her area. This is the first time Mrs. Ainun has applied for a loan. She has an excellent record in repaying her loans.

is a positive and hardworking woman.  She is a widow and the mother of two children.  She lives in a small village in the countryside.  Since her childhood, she had always wanted to become a school teacher, but difficult financial circumstances within her family did not allow her to pursue a higher education.  Instead, she got married as soon a she finished secondary school and she became a home-maker.  In spite of the fact that she stays at home, Tursunjon is never idle; she always tries to do whatever she can to provide her children with all the necessities of life.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a stable source of income to feed her family, Tursunjon has started her own animal husbandry business.  She raises livestock and then resells meat and milk.  Thanks to this activity, she makes a decent income, which is enough for an average standard of living, but she doesn't have enough money to cover all of her family's needs.  At the moment, she wants to buy a few additional head of livestock for fattening.  For this reason, she has turned to Kiva's partner, MDO Arvand, and requested a loan to buy livestock.  She thanks Arvand in advance for their support, as it will improve her family's quality of

is a positive and hardworking woman. She is married and the mother of two children. She lives in a small village in the countryside. Since her childhood, she had always wanted to become a doctor, but difficult financial circumstances within her family did not allow her to pursue a higher education. Instead, she got married as soon a she finished secondary school and she became a home-maker. In spite of the fact that she stays at home, Mavluda is never idle; she and her husband always try to do whatever they can to provide their children with all the necessities of life.\r\n\r\nIn order to have a stable source of income to feed the family, Mavluda and her husband have started their own animal husbandry business. Mavluda raises livestock and then sells meat and milk. Thanks to this activity, she makes a decent income.  Her husband also works in a local workshop and his job brings an additional income home.  Their combined earnings are sufficient for an average standard of living, but they still don't have enough money to cover all their needs. At the moment, Mavluda and her husband want to buy a few additional head of livestock for fattening. For this reason, she has turned to Kiva's partner, MDO Arvand, and requested a loan to buy livestock. She thanks Arvand in advance for their support, as it will improve the family's quality of life.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2000188,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy some livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Shahriston","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-11-04T04:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-04T04:10:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mavluda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":452.52},{"due_date":"2016-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":477.52},{"due_date":"2016-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":488.49},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":505.6},{"due_date":"2016-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":524.53},{"due_date":"2016-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":551.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.61},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.34},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.05},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.05},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-22T14:00:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":972777,"name":"Sokny's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sokny\u2019s group lives in a rural village in Kandal province in Cambodia.

She is married and is the mother of two adolescent daughters who are students. She learned the trade of dressmaking from her sisters, who do this work. She acquired her experience working in manufacturing factories for more than five years. When these businesses closed, she also worked as a demonstrator for a personal care products business. After some years, and faced with the illness of one of her daughters, she felt obliged to stop working to spend more time with them. At the same time, she began to train herself in different areas, graduating from courses on medicinal plants and herbs in the INA, in addition to other courses in business management.<br \/><br \/>With this knowledge and the constant illnesses of one of her daughters, she began to make the first therapeutic compresses for exclusive use of her family. On confirming the positive effects, she decided to make the compresses to sell. Since then (one year ago), she has devoted herself to this business, in which she sees the possibility of generating additional income for the household and always looking after her daughters. The products that she has available for her customers are the therapeutic compresses based on herbal medicines and the therapeutic cushions that she herself makes.<br \/><br \/>Now all types of customers buy her therapeutic compresses from her, in addition to massage therapists, physiotherapists, and manicurists, since it is a complementary tool for this type of profession. Her products have much demand because of their curative properties, in addition to offering relief and comfort. At this time she sells in La Uni\u00f3n, in the center of Cartago, Turrialba, and some neighborhoods of San Jos\u00e9, and now she is making incursions into the fairs to show and sell her products.<br \/><br \/>Up to now there is no competition in the same community, and her products have had very good acceptance because of the positive benefits that they offer. With regard to setting the prices of the compresses, they are affordable, since the basic material used to make them is of low cost, such as the medicinal plants.<br \/><br \/>Do\u00f1a Margarita tries to give the best use to all the garbage. In the case of the organics, she uses them for compost in the little plantation for herbal medicines that she is beginning at her house. The recyclable material is turned over to businesses or nearby educational institutions. In addition, she makes boxes for packing the compresses with the wood scraps that a cabinet shop gives her."}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2010865,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural Medicines","sector":"Health","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy machinery and basic materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Cartago, La Uni\u00f3n, Tres R\u00edos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2015-11-04T04:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-04T04:40:07Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2016-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":25947.44},{"due_date":"2016-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":26336.65},{"due_date":"2016-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":26731.7},{"due_date":"2016-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":27132.68},{"due_date":"2016-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":27539.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":27952.76},{"due_date":"2016-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":28372.05},{"due_date":"2016-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":28797.63},{"due_date":"2016-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":29229.6},{"due_date":"2016-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":29668.04},{"due_date":"2016-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":30113.06},{"due_date":"2017-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":30564.76},{"due_date":"2017-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":31023.23},{"due_date":"2017-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":31488.58},{"due_date":"2017-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":31960.91},{"due_date":"2017-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":32440.32},{"due_date":"2017-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":32926.93},{"due_date":"2017-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33420.83},{"due_date":"2017-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33922.14},{"due_date":"2017-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":34431.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.73},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.78},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.58},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.38},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.2},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.02},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.86},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.72},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.58},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.46},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.35},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.26},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.18},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.11},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.06},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.02},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-22T16:15:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":968439,"name":"Miante","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Miante, 41 ans, est divorc\u00e9e.
