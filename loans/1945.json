He has been running two projects, a guest house and a barber shop. He has been in this business for seven years now. He works from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily and is able to make a good monthly profit.<br \/><br \/>This will be Mathew's fifth loan from Tujijenge Tanzania. He used the previous loans to buy new beds and start a barber shop and has been able to repay all of his loans successfully. He is happy with the loans. He used the profit to pay school fees, to repay his loan, and to take care of his family and cover household expenses. He will use this loan to renovate his guest reception area and to buy up-to-date salon products to meet his customers' needs.

She lives with her husband, aged 72, her three youngest children, and two youngest grandchildren. All seven of them live in a single-room traditional hut that is not well ventilated, nor warms up well in winter. <br \/><br \/>She and her children work long hours to ensure there is enough food for everyone on a daily basis, and only get help on Saturdays and Sundays in their fields from her grandchildren. She, together with the eldest of her children, wakes up very early, between 4:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., during the week to start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water, and warming the house for everyone, and their day begins. <br \/><br \/>Collecting firewood, setting up the fire, and doing the actual cooking demands a lot of her time. Temperatures in the Lesotho highlands are never really high; winters can get very cold, and often Maseeng has to start the fire inside her hut. Starting a fire releases smog and smoke, which, when inhaled in large quantities over a period of time, can lead to lung diseases, eye problems, and in the worst case, to death. In these circumstances, life for women like Maseeng has been very difficult. <br \/><br \/>Maseeng has requested a loan from Kiva lenders, in order to be able to purchase a clean cookstove. These provide her, and eight other people from her village who are living in similar circumstances, the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families and that does not require a lot of fuel, which is hard to find in Lesotho, nor expensive paraffin and gas. This stove can be started with the use of very little, readily available biomass like dry twigs and dry cow dung that do not require lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the homes. <br \/><br \/>This stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery, which runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones, and a mini LED lamp. This is a life-improving package for these people. This stove saves them time to be with their families, saves energy, eliminates the elements of toxic inhalation and house-burning, and has given them the freedom to have a better-lit home to see better in the evening while cooking, and enables children to do their homework. <br \/><br \/>For stove info, please check

This is Jennifer. She is the Director of Erina Bright Primary School, a mixed school in the Urban area of Makindye in Kampala with 480 students. Erina Bright School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nErina School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Jennifer ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve her student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2015454,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-11-04T20:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-04T20:30:09Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erina Bright School","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3817300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":22,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":763460},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":763460},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":763460},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":763460},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":763460}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-05T07:20:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":973076,"name":"Suzanne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Suzanne opened her cosmetics salon from her home originally.

Sekai knows this and uses it to her advantage. She also targets all the hospital personnel, from the midwives and nurses to the general hands. Her menu mainly consists of sadza (cooked cornmeal) and beef, rice and chicken, chips with chicken, fish or Russian sausages. <br \/><br \/>Sekai is in a group of \u201cgolden oldies \u201ccalled Evidence. They attended Thrive trainings and had a lot of revelations that inspired them to be better businesswomen. The other women in the group have businesses that include market gardening, selling baby wear at the clinic and keeping layer chickens for eggs.

He is 30, married, and the father of two children.  He contacted Kiva's partner, MDO Arvand, as soon as he heard about the possibility of receiving some financial support.  Foziljon and his family live in the countryside.  Because of his family's difficult financial circumstances, he never got the opportunity to go to university and get a higher education.  His wife did not get an education either; she is now a homemaker who takes care of the household chores and the children.\r\n\r\nFoziljon has his own business, which allows him to feed his family.  He fattens and resells cattle for a living.  In addition to this activity, he also works as a handyman.  Thanks to his work, he makes a decent income.  His wife also helps him with the farming business and sells the milk they get from their cows.\r\n\r\nFoziljon now wants to increase his cattle headcount and expand his business.  For this reason, he has turned to MDO Arvand and requested a loan to buy cattle.  He truly looks forward to a positive outcome and he thanks Arvand in advance for their support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2007715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy some cattle.
