All her children go to school during weekdays. She lives with her unemployed husband who works in their fields to produce food and care for their livestock. The only means of income is by selling livestock and crops.<br \/><br \/>Keletso lives in a traditional hut that is not well ventilated and does not warm up well in winter. She works long hours to ensure there is enough food for the family on a daily basis, and only gets help on Saturdays and Sundays from her children. She has to wake up very early, between 4:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., during the week to start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water, and warming the house for herself, and her day begins. <br \/><br \/>Collecting firewood, setting up the fire, and doing the actual cooking demands a lot of her time. Temperatures in the Lesotho highlands are never really high; winters can get very cold, and often Keletso has to start the fire inside her hut. Starting a fire releases smog and smoke, which, when inhaled in large quantities over a period of time, can lead to lung diseases, eye problems, and in the worst case, to death. In these circumstances, life for women like Keletso has been very difficult. <br \/><br \/>Keletso has requested a loan from Kiva lenders, in order to be able to purchase a clean cookstove. These will provide her, and seven other people from her village who are living in similar circumstances, the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families and that does not require a lot of fuel, which is hard to find in Lesotho, nor expensive paraffin and gas. This stove can be started with the use of very little, readily available biomass like dry twigs and dry cow dung that do not require lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the homes. <br \/><br \/>This stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery, which runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones, and a mini LED lamp. This is a life-improving package for these people. This stove saves them time to be with their families, saves energy, eliminates the element of toxic inhalation and house-burning, and has given them the freedom to have a better-lit home to see better in the evening while cooking, and enables children to do their homework. <br \/><br \/>For stove info, please check www.africancleanenergy.com."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2015593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Energy","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to pay for the ACE cookstove, which will improve her life in terms of health, cost of fuel, and the time she spends collecting firewood.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LS","country":"Lesotho","town":"Bela Bela,Leribe","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-29.5 28.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":452,"posted_date":"2015-11-05T08:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-05T08:40:02Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Keletso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Malikomiki","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mathulo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamotebang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Makhotso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mampolokeng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mapikoko","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mampakathe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"LSL","disbursal_amount":9200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2016-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2016-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2016-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.74},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.7},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.7},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.7},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.7},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.7},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.69},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.69},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.69},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-05T10:01:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":970519,"name":"Sabi Jooksi","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sabi de 37 a\u00f1os de edad, estudi\u00f3 hasta bachillerato, no sigui\u00f3 la universidad ya que sus recursos econ\u00f3micos no le alcanzaban para seguir,  se acompa\u00f1\u00f3 y su esposo actualmente se dedica a la agricultura, en su casa viven su suegra y dos cu\u00f1adas, ya que su \u00fanica hija se acompa\u00f1\u00f3 y vive aparte.\n\nSabi desde los 4 a\u00f1os se dedica a la venta de tamales y mariscos pues acompa\u00f1aba a su madre desde muy peque\u00f1a y fue as\u00ed como aprendi\u00f3 este oficio, ella antes trabaj\u00f3 como dom\u00e9stica en una casa pero lo que ganaba no le alcanzaba, despu\u00e9s pensaron con su esposo dedicarse a la compra de camar\u00f3n y comenzaron a venderlo en su cant\u00f3n, ellos compran el producto en su cant\u00f3n vecino que est\u00e1 a 5km de su hogar, para llegar hasta all\u00e1 lo hacen en un pick up, luego lo van a vender casa por casa y trabajan de 5:00 AM a 3:00 PM.\n\nElla solicita este cr\u00e9dito para comprar camarones, pescados y punches para surtir el negocio y tener m\u00e1s ganancias.\n\nElla sue\u00f1a con tener una mejor casa y comprar una vaca para vender leche y sus derivados.\n","en":"Sabi is 37-years old.

Anticipating of a good harvest this season, Bala has the opportunity to attain yields of up to 8 metric tonnes of maize per hectare of land, 5.5 times that of the average Nigerian maize farmer. Before joining Babban Gona, Bala would have had to sell his maize at harvest, a period when maize prices are at their lowest in the market, to meet his immediate cash needs.

Before joining Babban Gona, Hamisu would have had to sell his maize at harvest, when the price of maize is at its lowest, to meet his immediate cash needs. Hamisu will use this loan to store the maize he harvests, enabling him to delay its sale until a later period in the season when he can obtain the best price for his maize at a premium of up to 37% higher than the market price. Thanks to the support from Babban Gona\u2019s marketing services, Hamisu no longer feels the pressure to sell his maize at low harvest prices. With the opportunity to earn up to $2000\/Ha, Hamisu hopes to realize better yields and plans on using his additional income to provide employment to members of his community through his farm."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2016065,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-05T15:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-05T15:50:05Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hamisu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":23471.41,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":23471.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-18T16:10:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Steven Soltesz","image":null}},{"id":973370,"name":"Yusra","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yusra, 32, lives with her parents.

He uses a Mercedes Sprinter minibus to drive people around the city, but at this time renting the vehicle swallows all of his profit. His children help support the family, but as the head of the household he needs to earn money and feed his family. He also wouldn't want to sit at home unemployed.

He regrets not having studied beyond the second grade, which is why he wants to do everything possible so that his children have a complete education. <br \/><br \/>He has appealed for a sanitation loan from Kiva along with MiCr\u00e9dito. With it he plans to build a bathroom in his home. They still use a latrine and it's becoming a health risk for him and family.

She is a single mother with two children (19 and 12 years old).  The oldest is a university student while the youngest is currently in 7th grade in a private school.\r\n\r\nVololonirina used to work for a free zone company.  She has now been selling second-hand clothes since 2010.  It takes experience to develop such a business:  Vololonirina had to familiarize herself with her customers' needs, she had to learn how to select the right merchandise, diversify her goods (depending on the current fashion...).

These ladies believe in the motto: \u201cDo not think that someone else is more blessed than you are. It\u2019s just that we are blessed in different ways.\u201d It is with this realization that these women are grateful for the little businesses they are doing, and are willing to work hard to make themselves more successful.\r\n \r\nIn this group we have Idah, who is in her early 60s. Idah is a very dedicated business woman who has been the center of motivation to all her group members despite her age. Idah, far left in the photo, started a business in 1993 as a cross-border trader, but she changed the business due to the double tragedy of losing her husband in early 2000s and her daughter. \r\n\r\nShe was left to be her family\u2019s breadwinner and guardian to the children left behind by her late daughter. Despite these unfortunate events, Idah was looking for the blessing in every situation; she could not give up. As she progressed in age, Idah could not keep up with the cross-border trading, instead, she began going to different places, selling and doing barter trade.

Maideyi, the group\u2019s chairperson, notes that their friendship has indeed been a pillar of strength for her.  <br \/><br \/>Maideyi is a cross-border trader and she started her business in 2013. She goes to South Africa and sometimes to Zambia. Back then, however, Maideyi was not a consistent business woman.

Suddenly she was all alone with 3 children to fend for. <br \/><br \/>Maideyi is grateful to her group members who helped her to pick herself up. She resumed crossing the border to South Africa more frequently. She also opened a small flea market stall to sell her products, so she is steadily growing. She sells jewellery, cosmetics, household accessories and other small items. These are low margin products meaning that her profits are small unless she moves volumes. <br \/><br \/>Maideyi started facing problems when she was unable to restock as much as she wanted due to lack of capital. This is because her low profits mean, over time, she drains her capital when she makes withdrawals. This is when her friends invited her to join Thrive to receive business and financial literacy training. <br \/><br \/>Maideyi had this to say about her fellow members, \u201cJust one great partnership with the right person can have an incredible impact on your business success.\u201d <br \/> <br \/>Maideyi wants to take a loan from Thrive to increase the range of household products she has for sale.
