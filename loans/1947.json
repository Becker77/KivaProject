Members of the clan are well known for working hard and are highly respected. The Chihera group consists of three members of the same totem (zvihera) which can be translated as \u201cthe sacred\u201d. Jesca, a hardworking widow, aged 41 is a cross border trader restocking from South Africa and supplying small shops in Zimbabwe since 2009. Before, she used to be a dressmaker selling her products in Mozambique then Lesotho. Business was flourishing, crossing the border five or six times a month.<br \/><br \/>After prosperous adventures she managed to make good profits which she then used to put a dura-wall at her homestead and re-furnish her home. A better life is what we all wish for; and she has been working extra hard to provide for her family. She managed to send her children to boarding schools and her siblings too and bought a car. However, due to the economic hardships that have bedevilled Zimbabwe, 2013 began to be yet another turning point in her life as many people flooded into the informal business sector giving her stiff competition. Jesca broadened her products ranging from tracksuits, traveling bags, satchels and kitchenware and other goods that were market dominant during the time.<br \/><br \/>Her business continued to decline, as she said, \u201cmy husband fell ill, could not do any work and I was the only one working for the family. This also hindered my business operations as I had to take good care of him simultaneously and pay his medical bills\u201d. <br \/><br \/>However, this did not stop Jesca, strong like the Eland even with all these hardships she is still in business. She is now operating with less capital. She needs $500 to inject into her business so that it gets vibrant. \u201cGore rino tichadzidza zvakawanda\u201d (meaning 2015 is a year of learning) sums up her thanks to Thrive\u2019s trainings which have taught her how to keep financial records and plan effectively.

Without a vision a person flounders aimlessly. Rebecca likens it to Proverbs 29:18 \u201cWhere there is no vision, the people perish\u201d. Her vision has been her inspiration to achieve great heights and to be the best flock mother she can be as a pastor\u2019s wife. She has to juggle these two contradicting yet important areas of her life. On one hand she has to be available for the church where she aids her husband in prayer meetings, couples counselling and home visits to the sick etc. On the other hand she has to see that she keeps her business running so that as a family they have enough income to sustain them.\n\nRebecca, 39, registered with a local cellular phone company and set up her money transfer business in a busy Harare suburb and started earning commission from the transactions. She employed someone to be permanently based in that business while she crosses the border to buy African java print material and jewellery for resale from neighbouring Zambia. She then sells the jewellery, hair products and cosmetics at a flea market stall in in a local market.   She also sells to individuals working from various companies in town and has established a good client base for herself where her regular clients introduce her to new ones.\n\nRebecca is always counting her blessings and believes it is the grace of the Lord that has taken her and her fellow group members this far, hence the name \u201c\u00cfn his grace\u201d. The group joined Thrive as four young, zealous mothers who want to grow their businesses. Rebecca used her previous loan to cross to Zambia to restock the African print material which is highly demanded.

Despite the many fears and dire warnings, this new unique year brought a positive change to the life of one woman. She decided to put aside being just a mother and wife and added businesswoman to her title. In that year Fatima started selling clothing, shoes and bedding by her gate side as an income generating venture. <br \/><br \/>Fatima is 47 years old and customarily married. She is a biological mother to three children and \u201cmother to her niece who resides with them\u201d. School fees and other expenses are met by Fatima as her husband is only occasionally employed. Fatima uses her good taste in selecting colourful, eye catching beautiful clothing and bedding for resale to residents in her neighbourhood. <br \/><br \/>In the year 2012 Fatima decided to buy locally and go to Mozambique herself. This she saw as a cost cutting measure and at this stage she no longer had very young children so she could leave for days. She saved USD 300 and used it to go restocking in Mozambique, taking with her seat covers, sheets and different grocery items for resale in Mozambique. This benefitted her immensely as from the 300 USD she invested she made sales of 700 USD. This inspired her to cross more often and she established a good client base for herself. After her stay in Mozambique selling wares, she comes back to Zimbabwe with clothing, curtains, shoes and bedding for resale back home.<br \/><br \/>Fatima and four other women make up the group Mixed Fortunes and they all reside in a big high density suburb in Harare. With her Kiva loan Fatima is planning to buy bulk groceries for resale and also restock dried organic African food like mopane worms, pumpkin leaves, sugar beans and peanut butter for resale. These goods are in demand as they are healthy and taste good to the African palate. She also wants to stock up on beautiful, colourful cool summer sheets that are very welcome in Mozambique as they experience high temperatures."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2016861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy bulk groceries for resale and also restock dried organic African food like mopane worms, pumpkin leaves, sugar beans and peanut butter for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-11-06T21:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-06T21:50:02Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simbiso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1850,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":308.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":308.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":308.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":308.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":308.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":308.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":308.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":308.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":308.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":308.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-22T00:52:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":973924,"name":"Haleema","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Haleema is age 32 and lives with her family in the area of Lahore, Pakistan.

Yusuf is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to provide employment to members of his community through his farm."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1904635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, thereby eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-06T22:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-06T22:50:11Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yusuf","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":14952.11,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":14952.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-17T19:17:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":973766,"name":"Hei's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hei\u2019s group live in a rural village in Kompong Thom province in Cambodia.

With the opportunity to earn up to $2,000 per hectare of land, Markus hopes to realize better yields and plans on using his additional income to provide employment to members of his community through his farm."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1903723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-06T23:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-06T23:10:05Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Markus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":18690.14,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":18690.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-10T15:10:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":974016,"name":"Sakeena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sakeena is a 61-year-old married woman, living in the area of Multan, Pakistan.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.
