A mere housewife had to take the reins and lead her family into an uncertain future and bring back light to the otherwise darkened world of her children.  She became the mother and father to these young souls who were now entirely dependent on her for their upkeep.<br \/><br \/>Since she had a passport, the determined young widow decided to try her hand at cross border trading, crossing to Zambia and Mozambique to buy clothing and materials for resale. The business gave her money for rent, school fees, food and clothing for her children but it did not give her peace of mind. Her friend had a good chicken business and decided to mentor Priscilla and teach her all that she knew about the chicken business. Her altruistic actions did not stop there, she went further and let Priscilla use one of her fowl runs and start a broiler business. <br \/><br \/>Priscilla quickly mastered the art and started with a small batch of 50 chickens. These sold well, the business grew and she grew her batch to 100 chickens at a time. This business was what Priscilla needed.  It allowed her to be by her children\u2019s side guiding and shaping them into young responsible adults. The business also gave her the chance to provide a decent education for her children.

With Babban Gona\u2019s support, Micheal will store the maize he harvests and delay its sale until a date later in the season, when he can obtain a significantly higher price for his maize at a premium up to 37% more than the harvest price. <br \/><br \/>With the opportunity to earn up to $2,000 per hectare of land, Micheal now has the opportunity to actualize his dream to grow his agriculture business for himself and his family members, and would like to use this additional income to ensure that all his children get a post-secondary education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1874491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating the pressure to sell his maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-07T18:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-07T18:10:03Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Micheal Talle","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":29251.2,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":29251.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-23T22:55:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":974357,"name":"Eufemia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eufemia has been operating her retail store for almost 20 years.

It is for this reason that Mario is applying for a loan to buy basic materials and work tools that will allow him to achieve what he wants.<br \/><br \/>The loan will be of great help for Mario, since being able to buy what he needs for his business will allow him to improve his earnings and put him on the road to completing his goals, which are to expand his workshop and to give the best education he can to his son."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2013517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy basic materials and work tools.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2015-11-08T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-08T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mario Alberto \t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-13T21:28:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":974462,"name":"Dinisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dinisa is 27 years old and a very hard working entrepreneur.\n\nDinisa has a pig fattening business in the Philippines.

She hopes this is going to help the school move forward and be as productive as it can and make a real difference in her community."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2017047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to construct a few more rooms and to buy basic school supplies such as furniture for her school","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Chunian","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":245,"posted_date":"2015-11-08T14:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-08T14:40:04Z","loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yasira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":180000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":7556},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":7797},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":8046},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":8303},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":8568},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":8841},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":9123},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":9414},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":9715},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10025},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10345},{"due_date":"2016-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":10675},{"due_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":11015},{"due_date":"2016-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":11367},{"due_date":"2017-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":11730},{"due_date":"2017-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":12104},{"due_date":"2017-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":12490},{"due_date":"2017-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":12886}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.41},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.72},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.11},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.57},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.11},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.73},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.43},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.22},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.1},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.07},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.14},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.3},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.56},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.93},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.41},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.7},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-08T19:03:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":974177,"name":"St. Agnes Girls School","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Uganda!

St. Agnes Girls School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nSt. Agnes Girls School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Abert ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2017237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Bushenyi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.416667 30.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-11-08T14:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-08T14:40:04Z","loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"St. Agnes Girls School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3817300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":33,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":477162},{"due_date":"2018-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":477166}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.63},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.63},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.63},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.62},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.62},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.62},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.62},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-09T06:07:04Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":974549,"name":"Thao","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thao is 44 years old.

The rented house is made from mud and roofed with asbestos, which creates a very critical situation during rainy season. The most important thing is the house is not completely secure and safe. <br \/><br \/>In this situation, she decided to construct a small house with all possible facilites. She has already started to construct the house. But she lacks sufficient funds to complete it. So she decided to borrow loan from any bank or other financial institution.<br \/><br \/>At that moment, Jami came to Mahashakti Foundation to learn about house loan details.

The rented house is made of mud and roofed with asbestos, which creates very critical situation during rainy season.  It is also difficult during winter. The most important thing is the house is not completely secure and safe.<br \/><br \/>In this situation, Saraswati decided to construct an RCC (reinforced concrete) house. She has already started to construct the house. But she lacks the funds to complete it. So she decided to borrow a loan from any bank or other financial institution.<br \/><br \/>At that moment Saraswati came to Mahashakti Foundation to learn about house loan details. Mahashakti Foundation has decided to disburse a loan for house construction. From the loan Saraswati will complete the door, windows, plastering, flooring and painting of the house.

There are household needs and personal care products. She has few stocks because her usual practice is to show brochures to customers and get their orders. She will then advance the amount (either full or partial) to buy those pre-ordered products and give her customers one-month-to-pay credit. Therefore if she aims to increase her profit, she has to get more orders, and she has to advance considerable amount of capital. If she has higher capital, she can also stock up more items that she can readily sell.\n\nBecause it\u2019s Christmas season, she knows that she can get volume orders from customers. She is in need of PHP 20,000 additional capital to procure their orders. The anticipated increase in her profit will be very helpful in sustaining her family\u2019s everyday needs and school expenses of her daughter in college. It will also contribute in the happy celebration of Christmas for her whole family. \n\nDelma is married to Hermando, a draftsman, and their child is now in college.

With the opportunity to earn up to $2000 per Hectare of land, Idris hopes to realize better yields and plans on using his additional income to provide employment to members of his community through his farm."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1961016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-08T15:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-08T15:50:06Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Idris","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":21938.4,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":21938.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-08T19:19:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":974578,"name":"Mukhtaran","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mukhtaran is 46 years old and an active borrower of BRAC Pakistan.

Anticipating a good harvest this season, Najiyu has the opportunity to attain yields of up to 8 metric tonnes of maize per hectare of land, 5.5 times that of the average Nigerian maize farmer. <br \/><br \/>Before joining Babban Gona, Najiyu would have had to sell his maize at harvest, a period when maize prices are at their lowest in the market, to meet his immediate cash needs such as food and clothing. Thanks to Babban Gona\u2019s support Najiyu can store his maize and sell it at a future date for up to 37% higher than the market price at harvest. <br \/><br \/>As a Babban Gona member, Najiyu will benefit from marketing support that could see him generate earnings of up to $2,000 per hectare of land. Najiyu is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family, and looks forward to using his additional earnings to ensure that all his children get a post-secondary education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1887579,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase improved farm inputs that will increase crop yields.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-08T15:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-08T15:50:07Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Najiyu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":14625.6,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":14625.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-08T23:12:00Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":974608,"name":"Rosita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosita is 42 years old with two children.<br \/><br \/>Rosita has operated her eatery for five years and has been working hard, going to the market by 3:00 a.m. and cooking all the menu until closing down at 10 p.m. to support her family, especially for her children in school.<br \/><br \/>Rosita is requesting a loan amounting to PHP 17,000 to buy ingredients such as meat, fish, chicken, vegetables and spices for additional menu items in her eatery.<br \/><br \/>Rosita hopes to improve her eatery and expand to add a sari sari (variety) store to generate more income to save up for her children's future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2017847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients such as meat, fish, chicken, vegetables and spices for additional menu items in her eatery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tondo, Manila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":389,"posted_date":"2015-11-08T15:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-08T15:50:07Z","loan_amount":375,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":17000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1700},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-09T12:47:45Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":974612,"name":"Marlowe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marlowe is a resident of Tubigon, Bohol.

He is an energetic man living with his parents in the area of Lahore, Pakistan. He is supporting his sibling as well; his forefathers have been doing the same business for many years and he got all the buffalo\u2019s inheritance.<br \/><br \/>He is a milkman by profession; he sells milk in his community and produces yogurt and butter for his family members' personal use. He lives in a rural area and the roads are unpaved. He has to provide milk door-to-door by using his bicycle; it is very difficult for him to carry milk cans by bicycle. <br \/><br \/>He wants to access more customers so he can offer more milk and can generate more income for his family. He is facing a problem coping with the rapid increase in inflation and household expenses.
