Two of their children are in university, and the younger two are in their last years of high school school and middle school. Their sources of income are diverse. With the help of a loan Mamy started a small business. For two years she immersed herself in her laying hen enterprise, but she ended up having to sell all of her livestock because she fell ill. She now wants to start raising laying hens again and is applying for a second loan. She got the idea to launch the livestock business from her sister who has received training in the field. Mamy also works in the mornings as a part-time teacher at a public elementary school. She knows how to manage her time well. The couple live in a house that they inherited from their parents. Their aspiration is for their children to succeed in school. \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2012303,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy hens and livestock feed.

With Babban Gona\u2019s support, Safinah will store the maize she harvests and delay it\u2019s sale until a date later in the season when she can obtain a significantly higher price for her maize at a premium up to 37% more than the harvest price. <br \/><br \/>With the opportunity to earn up to $2000 per hectare of land, Safinah now has the opportunity to actualize her dream to grow her agriculture business for herself and family members and would like to use this additional income to ensure that all her children get a post secondary education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2017834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-08T18:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-08T18:00:05Z","loan_amount":50,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Safinah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":7312.8,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":50,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":7312.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-08T19:19:49Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kavita Shah","image":780734}},{"id":974570,"name":"Alma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alma lives in Badian, Cebu with her five school-aged children.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450-liter tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Global Harvest School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

The couple\u2019s combined income has successfully supported their children\u2019s simple needs. Now their children are already grown up and starting their own families.<br \/><br \/>Belen usually sells the fish that her husband catches. However, due to long time use, their nets are now ruptured and disintegrated. They have to make or buy new fishing nets to replace the old ones. For this reason, Belen is seeking your kindness to lend her PHP 8,000 to buy nets, rolls of nylon, and notches. <br \/><br \/>Belen wishes to buy another fishing boat that her neighbors can rent. As she and her husband approach their retirement age, they still hope to earn a living through boat rentals.<br \/><br \/>Belen is a devoted member of CCT Credit Cooperative and she regularly meets with her co-fellowship* members weekly to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Earning the primary income for her family, Gulan works in animal husbandry and crop cultivation, having started in 2005. Thanks to Gulan's tireless hard work, she currently has 2 cows on her farm. Additionally, she grows alfalfa for personal consumption and potatoes for sale on 2.25 hectares of land. Gulan's monthly profit is 14,000 som (KGS), but this is not enough means to support her family and raise and educate her children. In order to further develop her business, Gulan turned to the bank Bai Tushum for a loan in the amount of 50,000 som (KGS) to purchase fuel, hire workers and rent a tractor for harvesting and transporting the potatoes. Proceeds from the loan will allow Gulan to improve the wellbeing of her family.

Since her husband is still working abroad, Gohar has gotten used to all the hard farm work, livestock care (on her farm she has buffalos, pigs, and lots of chickens), and land cultivation (she has nice vineyard and apple, fig, and persimmon trees). Gohar sells a great assortment of very tasty farm products such as macun (national dairy-product) made of buffalo milk, pork, poultry, and eggs. She sells fruit right from her farm, but separates part of it for her family\u2019s use. Gohar lives with her school-aged children and mother-in-law.

His previous employment as a coffee shop assistant allowed him to acquire the knowledge to later open his own business.

From 4PM to 8PM, he offers his services as a messenger in a private company, where he delivers parcels on his bicycle. Elver wants to take advantage of the coming demand from the festivities in December, which kick-start business in general. Because of this he is able to sell many hot drinks to his clients who are on the streets early doing their jobs. In order to meet his goal, he is applying for a CrediKiva. This is the first financing he has done with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. He will invest it in coffee, aromatic bags, sugar, disposable cups, and new selection of articles of clothing.

Emma is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to ensure that all his children get a post secondary education.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2018623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-09T03:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-09T03:40:03Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emma","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":23043.29,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":23043.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-18T21:33:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Richard Neuman","image":null}},{"id":975116,"name":"Rabeccah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rabeccah is a maize farmer and Babban Gona member.

sociable young lady 23 years of age. She is divorced and has no children. Zaynura lives with her mother and younger brother. Her father works in Russia. After her divorce, for a long time she was unable to come to her senses, she agonised for a long time, but her caring mother always supported her in everything, and tried to help her forget about her past. \r\n\r\nNow Zaynura and her mother work at the market. She buys and sells vegetables. Early in the morning they go to the market to trade and earn at least a bit of money to survive. In order to improve their business, she has decided to expand it. But she does not have a sufficient amount of money, and the money which her father sends goes into paying for her brother's studies. Thus, she has applied to Arvand for a loan in order to expand her business. She thanks Arvand in advance for the support."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2016191,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits

She has specialised secondary education and works as a librarian in a school. \r\n\r\nAs a means of secondary income for her family, Orozkan works in animal husbandry and field husbandry, having started about 27 years ago. Thanks to Orozkan's persistent hard work, on her farm today there are a cow and ten sheep. On a rented land plot of 1.0 hectares, and a 0.37 hectare plot of self-owned land, she cultivates barley for sale. Orozkan's monthly income is about 16,000 som (KGS), and these funds are insufficient for adequately maintaining her family. \r\n\r\nThus, with the view of further developing her farm, Orozkan has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) in order to buy two steers for increasing her herd. The funds from the loan will allow Orozkan to improve her family's well-being, and invest in the further increase of her livestock herd."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2012174,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy two steers in order to increase her herd","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Alai distict","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-11-09T08:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-09T08:50:02Z","loan_amount":725,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orozkan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3877},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3647},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3754},{"due_date":"2016-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3865},{"due_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":3980},{"due_date":"2016-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4098},{"due_date":"2016-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4219},{"due_date":"2016-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4344},{"due_date":"2016-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4472},{"due_date":"2016-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4604},{"due_date":"2016-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4741},{"due_date":"2016-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4399}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.88},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.43},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.71},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.42},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.18},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.99},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.84},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.76},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.74},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-09T21:44:26Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cheryl Tan","image":null}},{"id":971832,"name":"Adriana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Adriana es una mujer emprendedora que tiene su propio negocio, el cual consiste en la fabricaci\u00f3n y venta de ropa \u00edntima.
