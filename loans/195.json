She lives in one of her family member's homes with her two daughters:  Katia, who is 7, and Maria, who is 5.  They are the motive for all of her efforts.  She has a business selling beer.  Her stand is located in the mining center called, \"La Rinconada.\"  Every weekend, she moves many boxes of beer to renew what has been consumed during the week.  She is a very happy and charismatic saleswoman.  This is why her customers prefer her over her competition.  What she likes the most about her job is talking with her customers since this makes her long work days more enjoyable.  She has done this work for 2 years and she thinks the most difficult part about it is transporting the boxes of beer from the city of Juliaca to the mine.  It is a long and tiring trip.  In the future, she hopes to have a store where she can offer her customers better service.  This is her first loan with Microfinanzas Prisma.  She knows that she has to make her payments on time and is willing to do this.  She is a very happy and collaborative member of her communal bank.

He is single and lives with her younger sister Eutenia and niece Xianela, in the house he inherited from his parents. The devotion he had towards his mother while she was living caused Felix not to have his own family. However, that didn't make him want to work any less, that is why she's been working for 40 years growing peas, potatoes, corn, and other vegetables in his own land and with help that he has hired. He is still able to take care of his land and his sister supports him by preparing his lunch every day. Additionally, he is also a bricklayer. He always made an effort to provide for his loved ones and that's why he likes his job and the reason that he is consided a father by his own family. What he enjoys most is to grow peas since he likes to see  how the plant grows. In the future he plans to repair and improve his house so that his nephews can have it. Additionally, he wants to rent his land so that he can increase his earnings and continue savings and thereby secure his retirement. This is his tenth loan with MFP. He is glad to belong to his communal group because it is very organized and taught him how to save. He is asking for PEN 2,500 to purchase eight bags of fertilizer and two bags of pea seeds.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rocio Vargas, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":510255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of pea seeds and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-21T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felix","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2504.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153923}],"funded_date":"2010-03-22T14:39:33Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rocio Vargas","image":null}},{"id":190834,"name":"Obioha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virgina is 47years old, married and has six children under her care.

He is married and the father of 3 children.  He makes a great effort to meet the needs of his children and to bring sustenance to his humble home.  His greatest need now is to buy young cattle to expand his business.  For this reason, Komiljon turned to IMON International, in order to obtain loans that will allow him to purchase these animals and make his business grow.     \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She thanks you for your support. As a borrower, to improve living standards, extra training is needed. Over 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.

She has 23 years of service at Hospital Asunci\u00f3n.  She has two children, a son who is in his third year of studying zoology at the agricultural university, and a daughter who is in fourth grade.  Candelaria considers that she rented a place to live for 18 years, and at the end of 2008, she thought she earned enough money to realize her dream of having her own home.  She acquired her home through C\u00e1ritas, where she paid $1,000.  She had the land that she purchased with her credits that AFODENIC offered her.  On this occasion, she is requesting her sixth credit, which she will use to build a small addition to her kitchen, to install electricity and water, and to construct a bathroom, which will give her home more comfort.  At the same time, she will accomplish the project that she set out to achieve and will have the possibility of moving into her own home, a dream that she has has for a long time.  With the support of AFODENIC, she can now offer her children their own roof to sleep under.  Although it is small, it is worthy and it's better because it's their own.  She has the support of her son, who makes money while he is not in class and shares with her.  She expresses that she always asks God to let her comply with her credit obligations because it is always necessary to serve him with confidence.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Al final tiene su recompensa, ya que le resulta gratificante la cosecha, ya que obtiene buenas ganancias econ\u00f3micas que le ayudan a la manutenci\u00f3n de su familia.

They have five children, but only two of them live with them.  Joselina is 17, and Sharon is 6.  They live in their own house, which is made from adobe (clay cobblestones), straw, and tile.  \r\n\r\nFor 26 years, with help from his wife, he has been growing potatoes, corn, and peas.  These are agricultural products from the Peruvian mountain range.  He also grows vegetables and a variety of flowers.  \r\n\r\nThis humble couple starts their day\u2019s work at four in the morning in order to water their crops.  They then return home to prepare food for their daughters to go to school.  They later return to work until nightfall.  According to Hilario, there are many times that he and his wife do not return home, and they take advantage of the night to continue working.  Due to the climate changes, they do the most self-sacrificing work.  At the end, they have their recompense because the harvest is gratifying.  They get good earnings, which helps support their family.  To Hilario, agriculture represents his whole life.  He learned to farm when he was very small, and it has served him to get his family ahead.  That is why he hopes to later plant a larger quantity.  At the same time, he raises sheep, pigs, and three heads of cattle to later sell at a good price.  \r\n\r\nBeing a man who wishes to improve, he is asking for a loan with MFP.  This is his eighth loan.  The most important thing to him is to keep working with his colleagues in his communal bank.  He wishes to use the loan to buy various pigs to fatten.  In the future he wants to have a farm in order to sell pork in the wholesale market in his city.  There is a great buyers\u2019 demand.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":459889,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-29T02:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":875}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":875,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":2520,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886636}],"funded_date":"2009-12-29T05:19:43Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":169796,"name":"Flor","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Flor es socia del Banco Comunal Ccatarisum que significa Levant\u00e9monos en quechua.\nFlor es soltera, tiene 34 a\u00f1os y 2 hijos, Flor tiene una tienda en su casa en donde vende bebidas al por mayor y menor, para lo cual tiene 2 personas que le apoyan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

plates and dishes for 15 years. In high demand, this kind of china is widely used for girls' dowries and for family celebrations.  Now Sanobar is planning to enlarge her range of goods and  purchase china in the neighboring countries of Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan and is therefore requesting a loan of 7000 Somoni. An active and strongly motivated client of IMON since 2006, her credit history makes her eligible to receive new and larger loans. The well-being of Sanobar\u2019s family and her business are in your hands. She and her children are sincerely grateful for your support.  <p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes:  its role as a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 35 years old and married with four school-aged children. To make a living, Alicia owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting a variety of vegetables for sale. Alicia has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Alicia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Alicia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI, which was used to invest in expanding her business. Alicia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP to again invest in expanding her business. This will be her third loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 21 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She earns her living by operating a general store.  Her husband Ferdinand, who is 45 years old, works as a driver to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are 4 to 23 years old. Angie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Angie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000, which she intends to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.  Angie is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Caridad is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase sewing materials and to repair an existing sewing machine.  This loan will be the twelveth loan taken out by Caridad from GDMPC.

She went into sales and when she had enough capital, she opened a small stall. In order to fulfill her dream of becoming a nurse, she enrolled in training as a pharmacist and she now owns a pharmacy, selling drugs to patients. Working 7 days a week and 16 hours a day, Mary earns about SLL 2,256,000 monthly from her business. \r\n\r\n<p>Mary has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan.

She usually orders twice a month through delivery van from Freetown. In the future, Mary plans to save enough money for her retirement. She feels good and nervous about the future prospects of her business because she needs someone with good experience and capabilities to run her business when she retires. She wants her child and her dependents to finish school. The loan will help as she will be able to save money. Mary is hardworking and honest.

For the past 3 years she has worked selling cosmetics from one of the most trusted and valuable brands available.  Luz sells her products by going to the houses of her friends and neighbors.  Due to her increased sales she has decided to expand her business by also selling clothing to health care workers in her area.  [By selling to more clients] she will have more security when she sells her products on credit.  Regardless, she has set clients that she sells to at their workplace, she knows where they are and what day she has to go collect her payments.  Luz looks toward the future with the expectation that she will continue to support her son.  This is the second loan cycle with MFP.  She went back to her community bank after two consecutive loans and was accepted because of her previous positive experiences, punctual payments and ability to work as a team.  Luz is asking for this money to purchase more cosmetics.  She will buy these products at a discount and then offer them to her clients on credit.  She will also buy clothing articles to sell--to start with she will purchase undergarments to sell.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva

Her candies have become well known in her area, but she would like to have a storefront in her house so that she can sell her candies there and avoid the walking.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Natividad's life is definitely not easy. Between cooking the candies and getting up early and walking the streets of Hato Mayor selling, she has very little time for herself and is often very tired from long days of work. She wants her three children (ages 11,12 and 15) to have a better life quality, which is why she is committed to suporting their education, hopefully until they become working professionals.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>Please help us to continue to support this hard-working group of entrepreneurs through this Kiva loan.

She has already profited from 11 previous loans.  She lives in Ouakam in the neighborhood of Touba, several meters from the bank.  She is married and the mother of eight children.  Her husband is a manual laborer and polygamous.  His income proves insufficient to cover all of the needs of the family.  Consequently, for over nine years she has developed a small restaurant, selling breakfast in front of her home.  Her profits allow her to support her children and take responsibility for a large part of her own personal needs.  She is asking for a loan of 100,000 frs to reinforce her business, as she plans to buy products that allow her to prepare her breakfast and back-stock these goods.  These products are sugar, peas, etc.  The loans from the institution will allow her to achieve a certain advancement in her business and a certain social stability.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Carolyn McMahon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":492488,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to strengthen working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"DAKAR","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.695112 -17.443886","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-02-21T22:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Coura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":11111.11},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11111.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11111.11},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11111.11},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11111.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11111.11},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11111.11},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":11111.11},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":11111.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":21686.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036666},{"amount":5,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2409.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759226},{"amount":17.5,"local_amount":7777.78,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":8433.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790739},{"amount":45,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:15:57Z","rounded_local_amount":21686.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708441},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":5555.55,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-23T09:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":6024.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708442},{"amount":50,"local_amount":22222.22,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:17Z","rounded_local_amount":24096.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189010},{"amount":25,"local_amount":11111.11,"processed_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":12048.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484449},{"amount":25,"local_amount":11111.12,"processed_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:48:35Z","rounded_local_amount":12048.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620691}],"funded_date":"2010-02-21T22:41:32Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:48:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Carolyn McMahon","image":null}},{"id":182622,"name":"Yareysi Mar\u00eda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Joven Yareysi Mar\u00eda Z.

She is 53 years old, a widow, and the mother of two children who are 36 and 32 years old, and who already have their own families. She never studied because her parents were without means, and left her to be raised by her grandparents. She lives in her own home, and has no other dependents since her children are already adults.\r\n\r\nMadalena never left the city where she was born. She has owned her own shop for more than 35 years. She has no employees, and earn around 3200 MZN per month, which she uses for household expenses along with help from her children.

His house is located in a peaceful town in the central mountains of Peru.  This hardworking gentleman has been farming since he was a young man.  Over the years he learned the necessary techniques that would help him achieve good production.  Benedicto currently grows peas and potatoes.  He looks after his crops with great care and takes his entire harvest to the wholesale market in the city, where he is able to sell his products at good prices.  This enables him to achieve a good quality of life.  What he dislikes the most is working alone because his son is in school, although he tries to help whenever he can.  During the harvest season, he hires laborers to help facilitate the work.  Being an entrepreneur, he has great plans for the future, one of them being planting in larger quantities so that he can generate more income.  In addition, Benedicto would like to acquire a few heads of cattle.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his fourth loan with MFP.  Benedicto is extremely grateful to everyone who made this loan possible because it will allow him to continue working.  He is also very pleased with the accomplishments of his group since the members are responsible individuals who are supportive of one another.  Benedicto plans to invest the money in the purchase of several sacks of seeds for planting peas, as well as compost, so that he can improve his production for the next planting.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":585587,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase sacks of compost & seeds for planting peas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-20T05:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benedicto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1541.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463106}],"funded_date":"2010-08-20T14:16:51Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":227738,"name":"Uranchimeg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Uranchimeg G. is 41 years old and lives with her husband and two daughters in Hovd province in western Mongolia.

In search of sources of income for this family, Chyngyz started his animal husbandry and farming business in 2007.  Thanks to his tenacity and persistence, his business now has 30 heads of sheep and 6 heads of cattle, yielding about 9,000 som (KGS) per month from sales of dairy and meat products.  He also works on one hectare of land, where he grows beans and multi-year herbs.  Chyngyz also provides tractor driving services for field work during the season.  In order to further increase his livestock headcount, he requested a loan in the sum of 80,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase livestock.  Chyngyz plans to invest the profit from this loan into further increasing his livestock quantities."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":946672,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Joon-Dobo village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-16T22:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chyngyz","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":431.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":646.88},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":646.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":431.25,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":20099.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095389},{"amount":646.88,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:44:17Z","rounded_local_amount":30149.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315329641},{"amount":646.87,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":30149.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070925}],"funded_date":"2011-12-23T06:05:48Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":379392,"name":"Alberto","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alberto is 52 years old, married and lives in the Philippines.

With that goal in mind, she began selling clothes to her neighbors and friends and, little by little, she's made herself known.\r\n<p>\r\nShe recently set up a small space in her house where she can store the clothes that she sells and where her customers can come and buy her merchandise.  However, she now has too large a supply of summer clothes which she can't sell because her customers are looking for clothes for the coming winter.  Rebeca is applying for a US$525 loan so that she can buy merchandise and have new stocks to offer her customers.

It is the Vietnamese New Year which is based on the Chinese calendar, a lunisolar calendar. The name T\u1ebft Nguy\u00ean \u0110\u00e1n is Sino-Vietnamese for Feast of the First Morning, derived from the H\u00e1n n\u00f4m characters \u7bc0\u5143\u65e6. In modern Chinese, the characters for Nguy\u00ean \u00d0\u00e1n (\u5143\u65e6) have evolved to refer to New Year in the Gregorian calendar, that is, January 1.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;\">Translated from Vietnamese by ngungo, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><br \/> \r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb L\u00ea Th\u1ecb L\u1ecbch, 57 tu\u1ed5i, l\u00e0 th\u00e0nh vi\u00ean n\u0103m th\u1ee9 5 c\u1ee7a Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng chi nh\u00e1nh 14 Qu\u1ea3ng X\u01b0\u01a1ng. 5 ng\u01b0\u1eddi con c\u1ee7a ch\u1ecb \u0111\u1ec1u \u0111\u00e3 tr\u01b0\u1edfng th\u00e0nh v\u00e0 ra \u1edf ri\u00eang, trong nh\u00e0 ch\u1ec9 c\u00f3 hai v\u1ee3 ch\u1ed3ng.

Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es aconsejarles a sus clientas sobre lo que mejor le quedara a su piel.

She lives in her own home along with her husband Jhon, 28, and their beloved daughter Nicol, 4, for whom she wants to provide a better quality of life. Luz sells beauty products, visiting her customers in their homes. She is a very persistent and persuasive saleswoman who is motivated to sell her cosmetics quickly. She is very well-known in her neighborhood, and they know the products she sells are of very high quality. What she enjoys most about her work is advising her clients on what best fits their skin. She has two years of experience and the thing she considers to be the most difficult is charging for the products since some customers don't pay on time. In the future, she hopes to have a cosmetics store where she can sell in more comfort and not have to go from house to house. This is her eighth loan with Kiva partner MFP. She wants to make her business grow, and she plans to make her payments on time so she can have access to more loans. Furthermore, she counts on the support of her community bank.

This is what he most enjoys as he makes monthly profits and there is a lot of demand.  In the central market in town, during potato season, traders give him a good price for his produce.  For this reason, he is planning to acquire more farmland where he will not only grow potatoes but also other products which grow in this area.  He is worried by his lack of working capital but he is certain that, with the help of his community bank, he will be able to achieve his goal.\r\n\r\nJuan is a member of the 'Miraflores de Casacoto' community bank and this is his fourth loan from MFP.

The need to feed, clothe, shelter and educate their children made Leordy even more determined to help her husband support their family so that her children would not be disadvantaged.\r\n\r\nHaving no idea where to get capital, Leordy was stumped until a friend invited her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon where she could have access to non-collateral loans to start her business. With her first loan, Leordy put up a small \"sari-sari\" or general store and was able to help her husband with the basic necessities of their family.\r\n\r\nLeordy discovered that she had the talent to run a business. A few years later, with the profits she earned from her general store and subsequent loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she was able to expand her business to include a small \"carinderia\" or eatery that sells cooked food to her neighbors. She now earns about PHP 45,000 per month from her various business activities.\r\n\r\nFor her 8th loan, Leordy wants to borrow PHP 11,000 to add to her capital so that she can sustain the momentum of her businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":427704,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase crops in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-11-18T07:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catherine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:50Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757664},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146758},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984903},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:55Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015576},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740582},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:07Z","rounded_local_amount":71824.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773696}],"funded_date":"2009-11-18T20:13:50Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":157461,"name":"Marcelino","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Marcelino T., a 45-year-old freelance videographer who lives in a fairly large village in San Mateo, Rizal.

This experience has allowed a slight growth of his business, but many times he does not have enough working capital to adequately stock his store, and he has to wait to pick up the money from his credit sales in order to stock the store and fulfill his clients. This is the reason for his first credit with the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo, because it will give him working capital to invest during a great season of the year, when sales usually increase. He will purchase cleaning supplies, baby clothing, and household goods, which he will pack with Christmas decorations, to attract the attention of his clients, during the season in which friends, neighbors, and relatives exchange gifts. His dream is to have a great, well-stocked store and his own house. However, his greatest challenge is the seasons in which sales decrease, and he has to figure out how to attract clients with low prices and a nice display. Otoniel is a very hard-working man with a lot of discipline in his job. His goals are clear, and he knows where his business is going. Currenlty, he has a working capital of $3.440.000 COP and a profit margin of 42.8%.

She is a very kind and hard-working young mother who lives in her own home with her husband, 26 year-old Agust\u00edn, and her 2 beloved children, 3 year-old Jairo and 1 year-old Estrella.  She would like to provide them with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nAlejandrina's business is growing cacao, coffee and coca leaf.  Every day she gets up very early in the morning and starts looking after her farm since she knows that the more care she takes of her crops, the more produce she will obtain at harvest time.  What Alejandrina most likes about her work is sowing her land and she does this with a lot of patience.  She has been in this business for 10 years and she considers that the most difficult part of her work is transporting her crops to the city of San Francisco which is where she sells them.  Over time, she would like to buy more land so that she can grow more crops.\r\n\r\nThis is Alejandrina's first loan with MFP.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

People work long hard hours for low wages that are not even enough to feed a family of four, much less a family with seven children. But Mrs. Marlyn C. of Hacienda Victoria, Tabao Rizal, San Enrique, Negros Occidental was determined to help her husband support their large family, and send her children to school.\r\n\r\nFor the past twelve years, since she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marlyn has engaged in food vending, selling a variety of nutritious snack food such as sugar-coated fried bananas, commonly known as \"bananaque\" because the bananas are sold skewered on barbecue sticks, to her neighbors and the surrounding communities within the sugar plantation where she lives.\r\n\r\nIn addition to food vending, Marlyn has a \"sari-sari\" or general store which her husband manages while she goes around selling her snacks to the field workers and their neighbors. The income they jointly earn helps in sending the three youngest children to school.\r\n\r\nFor her 9th loan, Marlyn is borrowing Php 9,500 to purchase a \"trisikad\" - a bike with a side-car so that she can use to go around the neighboring communities a lot faster and reach further to sell her snack food. Some of the loan will be used as additional capital for her food-vending and for the \"sari-sari\" (general) store.\r\n\r\nExplaining the term \"trisikad\":\r\n\r\nFilipinos are fond of coining new terms for the practical gizmos we dream up. Some of you might have read some \"Only in the Philippines\" anecdotes - and the trisikad is another one of those. The term trisikad is a combination of an English and Hiliganon (a dialect in Western Visayas) word - tricycle because of the three wheels (the bike + sidecar) - but then the term tricycle is already used for motorcycles with sidecars so to distinguish it, and to emphasize that it is not motorized, the Hiligaynon word \"sikad\" meaning to kick or to pedal was used instead - resulting in the uniquely Ilonggo \"trisikad\".\r\n\r\n\r\n About NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":371501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Ruth is 18 years-old and lives in the town of Kyotera in the Masaka area of Uganda.  She is married and has one child who is seven months old.  Ruth has a business running a retail and grocery shop which sells small goods and food items in Kyotera.  \r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Ruth is requesting a loan of 300,000 Ugandan Shillings from Kiva partner BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to buy more inventory and food  which Ruth will sell at her shop and grocery.  Ruth hopes to expand her business and sell more types of items which can draw more customers and benefit her and her family. \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. First, the ELA program provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age, improve their prospects for the future and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans and giving Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":559853,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She lives in her parents\u2019 house, along with her 30 year old husband, Humbert.  What she wants most is to excel in life by overcoming its obstacles.  Amelia\u2019s days begin early in the morning, when she and her husband walk for an hour to get to where their crops are.  This is where they begin their daily chores; working the land, raising peas, potatoes and carrots.  Since their crops are of good quality, they are sought after in central market in Tarma.  What they enjoy most about their work is caring for their crops.  They\u2019ve been doing this for eight years and they consider the most difficult part to be transporting their goods to Tarma, because the sacs they carry are very heavy and it wears them out.

He is 40, married, and the father of four children. He has been working in fishing for more than 25 years and at the same time, he raises sheep that he sells during the holy\/feast days. He chose the business of fishing because when he was a boy, he accompanied his father who was a fisherman. Moreover, it is a business where you earn a lot. He has been a member of the Yoff branch since March 2004. He has already been accorded five loans which he repaid correctly.
