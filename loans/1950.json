is 46, married, and has four children. She has a vocational education and is a farmer, having started a business in 1990 with 10,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Saltanatkhan's hard work, she was able to develop and expand her business, which earns about 15,000 som (KGS) per month. This is how she pays for her family's food and household needs. She currently has five cows and grows watermelons to sell on a 0.8 hectare plot of land. In order to develop her business, Saltanatkhan applied for a loan of 50,000 som (KGS) with Bai Tushum Bank to buy a cow with a calf to increase her livestock headcount. The earnings from the loan will help Saltanatkhan expand her business activities.

Kasimu is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to move to the city with his family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1903633,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-09T15:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-09T15:40:06Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kasimu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":13823.5,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":13823.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-12T21:42:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deb Hickman","image":null}},{"id":974508,"name":"Mamuka","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mamuka is a 41-year-old married man from Kobuleti city.

She not only takes care of her children but also has to take care of her elderly husband, who has become bedridden due to old age and illness. Mampolokeng lives in a small, traditional hut that is not well ventilated and does not warm up well in the winter. She works long hours to ensure there is enough food for her family. During the week, she has to wake up very early, between 3 and 4 am, to start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water to help bathe her elderly aunt, and warming the house for her young children who go to school. <br \/><br \/>Collecting firewood, setting up the fire, and doing the actual cooking demand a lot of her time. Temperatures in the Lesotho highlands are never really high; winters can get very cold, and often Mampolokeng has to start the fire inside her hut. Starting a fire releases smog and smoke, which, when inhaled in large quantities over a period of time, can lead to lung diseases, eye problems, and, in the worst cases, to death. In these circumstances, life for women like Mampolokeng has been very difficult. <br \/><br \/>ACE has requested a loan from Kiva lenders in order to be able to sell clean cookstoves on credit. The stoves will provide Mampolokeng and 11 other people from her village, who are living in the same circumstances, the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families and that neither requires a lot of wood, which is hard to find in Lesotho, nor requires expensive paraffin and gas . This stove can be started with the use of very small amounts of readily available biomass, like dry twigs and dry cow dung, which do not require significant lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the home. <br \/><br \/>This stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery that runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones, and a mini LED lamp. A life-improving package for these people, this stove saves them time to be with their families, saves energy, eliminates the threats of toxic inhalation and house fires, and gives them a better lit home in the evening while cooking and while the children are doing their homework.

Jummai is thankful that she now has the opportunity to improve the life of her children and family and looks forward to using her additional earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2019244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to eliminate the pressure to sell maize at low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-09T20:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-09T20:20:05Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jummai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":29029.76,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":29029.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-10T05:22:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Etchison","image":null}},{"id":975446,"name":"Angie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Angie is a 25-year-old single hard working entrepreneur. <br \/><br \/>Angie has had a food vending business for 4 years and requests 10,000 PHP through NWTF  to buy ingredients for her food vending business.<br \/><br \/> In the future, Angie would like to save enough money to expand her business."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2019256,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients for her food vending business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silay, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2015-11-09T20:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-09T20:30:04Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-09T21:16:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Etchison","image":null}},{"id":975448,"name":"Myrna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myrna is a hardworking entrepreneur who has had a fishing business for 3 years.. <br \/><br \/>She is borrowing 12,000 PHP through NWTF to buy fish nets and other fishing supplies for her fishing business.<br \/><br \/>Myrna has been sustaining her business activities through her own efforts with the help of the loans from NWTF.

She never misses an opportunity to joke with people and help create a climate of confidence.  She works planting corn and breeding lambs, both of which are common trades in the community in which she lives.  In this season, the houses are surrounded by stalks and cobs.  People are preparing for the harvest that will begin in November.  \"To work in the cornfield isn't easy,\" Ma Teresa says.  Fortunately she has had her own land for 4 years, in contrast to many others who have to rent parcels to sow.  The corn Ma Teresa harvests she uses principally to feed her family, but there is always a small portion left over that she can sell to earn a little extra.  <br \/><br \/>Her primary job is breeding lambs.  This allows her to help her husband with the household expenses.  Delfino, her husband, works in construction in the capital.  They only see each other on the weekends when he returns to their community.  During the week, Ma Teresa takes care of the animals, the parcel of land, and their 4 children.  Thanks to the loans of VFM\u00e9xico that she received 2 years ago and to her great effort, she has managed to make some renovations to her home, and can buy clothes and shoes for her little ones with greater ease. She will use the new loan to invest on buying some lambs and food. Nevertheless, there is still much to do, and she dreams of learning to cut hair and open a salon in the future.  The other members of the group are Lourdes and Mauricio who invest in bulls, Juana who invests in a store, and Clara and Mar\u00eda de Luz who invest in lambs.<br \/><br \/>*The photo was taken in the central plaza of the town where the members live.
