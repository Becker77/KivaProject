The climate is temperate so it is normal to see a deep green color of vegetation all year round. Much of the native grasses are therapeutic and are used as teas. On the other hand these communities are inhabited by very friendly and hard-working whose joy is shared with any visitor. Many still conserve their native language and their Saint days have features that have lasted through many generations.<br \/> <br \/>Flora is a member of a group in one of the above-mentioned communities. She is a very happy person of good humor who never goes unnoticed. Her greatest motivation comes from her small daughter who studies in primary school. She currently works making handcrafted clothing. 'Since I was small I watched how my mother made capes, bags, sweaters, scarfs and other clothing with Mazahua designs. The colors stand out and they have characteristic figures from the region\", she commented. <br \/><br \/>Once she formed her own family she decided to work full time in this business, going out to sell in other communities with the goal of increasing her income. The up coming season is the best of the year as sales increase considerably. So with the help of the loan she can buy more material and augment her production. Her busy time starts in the month of October so that coming up to the December season she has enough merchandise for any unforeseen orders. <br \/>   <br \/>The dream that she carries in her mind is to increase her production and provide work for new people. She is also looking to set up in a shop so people can see her crafts in detail. \"For now I am confident that things are going well as the cold has arrived and it is our best opportunity to sell the product of our efforts\", she commented enthusiastically. <br \/><br \/>The other members of the group are Paula, Rosalina, Maximina, Mar\u00eda Eugenia and Araceli who will also invest in handicraft embroidery.<br \/><br \/>*The photograph was taken in the plaza in the municipal center.

Aside from the traditional showing of bovine animals, there are exhibits on artisanal, industrial and cultural production, as well as exhibits for different services. In one of this area's communities, a group called \"Lucecitas\" was formed. The members of this group include: Lucia, who sells handmade bags, cosmetics and containers; Esbeydi, who sells snacks and corn on the cob; Nayeli, who sells food; and Victor, who sells groceries. Also, Severo provides gardening services; Daniela, beauty services, and Jorge repairs cell phones.   <br \/><br \/>Lucia has formed a family together with her husband, Florentino, and their four children, all of whom are now adults. More than 28 years ago, she decided to begin selling cosmetics and plastic containers via catalog with the clear purpose of supporting her husband with the household expenses. As the years passed, her business grew stronger to such a level that with the profits, she was able to provide an education to all of her children, make improvements to her home, satisfy her personal pleasures, and begin a new business. <br \/><br \/>And so, after taking a craft course, she began to create and sell handbags which she makes by hand. She happily shares, \"I am very happy with my businesses and am proud to be a productive woman.\" She is currently waiting for the support of VFMexico in order to buy embroidery fabric, stones, ribbons, blush, eyeshadow, lip liner, and containers in order to stock all of her businesses. <br \/><br \/>On the other hand, the members of the group share: \"thank you for the loan and for motivating us to continue with our businesses.\"<br \/><br \/>*The picture was taken in the backyard.

The most harvested product here is sugar cane, making this area one of the biggest producers in the country. <br \/><br \/>In this community there is credit group called \"La Gloria\" who take their name from one of the typical desserts of the region. The group is made up of Sandra and Zuleima, who sell shoes; Rolando and Irma, who sell food; Jose, Elvira and Ruth, who sell typical cakes; Ana, who sells cosmetics, underwear and cakes; Maria, who sells cakes and soft drinks; and finally Antonio; who sells fish.<br \/><br \/>Jose is a friendly man, well-known for his sense of humor and his dedication to his work. He goes by the nickname \"Wuicho\" in his community. <br \/><br \/>He comes from a family with a great tradition of making and selling typical cakes and sweet things. \"I started going out with my parents when I was only seven, to sell our products around the neighboring communities\" he cheerfully tells us. He now boasts 38 years' experience in this line of work. \"I started a business using the skills I learnt as a boy out of necessity.\"<br \/><br \/>Once he has carefully prepared his products, he sets out to sell them on the streets where his customers are waiting to buy his delicious cakes. He starts making them in the morning. His typical tasks include grating coconut, shelling nuts and grinding them, placing his earthenware pans on the heat and mixing water, sugar, cheese, etc to make the traditional fudge. <br \/><br \/>He always aims to satisfy his customer demand, with the best quality product possible at an affordable price. \"Making these sweet treats runs in the family. These recipes have been passed down from generation to generation and have given us success.\"<br \/><br \/>After two loan cycles away, he has reincorporated in the group and he will use this new loan to buy seeds, coconut, pineapple, and sugar; as well as oil, sausages and tortillas so he can also start to offer tacos. <br \/><br \/>The photograph was taken at \"La novia del sol\" sitting on a unused well. Jose is wearing a long-sleeved checked shirt. He has a basket in his lap which he uses to carry his products."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2012054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy food ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"La Palma, Oaxaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-11-10T09:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-10T09:20:02Z","loan_amount":3075,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rolando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zuleima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":50400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2015-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3150},{"due_date":"2016-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.18},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.18},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.18},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":192.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-15T11:11:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Walker","image":1333070}},{"id":975644,"name":"Ihsan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ihsan is a 52 year-old Lebanese married woman living with her husband and four children.

One of the activities of the locals here is women making typical clothing because they are proud of their heritage.<br \/><br \/>This is where the community bank group called Tamarindo was formed since it is a very common tree and fruit in the area.

She has six children and wants to give them the best she can every day.  Her husband Tomas comes from a family of fishermen and taught her everything she needed to learn to carry out the fishing business which she has been doing for 20 years.  Since then they have been traveling together to the dam where they take a boat or raft out in the water.  At the end of the day they return with sufficient mojarra fish to sell the next morning to customers.  The average is 15 to 20 kilos a day which provides a good income.<br \/><br \/>They also raise a variety of banana called \"macho\" which they sell at the community market with leaves to make tamales.  \"We work together happily\" says Juana whose children help maintain the work tools and boats.  Although she is thinking about acquiring a motor boat, the family thinks the row boat is a way of preserving the fishing tradition.<br \/><br \/>To continue with her success, Juana will invest the VF Mexico loan in buying netting, rope, lead and cork to make new nets.<br \/><br \/>* The photo was taken at an inactive well.

Una vez que adquiere los fondos necesarios reinvierte en el negocio y aumenta la cantidad de mercanc\u00eda para tener variedad y calidad.\n   Por otro lado, se encuentra muy contenta con los beneficios que VFM\u00e9xico ofrece pues comprar\u00e1 chamarras, pantalones, sudaderas, polos, bufandas y especialmente prendas para el fr\u00edo debido a la temporada venidera. Su meta actual es enriquecer su negocio al grado de poder abrir un local al que todos puedan reconocer dentro de su comunidad.\n   Las dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo son Martina, Carolina y Erika quienes invertir\u00e1n en materiales para realizar bordados artesanales.\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en el lugar donde se re\u00fanen, Sol es quien viste una sudadera negra; tambi\u00e9n se pueden observar algunos bordados de Do\u00f1a Martina.\n","en":"The group called Las Tres Cruces [\"The Three Crosses\"] is found in a picturesque community in the State of M\u00e9xico. The members decided on this name because there are three crosses located in their community that give identity to the inhabitants. These symbols are celebrated in the month of May, especially by the people who make a living in construction since they dedicate their work to this religious symbol.<br \/><br \/>Marisol is a very hardworking person. Her jovial personality makes her one of the most joyful and enthusiastic members of the group. Her two children, who attend primary school, are the motivation that prompted her to launch a productive business.<br \/><br \/>Sol, as she is called with affection, has been buying and selling clothes for six years. Her idea arose when she realized that the people in her community needed an affordable way to buy clothing. \"My mam\u00e1 was a fundamental part of starting this business since she buys the merchandise at a more affordable price and I offer it in the community and make a good profit,\" she comments. One of the reasons that her business has been profitable is that she allows her customers to pay in installments, in anywhere from two to four payments. Once she earns the necessary funds, she reinvests in the business and increases the amount of merchandise so that she can offer variety and quality.<br \/><br \/>In addition, Sol is very happy with the benefits that VisionFund M\u00e9xico offers since she can buy jackets, pants, sweatshirts, t-shirts, scarves, and especially clothing for upcoming cold season. Her current goal is to grow her business to the point that she will be able to open a store where everyone in her community can come to shop.<br \/><br \/>The rest of the members of the group are Martina, Carolina, and Erika, who will buy materials to make handcrafted embroideries.<br \/><br \/>*The photograph was taken where the group meets. Sol is wearing the black sweatshirt. Some of Martina's embroideries can also be seen."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1999843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Guadalupe Cote, San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-11-10T11:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-10T11:50:03Z","loan_amount":4400,"lender_count":119,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erika ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":72000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":4400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":4442.41},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":4540.88},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":4641.54},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":4744.43},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4849.6},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":4957.09},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":5066.98},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":5179.29},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5294.1},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":5411.46},{"due_date":"2016-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":5531.41},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5654.02},{"due_date":"2016-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5779.35},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":5907.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":271.48},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":277.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":283.65},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":289.94},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":296.37},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":302.93},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.65},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":316.51},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":323.53},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330.7},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":338.03},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":345.52},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":353.18},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":361.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-23T02:35:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Kruch","image":null}},{"id":972398,"name":"Amy Diop's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce groupe de 21 membres fait partie du banc villageois qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9e en f\u00e9vrier 2014.

Rabi is thankful that she now has the opportunity to improve the life of her children and family and looks forward to using her additional earnings to diversify her farm and grow other crops."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2019567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-10T12:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-10T12:10:05Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rabi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":22776.88,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":22776.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-11T11:29:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JenniferN"}},{"id":973127,"name":"Jose Leonidas","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jose de 34 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su esposa y sus tres hijos, el se dedica a la venta de pan frances vende en su moto por las diferentes colonias que se encuentran cerca de su casa desde hace 12 a\u00f1os con las ganancias que realiza de sus ventas logra solventar algunos gastos de su hogar, el esta solicitando un credito para la compra de mas pan frances por mayor para continuar con sus ventas y asi tener mejores ingresos economicos.","en":"Jose, 34 years old, lives in his own house with his wife and their three children.

She has a husband, a pensioner father and two children. Sadly, for lack of economic resources, she was unable to study for a professional career.  <br \/><br \/>Tea works hard on family-owned agricultural land, growing maize, which is sold to local retailers. Her husband is employed and has also a fixed income. However, the whole income is hardly enough, and the family members find it hard to make financial stability. <br \/><br \/>Tea decided to start a stable activity and somehow increase her family's living conditions. According to the above-mentioned situation, she lacks the access to capital markets and financial institutions to obtain credit for starting a business.

She started a bread-making business in order to help with family expenses and her children's schooling.  She operates the business from her modest house and goes from street to street to sell what she makes.  She is applying for a loan that she will use to buy the supplies she needs to make more pan de coco, yucca cakes and other pastries that she will resell.  For the future, she wants to add a space to her house that she can use for a shop.  She hopes to grow her business and build a better life for her children.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2015835,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies for her bakery business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Bilwi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":328,"posted_date":"2015-11-10T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-10T17:10:03Z","loan_amount":550,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"K Atheen Bianka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":14700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2015-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2015-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2015-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2015-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1050},{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1050}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.29},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.28},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-10T19:25:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":973550,"name":"Belen - Quero Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Este es el grupo \u201cBelen - Quero\u201d y est\u00e1 formado por 06 integrantes responsables.

She wants her children to earn a college degree. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. <br \/> <br \/> * All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Upen has secondary education. As a main source of income for her family, she works as a kindergarten teacher. She has also worked with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation for a period of ten years. <br \/><br \/>Thanks to Upel's persistent work, her farm currently has one cow. She also rents 2.0 hectares of land, on which she grows beans and clover for selling every year.

With Babban Gona\u2019s support, Alhaji Hassan can store his maize and sell it in the future for up to 37% higher than the market price at harvest. <br \/><br \/>Alhaji Hassan is grateful to be part of the Babban Gona family and in the end hopes to use his increased earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2020138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-10T20:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-10T20:20:06Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alhaji Hassan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":43829,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":43829}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-09T20:44:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":973647,"name":"Gloria Gabriela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gloria Gabriela es una mujer casada, madre de tres hijos quienes dependen econ\u00f3micamente de ella.

","en":"Amriddin is a young and active farmer. He lives in the Hamadoni region, and has three children. He lives with his mother, brother, daughter-in-law, wife and children. Amriddin works in the buying and selling of livestock. He buys cattle, fattens them for several months, and then resells them at the livestock market. Amriddin is following in the footsteps of his grandfather, and earns a living purely by raising cattle.

He is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family, and looks forward to using his additional earnings to move into a better home with his family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2020106,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-10T23:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-10T23:50:05Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ayuba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":46236.52,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":46236.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-09T21:05:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":973680,"name":"Jose Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jose de 34 a\u00f1os de edad vive en casa propia con su esposa y sus dos hijos, el se dedica desde hace 15 a\u00f1os a la agricultura siembra ma\u00edz, comercializa sus productos en los diferentes mercados que se encuentran cerca de su casa, con lo que obtiene de sus ventas logra solventar algunos gastos de su hogar, el est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito para la compra de semillas, fertilizantes, abonos, controles de plagas, etc. y mejorar el terreno que muestra en la fotograf\u00eda para poder continuar con su trabajo y tener mejores ingresos.","en":"Jose is 34 years old and lives in his own home with his wife and two children.

Dahiru is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to ensure that all his children get a post

She is a single mother and lives with her 3 children: a 13 year old girl and two boys, 17 and 18 years old. She is always showing her hard work, and thanks to it she has been able to move her children forward. She has been rendering domestic services and also selling chicken by weight, and with this she supports her household and helps her children with their studies. Genara wants to build a wall in her house, because as one can see on the photograph, the kitchen area is not protected and she worries for the safety of her family.
