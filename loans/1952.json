Thanks to Babban Gona\u2019s support Basiru can store his maize and sell it at a future date for up to 37% higher than the market price at harvest. \nAs a Babban Gona member, Basiru will benefit from marketing support that could see him generate earnings of up to $2000 per hectare of land.

Mathew is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2019965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell his maize for low prices at harvest time.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-11T19:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-11T19:10:03Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mathew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":14625.6,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":14625.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-13T04:26:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Lewis","image":null}},{"id":976312,"name":"Rabab","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rabab is a single 24-year-old lady who opened her photography shop in 2012.

Haruna is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to build a house a house for his family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1904232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-11T21:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-11T21:00:04Z","loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Haruna","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":85710.81,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":85710.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-10T02:28:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":974216,"name":"Victor David","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"V\u00edctor necesita de tu apoyo, un capital de trabajo para iniciar un negocio de transporte de personas en zona rural, es un joven soltero de 25 a\u00f1os de edad que sue\u00f1a con una mejor calidad, con tener un negocio y generar los ingresos para su sostenimiento, no quiere ser una persona mantenida, sue\u00f1a con tener una casa propia, carro y solo le queda trabajar con mucho empe\u00f1o, dedicaci\u00f3n y amor para lograr sus objetivos.\nEl monto del dinero ser\u00e1 destinado en la compra de una motocicleta, espera tener \u00e9xito y llev\u00e1rselo muy bien con las dem\u00e1s personas que ofertan dicho servicio, ser un competidor sano y ante todo generar recursos que apoyen el sostenimiento de su familia y le permitan seguir so\u00f1ando.\n","en":"Victor needs your help, a working capital to start his own taxiing business in a rural zone.

They are also very loyal to their customs and traditions which have prehispanic and colonial features. One of the celebrations they celebrate with more joy is that of their regional saint and December 12, the day of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Their togetherness is undoubtedly one of the characteristics that make this village unique. Alicia is an exemplary woman who has worked her whole life to improve her life quality. The motivation that makes her work hard every day is her family, formed by her husband J. Guadalupe with whom, for twenty years, she has supported their five children who are studying in the community. Ali, as she is fondly called, started buying and selling vegetables for more than ten years. \"I have always looked for ways to help with household expenses and my children's education, from raising sheep to the business of vegetables and fruits, everything with the purpose of helping them\", she comments happily. Currently, she sells at town squares of different towns, while her husband works delivering at grocery stores of at least 10 communities, and for this reason their earnings have increased. Nevertheless, Ali continues raising sheep because it is a profitable and traditional activity in her household. Also, she is very grateful for the loan offered by VFM\u00e9xico, because she can buy more fruits and vegetables to offer a great variety to her customers. With the obtained earnings they have remodeled their house and satisfied the basic needs of their household and their children's education.

This name was chosen by its members, since it is the same as that of a little girl, the daughter of a member. It is worth mentioning that they have a great bond to their traditions, religious as well as popular, and on the holidays they spend time together in a friendly and even sisterly way.<br \/><br \/>Everyone affectionately calls Yolanda \"Yola,\" since they think highly of her and have confidence in her because of her kind and dependable character. She is the mother of two daughters, one of whom is Galilea. They attend primary school and are her great motivation for continuing forward. For 12 years she has been working in commerce. Initially, she sold belts, but with time she found more favorable income in cleaning products, and since then she has not stopped. She and her husband coordinate between themselves to sell, acquire merchandise, and care for their little ones, for whom they make all this effort. \"Generally we travel some days to obtain earnings, and we come back a little afterwards to rest and spend time with our daughters,\" she commented. <br \/><br \/>One of the seasons in which they obtain greater earnings is that of the end of the year, since many people look for items to make the Christmas or New Year's dinner. She will use the new loan to buy cleaning products and cooking items. Selling as street vendors helps them to have greater contact with potential customers and also to give them more specific attention. Their present goal, nevertheless, is to acquire a fixed location in order to be able to increase their sales and exhibit the artisanal embroideries that Yolanda does to have extra income.<br \/><br \/>The other members of the group are Ra\u00fal, who will invest in domestic articles; Juana, in costume jewelry; Maria and Rub\u00e9n, in cleaning products; Maria Esther in plastic products; and Maribel, in clothing.<br \/><br \/>The photograph was taken on the steps of the municipal kiosk.

She is looking to take on a new challenge that will also help support her family. Fiskani resides in a town called Zomba in the southern part of Malawi and she is looking to start running her own business as a Zoona mobile money transfer agent.<br \/><br \/>Fiskani aspires to become an independent individual who is fully capable of supporting her family. Currently, the economy in Malawi makes it difficult for young people to find gainful employment. This makes it difficult for Fiskani to support herself. She believes that becoming a Zoona agent will turn this situation around. <br \/><br \/>Fiskani has a certificate in Hotel Management and loves working with people. She would like to use that knowledge to make a success of running her own mobile money transfer business. She would like to use the revenue generated to improve her current standard of living. Fiskani would also like to help her community thrive by becoming a viable, trustworthy alternative in a country where banking is simply too expensive.  She would like to achieve this by taking safe money transfer facilities to her community.<br \/><br \/>Fiskani has requested her first Kiva loan in order to procure her own trolley and a phone, which she can use to serve her customers. The loan will also provide Fiskani the funds needed to serve her customers.

With the opportunity to earn up to $2,000 per hectare of land, he hopes to realize better yields and plans on using his additional income to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2020970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, thus eliminating the pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest time.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-12T07:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-12T07:20:02Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ayuba ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":10731.77,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":10731.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-17T15:09:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sally Otway","image":1443524}},{"id":974259,"name":"Cruz Angel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Cruz tiene 47 a\u00f1os de edad en los cuales siempre ha mostrado su tenacidad, por lo que desde hace 8 a\u00f1os se dedica a la venta de pescado de forma ambulante, adem\u00e1s buscando obtener mejores ingresos vende productos de belleza por cat\u00e1logo.
