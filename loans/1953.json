Joshua is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family, and looks forward to using his additional earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1904754,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating the pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest time.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-12T12:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-12T12:50:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joshua","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":37975,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":37975}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-04T13:32:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Lush","image":null}},{"id":976599,"name":"Jose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jose is 55 years old, married and has five children.

a skilled tradesperson. One must have talent for this as in any other sphere. Despite her young age, Zaytuna, from the city of Tursun-zoda, can already call herself skilled at using her talent to embroider handcrafted goods such as pillowcases. She is 19 and has a small family - just her mother and father.\r\n\r\nZaytuna admits that embroidery is her favourite activity. Like many women, she learned to embroider from her mother and now continues doing this craft with pleasure. The embroidered goods she makes have many buyers at the local market, and she also embroiders to order. She wants to improve her sewing skills and to expand her selection of goods. She is requesting a loan to buy fabric and sewing supplies."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2016115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric and other sewing supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Tursun-zoda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2015-11-12T14:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-12T14:40:02Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zaytuna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":124.87},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":143.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":142},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":145.96},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":152.38},{"due_date":"2016-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":167.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":166.5},{"due_date":"2016-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":177.79},{"due_date":"2016-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":183.82},{"due_date":"2016-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":189.77},{"due_date":"2016-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":199.25},{"due_date":"2016-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":206.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.29},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.32},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.07},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.72},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.76},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.3},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.06},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.89},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.87},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.84},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.38},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-13T17:51:54Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kat Tancock","image":1418960}},{"id":976287,"name":"Sanavbar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sanavbar is young and clever woman.

Life in a third-world country is quite hard, and most families struggle to make ends meet. Her husband's salary as a driver is not enough to meet their daily household needs, so Maricris thought of putting up a small general store to augment their income.<br \/><br \/>Maricris has been running her store for two years now and is doing quite well. She buys essential food items and toiletries from wholesalers and then sells them at retail prices. To help her expand operations of her store she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan to buy more grocery items such as canned goods, instant noodles, biscuits, bread, eggs, charcoal, toiletries, etc., to sell at her small store. She is thanking God and you in advance for your valued help.<br \/><br \/>Maricris dreams that someday she will own a bigger grocery store. She plans to send her child to preschool.

In the time since, he has been able to buy his own moulds and materials, such as plaster, paints and gasoline and opened his own workshop. <br \/>Today, as she decorates the pieces, she also looks after mixing all the materials until they reach the smooth consistency required to afterwards mould each figure with unique dedication. <br \/>The themes most frequently used by Flor are horses, chickens and religious images. She sells them in the markets in her town and they also have a list of customers who request personalized items.<br \/>For the other side, she is very grateful for the opportunity to receive the loan. It will enable her to buy plaster, paints, tables, wire rods, solvents and gasoline. <br \/>\"With each investment that I make I can strengthen my business. I can also buy shoes, clothing and cover the costs of the home and the education of my children.\" she comments. In the same way, she could make improvements to her home and buy a vehicle in which she can transport their handicrafts.

En esta ocasi\u00f3n el pr\u00e9stamo lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de arena, relleno, piedra y 2 llantas para el cami\u00f3n con el que transporta el material m\u00e1s pesado. \n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en el patio de la mam\u00e1 de Concho donde guardan los camiones; el taxi que se observa detr\u00e1s es de Daniel quien tambi\u00e9n vende material para construcci\u00f3n. Concho es quien viste un chaleco fosforescente. \n","en":"The R\u00edo Blanco group is located in the community of \"La novia del sol\" (The Bride of the Sun), named by local poets for the fact that the climate is hot every day of the year.  The name of the group refers to a common place for all of the members who are very proud of their origins. The group is made up of: Jos\u00e9 and Leticia, construction materials, Beatriz M., cosmetics, Carlos, construction materials and taxi service, Ana, sweets, Iliana, Cynthia, and X\u00f3chitl, silver items, Beatriz, desserts, Mar\u00eda T., footwear, and Mar\u00eda V., food.  \r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Concepci\u00f3n is known by all as \"Concho\" and is father to 4 children, 3 of whom are still dependent on him economically.  20 years ago, his parents encouraged him to start selling construction materials, primarily sand, gravel, brick, cement, and the like, which he stores in large storerooms.  \"My father dedicated his life to this business, and now it will be passed down through the family since we want to follow his example\", he noted with a big smile.  Without a doubt, what he enjoys the most is fulfilling the needs of his customers, since his labor allows them to carry out their dreams of building houses, bridges, schools, or anything that the community may need.  \"I hope that this business expands and endures for many generations\", he added.  \r\n\r\nEach time that he has received support from VFM\u00e9xico, it has been useful for him since he has enriched his business in a gradual manner and presently provides employment for 12 people.  This time, he will use the loan to buy sand, filler, and two tires for the truck that he uses to transport heavier materials.  \r\n\r\n*This photo was taken in Concho's mother's courtyard where they keep the trucks.  The taxi pictured in the background belongs to Daniel, who also sells construction materials.  Concho is wearing a fluorescent vest.

She is seeking a loan to be able to cover the costs of her education. This is her story: \"My name is Cristina. I am 29 years old and I am the second youngest of seven siblings. I was born in a community called Guayabal in the province of Azua. I lived there with my parents and siblings until I was nine years old, when my mother decided to separate from my father. <br \/><br \/>My mother got a job cleaning a family home, and she worked hard to support us, but her salary did not cover the household expenses. This is why I started working at a very early age to help my mother cover the costs of the home. I am currently living in Guaricanos. I am married and have a four month old baby.<br \/><br \/>I completed my secondary education at 19. When I finished I wanted to study dentistry at UASD. I took the admission exams and passed them, but due to the high cost of pursuing this degree, psychologists at this university recommended that I study social psychology. Following their recommendation, I pursued these studies for two years, but I was disappointed and my lack of passion for this subject caused me to leave the program.<br \/> <br \/>At the end of 2012 I decided not to give up and to follow my dreams of studying dentistry. I enrolled in the Universidad Federico Henr\u00edquez y Carvajal (UFHEC), and to date have studied 18 subjects.<br \/><br \/>The middle of last year I had to suspend my studies due to complications with my pregnancy. At birth my son had a complication, and between medications, medical expenses and other commitments at home, there is not sufficient income to cover the cost of my university studies anymore.<br \/><br \/>I have promised myself that I will reach my goal of becoming a successful dentist and giving my son a better childhood than I had, but I can not reach this goal alone. This is why I have come to FUNDAPEC \/ KIVA to ask for help for me to be able to finish my studies.<br \/><br \/>I know that with help I can finally reach my dream. If FUNDAPEC \/ KIVA will consider me and I am able to become a professional, my goal is to contribute oral health to people with few resources, offering them services free of charge, and in that way pay back a little bit of the help that I have

Para poder llegar a la comunidad se deben recorrer 3 r\u00edos siendo el de Chichicazapa el m\u00e1s atractivo pues el agua est\u00e1 limpia y suele haber personas de la comunidad mitigando el calor y teniendo un tiempo de esparcimiento. \n   En otra comunidad se integr\u00f3 un grupo llamado Los Girasoles cuyos miembros se comparan con esta bella flor ya que su jornada empieza y termina con la luz del sol. Ellos son: Mar\u00eda Del Carmen quien invertir\u00e1 en un club nutricional; Andrea, comida; Mar\u00eda Elena, ropa; Mar\u00eda Esther, pollo; Daniel, carpinter\u00eda y carnicer\u00eda; Trinidad, mariscos; Viridiana, pescado; \u00c1ngel, abarrotes y Adri\u00e1n, servicios de alba\u00f1iler\u00eda. \n   Daniel es mejor conocido como el \"chalan\" ya que este nombre reciben los ayudantes de alg\u00fan oficio como la carpinter\u00eda o la alba\u00f1iler\u00eda y aunque ahora ya es maestro sigue conservando el mote. Hace 5 a\u00f1os decidi\u00f3 abrir su propia carpinter\u00eda para lo cual adecu\u00f3 su patio trasero para poder disfrutar del clima fresco mientras trabaja. No obstante al inicio tuvo muchos retos que superar, \"como com\u00fanmente decimos aqu\u00ed: apret\u00e9 la panza para gastar menos y poder comprar mi herramienta\" coment\u00f3 orgulloso. \n   El \u00e9xito que ha cosechado le ha permitido brindar empleo a una persona m\u00e1s y ampliar su taller. Asimismo desde hace 4 meses, con ayuda del pr\u00e9stamo y las ganancias obtenidas, inici\u00f3 con la venta de carne de cerdo en un puesto ubicado en el mercado municipal. Entre sus planes inmediatos est\u00e1n el ser la carnicer\u00eda m\u00e1s grande de la regi\u00f3n para que de esta manera puedan generar mayores ingresos y empleos. \n    El pr\u00e9stamo que ha recibido le ser\u00e1 de utilidad para la compra de 1000 pies de madera y 10 cerdos continuando as\u00ed con ambas actividades.\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en un viejo pozo, Daniel es quien viste una playera color caf\u00e9.\n","en":"In Oaxaca, it is common to appreciate the richness of the earth reflected in the plantations of sugarcane, corn, and beans, as well as the mango, orange, and lemon trees.  To arrive at their community, one must travel around three rivers, the most attractive of which is Chichicazapa, since the water is clean and you can often find people from the community taking refuge from the heat and spending some leisure time.  \r\n\r\nIn another community, a group called Los Girasoles (\"The Sunflowers\") was formed, whose members compare themselves to this beautiful flower since the day begins and ends with the light of the sun.  The group members are:  Mar\u00eda Del Carmen, who will invest in a nutrition club, Andrea, food, Mar\u00eda Elena, clothing, Mar\u00eda Esther, chicken, Daniel, carpentry and butcher shop, Trinidad, seafood, Viridiana, fish, \u00c1ngel, groceries, and Adri\u00e1n, a bricklayer.  \r\n\r\nDaniel is better known as \"el chalan\", since this is the name that is given to assistants of trades such as carpentry or bricklaying, and even though he has become a master of the trade he continues to keep the nickname.  The success that he has been able to achieve has allowed his to provide employment to one other person and to expand his workshop.  Likewise, for the past 4 months, with the help of the loan and the profits that he has obtained, he started selling pork from a stall in the municipal market.  His plans for the immediate future are to be the the biggest butcher shop in the region so that he can generate a better income and more employment.  The loan that he has received will be used to buy 1,000 feet of dry cedar and 10 pigs so that he can continue along with both businesses.  \r\n\r\n*This photo was taken in an old well.

Una gran mayor\u00eda de los habitantes de dichas comunidades se dedican a esta labor a\u00f1o con a\u00f1o.\n   En un municipio en especial se ha formado un grupo el cual lleva por nombre Centro ya que se encuentra justo en la cabecera del mismo. Sus integrantes son: Nisha quien invertir\u00eda en la cr\u00eda de ovejas; Pragedes, cuarter\u00eda; Eugenia, panader\u00eda; Lorena, cosm\u00e9ticos y ropa; Mar\u00eda del Carmen, cosm\u00e9ticos y tamales; Porfirio, tacos; Martha, carnicer\u00eda y Jesika con Felipa, ropa. \n   Do\u00f1a Eugenia es una mujer con mucho carisma y entusiasmo,  est\u00e1 casada con Jorge quien se dedica a trabajar en el campo por las ma\u00f1anas y a vender pan por las tardes.

Workers can be seen in groups cutting and gathering piles of it to later carry it to trucks with the help of special machinery. A great majority of the inhabitants of these communities perform this work year after year.<br \/><br \/>In one municipality in particular, a group has formed that goes by the name of Centro, since they are right in the middle of it. The members are: Nisha, who invests in raising sheep, Pragedes, in room rental, Eugenia, a bakery, Lorena, cosmetics and clothing, Mar\u00eda del Carmen, cosmetics and tamales, Profirio, tacos, Martha, a meat market and Jesika and Felipa, clothing.<br \/>   <br \/>Do\u00f1a Eugenia is a woman with a great deal of charisma and enthusiasm. She is married to Jorge, who works in the fields in the morning and sells bread in the afternoons. Both of them produce sugar cane and during the harvest season, he works only in the fields while she looks after the bakery which they have run for 5 years.<br \/><br \/>They treat their customers well. The bread is of a good consistency and flavor that makes one think of stone ovens. In addition, if customers buy more that 10 items they get an attractive discount. These things make her one of the best in her community despite the competition.<br \/> <br \/>To ensure that the product is always of the same quality, she must get up at 4 in the morning to prepare the dough, grease the pans and begin to make the different kinds of bread. The most noted kinds are \"polvorones, novias, caprichos\" and the traditional \"bolillos\".<br \/><br \/>The loan that she has received will be invested in the purchase of flour, eggs, lard, yeast, salt, milk, sesame seeds and gas, since her customers have asked her for \"pan de muerto\" [a sweet bread baked for the Day of the Dead] for the November celebrations. She says that finally \"I feel fulfilled, happy and grateful to God for all that He's given me. Likewise I am grateful to the people who have made it possible for us to reach our dreams.\"<br \/><br \/>* The photograph was taken on one of the downtown streets.

Her elder son has been providing transport facilities by driving a taxi for 7 years.  He needs to do maintenance on his taxi because it is not good and it requires more maintenance charges on a daily basis.

Anticipating a good harvest this season, Abdullahi has the opportunity to attain yields of up to 8 metric tonnes of maize per hectare of land, 5.5 times that of the average Nigerian maize farmer. <br \/><br \/>Before joining Babban Gona, Abdullahi would have had to sell his maize at harvest, a period when maize prices are at their lowest in the market, to meet his immediate cash needs such as food and clothing. Thanks to Babban Gona\u2019s support, Abdullahi can store his maize and sell it at a future date for up to 37% higher than the market price at harvest. <br \/><br \/>As a Babban Gona member, Abdullahi will benefit from marketing support that could see him generate earnings of up to $2000 per hectare of land. Abdullahi is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to ensure that all his children get a postsecondary education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2021604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-13T06:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-13T06:10:03Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdullahi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":21645.67,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":21645.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-23T14:45:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":973895,"name":"Inobatkhon","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"    \u0418\u043d\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0442\u0445\u043e\u043d 64 \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0441 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0411\u043e\u0445\u0442\u0430\u0440. \u0418\u043d\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0442\u0445\u043e\u043d \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0441 \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0439. \u0412\u043d\u0443\u0447\u043a\u0435 19 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0414\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434 \u0432 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044e \u0432 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0418\u043d\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0442\u0445\u043e\u043d, \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0448\u044c\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043e\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443. \u0412 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0435, \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0447\u043a\u0430. \u0418\u043d\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0442\u0445\u043e\u043d \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0442\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0435\u043c\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0447\u043a\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0443\u043d\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0435\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0442.","en":"Inobatkhon is 64 years old and a resident of a small district in Tajikistan, the Bohtar district.
