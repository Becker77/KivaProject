With Babban Gona\u2019s support, Usman will store the maize he harvests and delay its sale until a date later in the season, when he can obtain a significantly higher price for his maize at a premium up to 37% more than the harvest price. <br \/><br \/>With the opportunity to earn up to $2,000 per hectare of land, Usman now has the opportunity to actualize his dream to grow his agriculture business for himself and his family members, and would like to use this additional income to move to the city with his family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2021867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating the pressure to sell his maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-13T15:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-13T15:10:04Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Usman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":16482.74,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":16482.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-20T13:39:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":977086,"name":"Charles","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charles used the previous loan to buy sugar, salt, soap, and other household items to sell in his shop.

It is a quiet town and its inhabitants are hardworking people who work raising animals and also cultivating corn, a product consumed since pre columbian times. These characteristics are shared by Joaquin and by his family, comprised by his wife Alicia and their four children, three of whom are studying. In order to support his household, he decided to continue with the activity taught by his father: to provide taxi services. At the beginning, he was only using the car belonging to his father, but later on, thanks to his effort and savings, he was able to acquire his own car; and he currently has one more car, used by another person he employs native of his community. Nowadays, he has regular customers who personally require his services because they already know him for his kindness, professionalism and fair price. One of his future goals is to continue working so he can purchase more units that can give service to people in other communities. Also, the idea of providing work for enterprising people make him very happy because it reminds him of his own path that gradually led to success.

Mustapha is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family, and looks forward to using his additional earnings to diversify his farm and grow other crops."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2023661,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating the pressure to sell his maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-13T20:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-13T20:50:06Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mustapha","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":10260.31,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":10260.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-14T05:17:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":976959,"name":"Imane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Imane is a 28-year-old owner of a clothes shop located in Beirut, her hometown.

Nasiru is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2022151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-13T21:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-13T21:30:05Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nasiru","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":12942.61,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":12942.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-16T06:21:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey","image":713929}},{"id":977365,"name":"Mercy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercy is a hardworking entrepreneur who has a motorcycle transport business in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nShe is borrowing PHP 20000 through NWTF to purchase additional spare parts for the maintenance of her motorcycle transport business.\r\n\r\nMercy has been in this business for 3 years.

Basically, sari-sari stores can be found in all barangays, municipalities, and even in cities. Products there are cheap.  For only P1.00 you can buy a piece of candy or other sweet, compared to supermarkets where most products are being sold at wholesale.

Melanie has children in school and wants to continually support them with their expenses.  She wants to take advantage of the support CCT offers not just monetarily, but also in seminars and lectures for new entrepreneurs. She decided to apply for a loan of PHP 20, 000 as she wants to have revolving funds to run the business and add grocery items.\r\n\r\nMelanie has been consistent in attending CCT fellowship group that consists of 15 to 30 members where she hears the word of God and testimonies from partners.

For the past 13 years she has been selling household items, especially electrical appliances, dishcloths, and knifes.  She currently feels very satisfied now that the business has seen favorable profits all year long.  In addition to street vending where she generally makes greater earnings, she also has a shop in the city square.

Currently, Steve uses the revenue generated from his Zoona business to take care of wife and child, but it is barely enough for him to expand and that is why he needs to take a Kiva loan. <br \/><br \/>With this loan, Steve will be able to have the working capital float required for him to open another mobile money transfer outlet. By opening a new outlet Steve would not only save his community member\u2019s time, but it would also lower their expenses as this would reduce the need to travel long distances in order to send and receive money, which in a town as small as Itezhi-Tezhi would have a massive impact.

She\u2019s hoping that this year's loan will once again be granted by CCT.<br \/><br \/>Gloria regularly meets with her co-fellowship members to share her life\u2019s testimony, discuss her business experiences, draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship, and listen to the Word of God. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 members.

Her mother tongue is Aymara and she speaks Spanish. She shares her life with her mother and her siblings who work in trade. They live in a house, a family property, built of brick which has potable water, electricity, and sewerage. <br \/><br \/>Her business is the street selling of tools like screwdrivers, wrenches, hammers, boxes, and others, an occupation that she began with the help of her mother a decade ago. \"On Thursdays and Sundays I sell at the fair; the other days I look for commercial areas...\", she says. Her business's advantage is that with the help of her family, she could get a small working capital; the disadvantage is the lack of goods and the demand for some brands.

She is from the Talas region of Kyrgyzstan and came to Bishkek to get higher education. <br \/><br \/>She lives with her big family in a small village. Her family members are her parents, her elder brother with his wife and two sons, her elder sister and herself. <br \/><br \/>Like many villagers, Saikal\u2019s parents are farmers. They have a cow to milk and a horse for farming. It is evident that the village life is always hard and it gets harder when there are more members of family, especially little children, who need diapers, vitamins, etc. What the family grows, they eat, and if any is left, they try to sell it and earn money.<br \/><br \/>Saikal's elder sister is also a university student, but she studies in Talas, as it is hard even to support Saikal\u2019s study in the capital.

All the adults speak 100% their original native language, while younger people speak one of the five varieties that have arisen. The majority of the local people hold conversations in their native tongue, and if they learn Spanish, it is to pass on their couture and for work.<br \/><br \/>The name of the group was chosen because the majority of the streets are steep (loma means hill). It should be mentioned that adrenalin results from climbing the steep slopes, and very few people dare to drive their vehicles fast on the streets.<br \/><br \/>The group members are \u00c1ngel, Eugenia, and Cenobia who earn their living from fishing; Guadalupe embroidery; Claudia selling groceries; Magdalena, Irma and Lucia selling cosmetics; Evelia pastries and traditional food; Jeny and Ana selling meals; and Marcelino is a mechanic.<br \/><br \/>Evelia has two children who are still at school and are dependent financially on her and her husband. Her sole motivation in life is to see her children get good jobs since they have opportunities that she didn't have when she was young.<br \/><br \/>Eve (her nickname) says that she wants to progress and get ahead. For ten years she earned her living making and selling food and pastries. Later she took courses given in her locality and became a specialist in these foods. She notes that everyone has to work; money doesn't just come from the sky. So every morning she gets up early so she is completely organized by the time her first customers arrive.<br \/><br \/>Evelina plans to use the loan money to buy milk, eggs, gelatine, yoghurt, flour, yeast, butter, oil, meat, and tortillas.

She is the one wearing a red blouse.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2015489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy blouses, trousers, skirts, shirts,  shorts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tezonapa, Veracruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2015-11-14T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-14T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":3300,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Estefania ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Armando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elisa Janeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":55280,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":3455},{"due_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3455},{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":3455},{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3455},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3455},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":3455},{"due_date":"2015-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3455},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":3455},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3455},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3455},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":3455},{"due_date":"2016-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3455},{"due_date":"2016-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3455},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3455},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3455},{"due_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":3455}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-17T23:44:11Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Biebrich","image":2003312}},{"id":977597,"name":"Nore","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nore is 58 years old, married with six children.
