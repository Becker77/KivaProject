Despite all these circumstances, she remains strong. She continuously performs her daily tasks in her business in order to sustain her usual needs.<br \/><br \/>She grills barbecue beside her house located in Polomolok, South Cotabato. This is a favorite street food of many Filipinos. She has regular customers from the local community, her neighbors, students, and working people. She pays one helper to assist her in her business. Profits derived from her business sustain her and her helper\u2019s daily expenditures. <br \/><br \/>Estrella is planning to cook more barbecue to take advantage of the opening of the second semester in college. More students are expected to buy from her, and it will boost her income. This is why she prays for PHP 20,000 in additional capital that she will use to buy more ingredients for her barbecue stall. She humbly asks for your kind support that will serve as a great blessing to her.<br \/><br \/>Aside from her wish to enhance her business, Estrella has one primary dream -- that is to know exactly what happened to her son, to see and to be with him again if he\u2019s still alive, or to give him justice if he\u2019s already dead. <br \/><br \/>She gets inspiration from her co-fellowship* members at CCT who regularly meet every week to reflect on God\u2019s Words and share stories about life and their businesses. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She lives with three of her grandchildren aged between 15 and 7 years old. Mamatsoso lives in a traditional hut that is not well ventilated, nor warms up well in winter. Together with her eldest grandchild, she works long hours to ensure there is enough food for her family, some of whom are going to school and only help her in the field on Saturdays and Sundays. She has to wake up very early, between 4am and 5am, during the week to help start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water, and warming the house for all the children before they go to school. Collecting firewood, setting up the fire, and doing the actual cooking demands a lot of her time, which due to old age, she does not have. <br \/><br \/>Temperatures in the Lesotho highlands are never really high. Winters can get very cold, and often Mamatsoso has to start the fire inside her hut. Starting a fire releases smog and smoke, which when inhaled in large quantities over a period of time, can lead to lung diseases, eye problems, and in the worst case, death. In these circumstances, life for women like Mamatsoso is very difficult. <br \/><br \/>Mamatsoso has requested a loan from Kiva lenders in order to be able to purchase a clean cook stove, which will provide her and nine other people from her village who are living in similar circumstances, the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families, and that does not require expensive paraffin and gas, or a lot of wood, which is hard to find in Lesotho. This stove can be started with the use of very little readily-available biomass, like dry twigs and dry cow dung, that does not require lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the home. <br \/><br \/>This stove comes with a solar panel for charging a battery, which runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones and a mini LED lamp. It is a life-improving package for these women. This stove saves them time to be with their family, saves energy, eliminates toxic inhalation, gives them a better lit home to see in the evening while cooking and enables children to do their homework.

She is the mother of three children aged between 6 years and 9 months. She lives with her 30-year-old husband and her children. <br \/><br \/>Mateboho finds life life very difficult seeing that both she and her husband are unemployed and find means of living from piece jobs they find from time to time. nothing permanent. They live in a traditional hut that is not well ventilated, nor does it warm up well in winter. <br \/><br \/>Together with her husband, she works long hours to ensure there is enough food for her family, some of whom are going to school and only help her in the field on Saturdays and Sundays. She has to wake up very early, between 4am and 5am, during the week to start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water, and warming the house for all the children before they go to school. Collecting firewood, setting up the fire, and doing the actual cooking demands a lot of her time. <br \/><br \/>Temperatures in the Lesotho highlands are never really high. Winters can get very cold, and often Mateboho has to start the fire inside her hut. Starting a fire releases smog and smoke, which when inhaled in large quantities over a period of time can lead to lung diseases, eye problems, and in the worst case, death. In these circumstances, life for people like Mateboho is very difficult. <br \/><br \/>Mateboho has requested a loan from Kiva lenders in order to be able to purchase clean cook stoves, which will provide her and six other people from her village, who are living in similar circumstances, the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families, and that does not require expensive paraffin and gas, or a lot of wood, which is hard to find in Lesotho. This stove can be started with the use of very little readily-available biomass, like dry twigs and dry cow dung, that does not require lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the home. <br \/><br \/>This stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery, which runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones, and a mini LED lamp.

","en":"Alba is a 38 year old woman who considers the most important thing in her life to be her family. It is for them that she is seeking alternatives and opportunities to improve her business of aluminum and glass profiles. This business has supported them for the last three years. Her spouse worked for many years installing glass and aluminum protective casings, where he learned the trade. With some severance pay he received when he was laid off he opened the business with Alba, his right hand. They open the business every day at 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. and they do the work once the customer has paid for 50% of the service. Nonetheless, with the coming season, they will need a lot more raw materials to respond to the increase in demand. People take advantage of extra money they have to do enclosures, bathroom divisions, protective casings and sales. That is why Alba applied for a Kiva loan, an opportunity to connect to financing through the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She did this to buy different types and sizes of glass, aluminum, hinges, and more. In the future, she plans to expand their warehouse and have many more sales. For her personal life, they want to buy a house."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2018274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy different types and sizes of glass, aluminum, and hinges, and more.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-11-15T14:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-15T14:20:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alba Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":83801},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":94115},{"due_date":"2016-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":96938},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":99847},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":102842},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":105927},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":109105},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":112378},{"due_date":"2016-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":115750},{"due_date":"2016-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":119222},{"due_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":122799},{"due_date":"2016-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":137276}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.39},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.48},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.58},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.7},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.87},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.06},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.29},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.87},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-17T19:42:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":975814,"name":"Gilberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gilberto tiene 59 a\u00f1os  de edad, de estado civil casado vive con su esposa en un lugar alejado de la ciudad, se dedica a la comercializaci\u00f3n de frutas y verduras por m\u00e1s de cinco a\u00f1os esta es la \u00fanica fuente de ingresos con la que puede cubrir las principales necesidades del hogar.

So now his parents are so proud of him and trying to help him with his tuition fee.<br \/><br \/>Last year finishing school, Azamat was a finalist of full Scholarship for the AUCA\u2019s 1-year-study Preparatory Program, which allowed him to move to Bishkek city, live in the dormitory and have a stipend. During that year Azamat improved his English, learned how to think critically and logically and made a huge progress in his studies.<br \/><br \/>Becoming a freshman this year brought a new problem to Azamat, as this time he has to pay for his university degree by himself.

Zhyldyz has four children.<br \/><br \/>Zhyldyz is a very good, hardworking and purposeful woman. Her husband works at a petrol station. Zhyldyz owns a two storey building in the center of the city, which she rents out as office space. The first floor has been empty since the summer, and Zhyldyz deicded to go into business herself and open a store for selling Turkish produced clothing. <br \/><br \/>Zhyldyz learned that there is an opportunity to get a preferential loan for starting a business at the bank \"Bai Tushum\". She took a course on \"financial literacy\", made calculations and assessed her future business. Since the premises are hers and she doesn't need to spend money on rent, the income from the business will be good - around 78,000 som (KGS) per month. Her first customers will be acquaintances and relatives. Zhyldyz already talked to them and they were interested. <br \/><br \/>Zhyldyz will order the first batch of clothing, and will gradually expand. After making calculations, she concluded that she needs a loan of 150,000 som (KGS). For the requested amount she will purchase the first batch of clothing. The future income from the business and an increase in assets will allow Zhyldyz to give her children a worthy upbringing and
