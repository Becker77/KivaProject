Tahmina has a secondary education. For four years, she has been raising crops and livestock. Thanks to hard work and determination, Tahmina currently has 0.64 hectares of her own land, where she annually grows potatoes and corn for internal consumption and for sale, and she has a fruit garden. Also on her homestead, she has eight cows and a horse.

As most households in the Phillipines don't own a vacuum, people will use a soft broom instead to sweep the floors. <br \/><br \/>She is asking for a loan to buy more fiber and bamboos to be used in making soft brooms. This means more production once her materials are ready. Joan hope to expand her business and earn more to have a better income so she can buy what her children need."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2020829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to buy fiber and bamboo poles.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Badian, Cebu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":125,"posted_date":"2015-11-15T21:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-15T21:10:03Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2016-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":454.55},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":454.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.23},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.23},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.23},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.23},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.23},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.23},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.23},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.23},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.23},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.23},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.23},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.23},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.23},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.22},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.22},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.22},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.22},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.22},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":10.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-16T09:58:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":978029,"name":"Eugenia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"56-year-old Eugenia engages in cosmetology services.

She is 54 and a family woman who lives in the Shahrituz region with her sons, her daughter-in-law and her three grandchildren. Her sons work in agriculture and animal husbandry. Sharofat is a good grandmother and has three little grandchildren aged five, two and one. She loves her family very much.\r\n\r\nSharofat has been working in agriculture for more than 20 years. She is a serious and responsible woman. She plants various kinds of melon with the help of her sons, who are her primary helpers.

adult daughter who has her own children. She has a partial university education and works in animal husbandry and agriculture. She has sore legs, and so her grandson helps her with everything around the farm.

Yahaya is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2023591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-16T02:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-16T02:00:02Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#SustainableAg"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yahaya","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":13630.84,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":13630.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-16T07:25:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JenniferN"}},{"id":978190,"name":"Liana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Liana is 37 years old and she lives in the Tsovagyugh village of the Gegharkunik region.

","en":"Mar\u00eda is a 51 year-old entrepreneur who lives in a neighborhood in the town of Soledad. She is a mother of four children who are 29, 27, 22, and 11 years old. Along with her husband, she started her fast food and liquor shop when she felt that her family had a lot of unmet needs. The salary her husband earns as an employee at a private business wasn\u2019t enough to cover all the household expenses and they always found themselves with a thousand problems preventing them from having the funds they needed. \r\n\r\nSince Mar\u00eda started her business, things have changed and the family enjoys benefits they previously couldn\u2019t obtain. Every day of the week, she is ready to receive clients wanting to enjoy some fast food or have a soft drink or alcoholic drink with their friends and family. \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda applied for a loan, a Kiva loan, which was an opportunity her to become involved in the financial services of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, in order to stock her business with national and international brands of liquors, soft drinks, beers, and ingredients for preparing fast foods, such as chicken, beef, cold cuts, breads, sauces, and dressings. Mar\u00eda continues working hard so her family can have improved well being. With her business and the new financing, she believes she will go far.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2021046,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to buy national and international brands of liquors, soft drinks, beers, and ingredients for preparing fast foods, such as chicken, beef, cold cuts, breads, sauces, and dressings.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Soledad (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-11-16T03:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-16T03:40:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":199386},{"due_date":"2016-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":217368},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":223889},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":230605},{"due_date":"2016-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":237523},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":244649},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":251989},{"due_date":"2016-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":259548},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":267335},{"due_date":"2016-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":275355},{"due_date":"2016-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":283615},{"due_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":308738}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.78},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.08},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.36},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.71},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.13},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.63},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.2},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.84},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.57},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.37},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.27},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":976564,"name":"Te\u00f3dulo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Te\u00f3dulo, de 79 a\u00f1os de edad, no fue a la escuela porque sus padres no ten\u00edan recursos econ\u00f3micos suficientes porque eran pobres, est\u00e1 soltero y tiene 5 hijos de los cuales dos de ellos viven con \u00e9l, uno estudia y el otro trabaja con \u00e9l en la agricultura.  \n\nTe\u00f3dulo, toda su vida se ha dedicado a la siembra de granos b\u00e1sicos y al manejo de ganado,  todo eso lo aprendi\u00f3 gracias a sus padres quienes siempre se dedicaron a lo mismo; actualmente siembra casi 28,000 metros cuadrados de maicillo y 7,000 metros cuadrados de ma\u00edz, porque ya tiene terreno propio.\n\nTe\u00f3dulo, necesita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar pastaje para el ganado, porque debido a las perdidas de cultivo, no tiene suficiente alimento para darle a su ganado y tiene que comprarlo. \n\nEl principal sue\u00f1o de Te\u00f3dulo, es ayudar a sus hijos para que estudien y sean profesionales.  \n","en":"Te\u00f3dulo, 79, did not attend school because his parents did not have sufficient financial resources since they were poor.

Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has two cows and six sheep on her farm.  She also grows corn, wheat, and clover for resale on three hectares of land.  Her activity brings her a monthly income of about 11,000 som (KGS), which is not enough for a decent standard of living.  For this reason, Orunkul has turned to Kiva's partner, Bai Tushum Bank, and requested a loan of 140,000 som (KGS) to buy three steers and five sheep, which will increase her livestock headcount.

With Babban Gona\u2019s support, Sunday can now store his maize and sell it in the future for up to 37% higher than the market price at harvest time.\r\n\r\nSunday is grateful to be part of the Babban Gona family and in the end, hopes to use his increased earnings to ensure that all his children get a post-secondary education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1961835,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating the pressure to sell his maize for low prices at harvest time.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-16T11:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-16T11:20:03Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sunday","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":11784.71,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":11784.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-17T15:17:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Lush","image":null}},{"id":978274,"name":"Zhulieta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zhulieta lives with her daughter in Sevan city, Gegharkunik region.

She is wearing a black, sleeveless top.)  Her native tongue is Guaran\u00ed, and she speaks Spanish for business.  She shares her life with her life partner, who works as a builder, and with her children, who go to school.  They live in rented quarters made of brick.  They have running water, electricity, and indoor plumbing.<br \/><br \/>Her wish to improve her business took her to lead a communal bank.  The businesses of the members are a locksmith, a tire business, selling natural products for good health, making sheets, selling food, selling dairy products, and a fruit business.  Her business is selling bread and empanadas.  The empanadas are baked, made from a flour dough, and filled with beef or chicken in addition to potatoes and vegetables.  They are also filled with cheese.  They have chili peppers and are very popular in mid-morning.  \"Every day all of the bread and empanadas are sold out,\" she says. <br \/><br \/>The advantage of her business is that sales are daily, and she sells all of her production.  The disadvantage is the lack of flour.  Her dream is to open a snack bar.  <br \/><br \/>She wishes to buy flour by the 'quintal' [approximately 100 pounds] in order to have raw material for her work.   This is the first loan cycle with the institution in the one year she has been engaged in this business.

They live in the community of Yoxaja. <br \/><br \/><br \/>Manuela (the first on the left in the photo) in her eagerness to get income and get her family ahead works growing coffee.

Ajara has been doing this business for the past 13 years and this is how she assists her husband to cater to their children\u2019s education and other expenses.   As a serious business-minded person, she decided to include Elsa stove distribution in her business after she witnessed its demonstration and climate change education by the field officers in her community. Ajara has already surveyed the market for the stove that uses palm kernel shells (virgin pellets), which is a commonly known waste material within her surrounding communities. There is a high demand for the Elsa stoves since the fuel cost is zero. Additionally, it improves indoor air quality and the health of the users. Ajara and her group member need a micro loan to buy more stoves to meet the demands of clients through their market assessment. Funding their loan will also mean reducing deforestation and put an end to the cutting down of trees for firewood and charcoal by the communities of the stove users.

Sereolipi is a small village in Samburu County in Northern Kenya. Traditionally, the village is pastoralist, but recently it has been developing to have more retail shops and businesses. It is 65 kilometers from the national electricity grid, meaning it is unlikely to be connected anytime soon. Dhadho currently has a solar home system and a diesel generator to operate his business. The solar does not provide enough energy and the diesel generator produces toxic fumes and noise that are unhealthy and unpleasant for Dhadho and his customers. Furthermore, his generator is unreliable and breaks often, forcing him to close his business and lose revenue.<br \/><br \/>A new solar micro-grid has just been installed in Sereolipi. The micro-grid will replace the kerosene lanterns and diesel generators that residents currently use to meet their energy needs. It will offer constant, reliable, and clean energy. With his connection to electricity, Dhadho plans to expand his business by offering more salon services and a cyber caf\u00e9. Dhadho has five children, all currently in school. With his additional income and savings on energy expenditure, he will have more money for school fees for his children.<br \/><br \/>In additional to Dhadho, 25 other home and business owners will connect to the solar micro-grid. The micro-grid will allow them to keep their businesses open later with improved lighting and increase their standard of living with electrical appliances like refrigerators.

Yakubu is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2023969,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-16T20:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-16T20:20:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yakubu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":36584,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":36584}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":978584,"name":"Madalitso Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alice is 44 years old.
