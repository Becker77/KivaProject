The main challenge PowerMundo faces is the lack of access to capital and the financing needed for solar product inventory. With this support from lenders like you, PowerMundo will be able to purchase an additional 5,000 solar products over the next eighteen months, greatly increasing its inventory, allowing more products to be distributed by micro-entrepreneurs, and ultimately improving the lives of remote customers through access to clean energy. \n\nOver 4 million Peruvians do not have access to electricity and must use candles, flashlights, and diesel lanterns to light their homes. As a result, many people suffer from burns and respiratory illnesses, and face high energy costs and limited productivity - all of which perpetuate a cycle of poverty. \n\nOver the last 3 years, Paul, PowerMundo\u2019s General Manager, has led a team to develop a clean energy distribution network throughout Peru by working with existing local businesses and traveling sales agents who can efficiently reach remote customers, increasing their access to energy. PowerMundo trains and empowers Peruvian distributors with marketing and digital pay-as-you-go financing tools, allowing them to develop successful businesses that help people in rural communities save money, live healthier lives, and improve the environment.\n\nPowerMundo\u2019s impact is three-fold. First, the distributors trained by PowerMundo develop successful businesses that enable them to increase their income and thus better support their families. Second, the end-users gain access to clean energy, saving money and living healthier, more productive lives. For each solar lamp, end-users benefit from approximately 4 additional hours per night of improved lighting for work and educational purposes and can charge their cell phones. A family can save more than US$900 over 5 years by using a solar light instead of spending an average of $16 per month on other energy sources. Third, solar lights improve the environment; for each solar light, over 430 liters of diesel fuel and over 1,600 kgs of CO2 emissions will be replaced by clean energy. \n\nOne of PowerMundo\u2019s successful distributors is Diana who, with her husband, runs a basic necessities store in the town of Yurimaguas in the Loreto Region of Peru. Through this store, Diana supplies a small network of shops in the nearby rural communities. Seeing huge demand for improved lighting services, Diana received training from PowerMundo on the use and benefits of solar products, and she purchased an initial stock of 10 solar lights. With access to PowerMundo\u2019s product inventory, marketing support, and business training, she gradually built up her business; within two years, Diana has expanded her distribution network to other areas of Loreto and now purchases over 150 solar lights per month. With the additional income that she earns from selling the solar products, Diana and her husband were able to move to Tarapoto, a larger city, where they can provide better schooling for their child and develop additional business opportunities. After seeing the benefits for both her family and her customers, Diana decided to grow her network and began to help other distributors start their own clean energy businesses; she now works with more than 15 distributors to reach rural, off-grid customers. PowerMundo\u2019s sales have grown by an average of 150% annually for the past 3 years, leading to greater socioeconomic, health, and environmental impact through partners like Diana. \n\n\nThank you for contributing to help PowerMundo increase its positive impact in Peru!\n\n***\nThis loan is going through a Private Fundraising Period. During this period, the Field Partner and borrower are allowed to tap into their own networks to recruit support of the loan, prior to the loan being posted to the public Kiva website.\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":30000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2006111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Wholesale","sector":"Wholesale","themes":["Green"],"use":"to purchase approximately 5,000 units of solar products, primarily small solar lamps with charging capabilities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima y San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":408,"posted_date":"2015-11-04T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-16T22:10:05Z","loan_amount":30000,"lender_count":943,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Unique"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":30000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2016-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2017-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2017-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":16000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":4000},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-18T13:25:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":978594,"name":"Althea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Althea has a strong background in fashion design.

Previously she has made all her products herself, but in an effort to scale the business she will be supplementing her handmade goods with the inventory she will purchase."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2024125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase inventory to sell through her website","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"San Diego","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":249,"posted_date":"2015-11-16T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-16T22:20:02Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Althea ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":69.31},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":71.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":71.46},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":72.56},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":75.36},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":74.82},{"due_date":"2016-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":76.73},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":77.14},{"due_date":"2016-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":79.01},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":79.52},{"due_date":"2016-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":80.74},{"due_date":"2016-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":82.55},{"due_date":"2016-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83.23},{"due_date":"2016-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2017-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":85.81},{"due_date":"2017-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":87.12},{"due_date":"2017-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":89.56},{"due_date":"2017-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":89.82},{"due_date":"2017-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":91.47},{"due_date":"2017-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":92.59},{"due_date":"2017-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":94.2},{"due_date":"2017-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":95.45},{"due_date":"2017-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96.91},{"due_date":"2017-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":98.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.31},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.46},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.56},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.36},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.82},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.73},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.14},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.01},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.52},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.74},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.55},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.23},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.81},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.12},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.56},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.82},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.47},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.59},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.2},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.45},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.91},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-10T22:56:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nancy Kreml","image":1186147}},{"id":978684,"name":"Arzu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Arzu is 32 years old.

He is more familiar with the local area and knows the peoples' needs and demands. <br \/><br \/>In Azerbaijan, people consume a lot of wheat just like rural area people do, and they bake their own bread and make pastries and cakes at home. Royal has an advantage, because people know him as an honest person, who sells natural wheat. Currently, he is planning to buy more fertilizers, for which he needs 1200 AZN. Hopefully Kiva lenders will support him."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2024357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy more fertilizers to grow more fruits and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Bilasuvar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.5 48.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2015-11-17T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-17T00:40:02Z","loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Refugee"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Royal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2016-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2017-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2017-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2017-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2017-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2017-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":66.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.9},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.9},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.9},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.89},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mindy D","image":1196705}},{"id":978704,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali is 42 years old.

She carries out her business in the neighborhood \"Plan 3000,\" characterized as being the production center of the city where there are microbusinesses from areas like sewing and design as well as handicrafts. They reproduce foreign products that are sold in the main local markets. It is the most populated neighborhood in the city.<br \/><br \/>Lorena is of dark complexion, with long black hair that she ties at the nape of her neck, and is short in stature.

She shares her life with her husband who works as a bus driver and with her children who are in school. They live in their own home made of bricks and cement that has potable water, electricity, and a sewage system. <br \/><br \/>The desire to improve her business led her to lead the communal bank. The businesses of the members are: the sale of ice creams, the production of sheets, a hair salon, the sale of food, the sale of natural health products, the sale of secondhand clothing, and a repair shop for electrical appliances. Her business is the sale of baked goods. She has a kitchen that has a small oven where she bakes traditional pastries like cu\u00f1ap\u00e9 (a small sweet bun made with flour and yuca with cheese,) rice empanada (baked from rice and cheese,) wheat bizcochos (hard sweet buns made from wheat flour,) and others. <br \/><br \/>\"I have a small, old kitchen with which I started my business.

Thanks for being a great blessing to Geralyn. With your previous financial support, she has strengthened her buy-and-sell of tarpaulin covers and shoelaces resulting in a more profitable source of income. Also with that, she was able to add reusable shopping bags or tote bags which are in demand nowadays because of the intensive campaign to lessen the use of plastic bags. Plastic bags do not decompose easily, block the waterways, and cause flooding in the cities. These reusable shopping bags are intended to replace plastic bags.\r\n\r\nOnce again, Geralyn would like to ask your help. She's borrowing PHP 15,000 that will buy her a sufficient quantity of shopping bags in time for the Christmas season. More tarpaulin covers and shoelaces will also be added to her inventory. She hopes that you will trust her again because she has proven once that she's faithful in repaying. \r\n\r\nGeralyn aims to have a permanent place for her business.

With Babban Gona\u2019s support, Ummaru can store his maize and sell it in the future for up to 37% higher than the market price at harvest. <br \/><br \/>Ummaru is grateful to be part of the Babban Gona family and in the end hopes to use his increased earnings to  build a house for his family"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2024774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-17T05:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-17T05:40:03Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ummaru ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":20603.42,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":20603.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-18T14:44:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Morena Calvo","image":1832928}},{"id":978885,"name":"Faatoe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faatoe is a 46-year-old mother with two children.

Ismoil was not able to find a good job in his small district so, like many men, he thought about leaving his country to find work elsewhere.  However, he loves his wife and child very much and, for this reason, he is still in Tajikistan.\r\n\r\nIsmoil has decided to start his own animal husbandry business. Tajikistan enjoys a beautiful climate, which is very favorable to raising livestock and conducive to the healthy growth and breeding of domestic animals.

With the opportunity to earn up to $2000 per Hectare of land, Yusufa hopes to realize better yields and plans on using his  additional income to build a house for his family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2024785,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-17T10:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-17T10:50:04Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yusufa ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":17318.52,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":17318.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-17T15:04:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maadhavi Ramanayake","image":null}},{"id":975985,"name":"Aliymahan","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0410\u043b\u0438\u0439\u043c\u0430\u0445\u0430\u043d, 61 \u0433\u043e\u0434, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0441\u044b\u043d. \u041e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0443 \u0410\u043b\u0438\u0439\u043c\u0430\u0445\u0430\u043d \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435. \u041f\u043e \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430. \u0412 \u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0443\u0436\u0435 7 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c. \u0412 \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c 2 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b \u0438 24 \u043e\u0432\u0446\u044b. \u041d\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044e 1,09 \u0413\u0430 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u044d\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0443\u044e \u043a\u0443\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0443 \u0438 \u043f\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0443. \u0414\u043b\u044f \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430, \u0410\u043b\u0438\u0439\u043c\u0430\u0445\u0430\u043d \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0432 \u0411\u0430\u043d\u043a \u00ab\u0411\u0430\u0439 - \u0422\u0443\u0448\u0443\u043c\u00bb \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0432 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0435 50,000 \u0441\u043e\u043c (KGS) \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0443 7 \u044f\u0433\u043d\u044f\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0438. \u041d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u044b\u043b\u044c \u043e\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0438\u0439\u043c\u0430\u0445\u0430\u043d \u0438 \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e.

Hillaria loves farming and has even nicknamed her cow, and she really takes good care of her dairy cows. <br \/><br \/>The Nkubu area has favorable conditions that favor horticulture farming: good soils, good climate, a good transport system and a ready market for horticulture products. Hillaria wants to take advantage of this and start horticultural farming. She is seeking a loan to buy seeds and start horticulture farming. <br \/><br \/>Through her improved income, she will be able to improve her living conditions and secure the future of her family. The financial benefits that Hillaria will reap are almost immediate, and hence she will be assured of a secure future.

Ole has a family with one child and lives in a small village in Rembang, the northern coast region of Central Java, Indonesia.<br \/><br \/>Ole strives to improve his family's economic conditions. He has a few cows to fatten and resell, and also runs a rice farming business. His business is going quite well. However, he was deeply concerned to see the high price and scarcity of non-renewable cooking gas and to see cow dung pollute their water canal. <br \/><br \/>After an introduction by Yayasan Rumah Energi (YRE) and At-Tayseer Foundation (a local educational foundation \u2013 biogas construction partner of YRE) about the household biogas (BIRU) program, Ole saw that biogas is the best solution for his problem. He saw an opportunity to reduce his dependence on non-renewable cooking gas and chemical fertilizers. He became more confident after he heard the testimony from members of Trapoh Group, which is also a Kiva borrower group. <br \/><br \/>In order to make it happen, Ole invited four of his farmer friends to establish a farmer group. He is keen to purchase a biodigester, but he does not have sufficient capital for it. A loan from Kiva will help him and the other farmer group members to make it possible.<br \/><br \/>Ole is optimistic that if he can build a biodigester, he can use the biogas for cooking, and bioslurry (biogas residue) as fertilizer for his plantation.

Their average age is 40 years old and the ladies have large families. <br \/><br \/>The President of the Trust Bank is Aura, who is 38 years old and has a weaving business. Her parents did not permit her to go to school since school was not necessary for girls. Instead, she stayed home and helped with the household chores. <br \/><br \/>However, this did not limit Aura because she had a vision of who she wanted to be. She is now a competent weaver of \u201ccortes\u201d (traditional wrap around skirts), and huipiles (ornately embroidered and woven traditional blouses). She also raises chickens and pigs. Aura is requesting a loan to buy various colors and textures of thread as well as more traditional clothing to sell. <br \/><br \/>A majority of the 22,000 clients of Friendship Bridge have had little or no formal education and are just like Aura. Non-formal education is the backbone of the \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d Program of the organization (loans + education).<br \/><br \/>Friendship Bridge is very pleased to collaborate with partners like KIVA to provide loans for these ladies.

They are used for resting and sitting. The first thing he does is cutting the straw to store it and dry it. Then, he puts it together and sews it by hand until it is solid and wide. \"I sell payasas in different sizes and measures. The ones made for one person are easier to sell, because they are also used for sitting...\" he says. The advantage is that the materials he uses are cheap, the disadvantage is that he lacks transport means for his mattresses. He dreams of having his own house.<br \/><br \/>Juan wants to buy a motorcycle to transport his mattresses to the place where he sells them. This is his first loan with the institution since he started his business one year ago.

He speaks Spanish for cultural reasons. He shares his life with her wife, who is a fisherwoman, and his children, who go to school and fish too. They own the house where they live, which is made of adobe, and is served with electricity and water from a well, but not with sewage.<br \/><br \/>He is a photographer.

The advantage is that people request his services for all kinds of social events, and that he has a second source of income, wich is fishing. The disadvantage is that he has to travel long distances throughout the plateau. He dreams of improving his house.<br \/><br \/>He wants to buy a camera.

They live in a home owned by the family that is built of brick and has electricity.  However, the home lacks potable water and has no sewer system.  \r\n\r\nHelen has a business selling supplies to make decorations, such as: colored ribbons, glitter, yarn in many colors, glue, and other products.   \"I've been selling from my post since I was 16 years old, because my grandmother died and I had to take over her business,\" she comments.  \r\n\r\nThe advantage of Helen's business is that it is located in a very commercial area, the disadvantage is that she sells in the open air, and so she has to endure the inclement weather.

Faith faces challenges in her work and would like to overcome them by fully utilizing the free space she has on her farm by keeping a good quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture and the price of milk has been going up recently, so Faith, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will raise, and has learned that she will not only get milk from the cow but also manure to boost the fertility of her farm. Selling the milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market and she will also sell to big dairy processing firms. Faith said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agriculture-based loans and their interest rate is low. She has also taken training from Juhudi Kilimo and learned that saving is a continuous process in many micro-finance institutions. She hopes that through the profit she earns she will be able to add value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-aged children."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2003792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality breed of dairy cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-11-17T17:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-17T17:10:02Z","loan_amount":800,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3440.65},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3541.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3644.69},{"due_date":"2016-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":3751.21},{"due_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3860.84},{"due_date":"2016-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3973.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4089.8},{"due_date":"2016-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4209.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4332.35},{"due_date":"2016-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4458.96},{"due_date":"2016-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4589.27},{"due_date":"2016-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4723.39},{"due_date":"2016-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4861.43},{"due_date":"2016-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":5003.53},{"due_date":"2017-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":5149.74},{"due_date":"2017-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":5300.24},{"due_date":"2017-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5455.14},{"due_date":"2017-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5614.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.41},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.45},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.51},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.61},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.74},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.9},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.09},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.32},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.59},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.89},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.04},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.5},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-18T09:03:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":967903,"name":"Alh.

She is a proud countrywoman who started practicing farming out of economic necessity. She learned the trade from her parents, and now she honors them by continuing it. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Chesoi, Kapsowar, which is in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. Veronicah is happily married and is blessed with a lovely family. <br \/><br \/>For the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming. She grows maize and vegetables, and she also keeps dairy cows. Veronicah has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with the challenge of delivering the produce in a timely manner to the market. This challenge has not made her give up and she states: \"I have to do something for my family.\" <br \/><br \/>Veronicah joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. <br \/><br \/>She requests a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Veronicah is from Chesoi, a remote village that has poor roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables and tomatoes) which require timely delivery to the market. This loan will help Veronicah to achieve her dream and reach her goals. <br \/><br \/>For women in Kenya, accessing a financial solution is an uphill battle, but Veronicah feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva that help women to gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Veronicah will never suffer losses due to delays in delivering produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. As a result, her income will increase. <br \/><br \/>Veronicah is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community, because she intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike and help with farm work. Veronicah will use the loan to improve her living conditions and assure her children of a secure future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2003951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a motorbike for timely delivery of farm produce to the market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kapsowar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-11-17T17:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-17T17:20:08Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronicah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4300.81},{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4426.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4555.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":4689.01},{"due_date":"2016-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4826.05},{"due_date":"2016-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":4967.09},{"due_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5112.25},{"due_date":"2016-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5261.66},{"due_date":"2016-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5415.43},{"due_date":"2016-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5573.7},{"due_date":"2016-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5736.59},{"due_date":"2016-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":5904.24},{"due_date":"2016-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":6076.79},{"due_date":"2016-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":6254.38},{"due_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":6437.17},{"due_date":"2017-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":6625.3},{"due_date":"2017-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":6818.92},{"due_date":"2017-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":7018.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.27},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.56},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.89},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.12},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.62},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.74},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.37},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.04},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.77},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.54},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.37},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.25},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.19},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-21T15:37:28Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":965034,"name":"Magdaline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Magdaline is an energetic smallholder farmer, a person who always has a smile drawn on her face.

This is Priscilla, a 45 year old farmer. She is an extraordinary woman with a great personality. At a time when many farmers in Kenya are abandoning dairy farming and agriculture owing to poor yield and low income, Priscilla, hailing from Kerugoya, is scripting a success story with her dairy farming. <br \/><br \/>She is a role model, a mentor, and an inspiration to many young farmers in her village because of her resilience despite personal challenges and her passion to support her four children as a primary caregiver. <br \/><br \/>For the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and her primary source of income has been growing maize, vegetables and tomatoes and keeping dairy cows. Priscilla has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. After she lost her formal job, the role of primary caregiver has been overwhelming because of the responsibility of feeding the whole family. <br \/><br \/>\u201cI have to do something for my family,\" she said. Priscilla is requesting a loan to buy an additional quality dairy cow and to build a modern dairy unit. The dairy cow that she plans to buy is not just an ordinary cow, but it\u2019s a quality breed of dairy cow that will be producing between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. This will immediately translate to more profits and increased income levels. <br \/><br \/>The profit from selling milk will be used in repaying the loan in full, and the extra income will be used to increase her business enterprise. Priscilla is visionary and she intends that in the near future, she will start adding value to her milk business through packaging the milk before selling it. <br \/><br \/>She will also start selling dairy products such as yogurt. An improved income level will assure her family of a secure future. By joining Juhudi Kilimo, which assists smallholder farmers, she will also benefit from free extension services and links to markets. <br \/><br \/>Priscilla believes that if women small-holder farmers had the same access to resources as large scale farmers, the number of the world's hungry could be reduced.<br \/><br \/>Priscilla has the mindset of a winner. She will put forth the maximum effort possible to get her family ahead, and in the future, enjoy an excellent quality of life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2005579,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy a quality dairy cow and build a modern dairy unit.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kerugoya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-11-17T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-17T18:00:03Z","loan_amount":1975,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Priscilla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":5866.11},{"due_date":"2015-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":6037.55},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":6213.99},{"due_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":6395.6},{"due_date":"2016-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":6582.51},{"due_date":"2016-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":6774.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":6972.88},{"due_date":"2016-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":7176.66},{"due_date":"2016-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":7386.4},{"due_date":"2016-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":7602.27},{"due_date":"2016-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":7824.44},{"due_date":"2016-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":8053.11},{"due_date":"2016-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":8288.47},{"due_date":"2016-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":8530.7},{"due_date":"2017-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":8780.01},{"due_date":"2017-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":9036.6},{"due_date":"2017-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":9300.7},{"due_date":"2017-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":9572.51},{"due_date":"2017-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":9852.27},{"due_date":"2017-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":10140.2},{"due_date":"2017-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":10436.55},{"due_date":"2017-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":10741.55},{"due_date":"2017-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":11055.48},{"due_date":"2017-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":11378.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.93},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.62},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.36},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.16},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.9},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.86},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.87},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.94},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.07},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.27},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.53},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.85},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.24},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.7},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.24},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.84},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.53},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.29},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.14},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.06},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.07},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.17},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-22T03:32:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":965300,"name":"Faith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fifty two year old Faith is happily married and together with her husband, they are blessed with three children. <br \/><br \/>For the past 15 years she has been involved in mixed farming and because of the immense knowledge she has in farming, farmers from their village and neighboring villages troop to her home to seek technical advice on the best farming techniques.

Because of the hardcore poverty in his village, Isaac started practicing mixed farming 10 years ago. His sources of income are vegetables, milk, and egg sales. However, these products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market. The Nkubu, Keena area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market; that is why Isaac is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike.

This is the sad story of Judith, a youthful 50-year-old, a wise farmer whose neighbors and fellow farmers respect her as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills near Kitale, in the northern Rift Valley region of Kenya. Judith\u2019s farming experience dates back to 2000.<br \/><br \/>Like many other farmers in the region, maize is a staple crop which she has been planting for as long as she can remember. She also does dairy farming. With time, the fertility of her land has started to dwindle and whenever she plants maize the yields go down with each cropping season. Judith has also been affected with weeds.

He is a role model, a mentor and an inspiration to many young farmers in his village because of his resilience despite personal challenges and his passion to support his children as a primary caregiver. <br \/><br \/>Kiva lenders, meet Joseph, the man credited with the success story of his farm. He is a loving husband and father to three children and has been farming for the past 10 years. <br \/><br \/>Joseph passionately loves dairy farming, and this can be attested to by the fact that he knows each of his cows individually, because he works with them twice a day, 365 days a year. He and his wife have even named one of them. His primary source of income has been milk, eggs, crops and some personal business that he engages in to make ends meet. <br \/><br \/>The income he makes from selling milk, eggs and crops is insufficient to meet his family's expenses, but he has still kept hope alive that he will improve it. He is seeking a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a quality dairy cow. <br \/><br \/>Juhudi Kilimo serves poor smallholder farmers in Kenya. This is a severely marginalized group with little access to financial services. By extending credit to the farmers, Juhudi helps them acquire assets like dairy cows, poultry, irrigation equipment, and greenhouses. <br \/><br \/>Through this loan from Kiva lenders, Joseph will buy not just an ordinary cow but a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 10 and 20 litres of milk a day. The additional milk will result in additional income and hence improved living conditions. <br \/><br \/>The income generated from selling the milk will be used to fully repay the loan and will also go toward the education of his children. He will also benefit from the cow manure, which will be used to increase the fertility level of his farm, hence increasing productivity. Through the loan, he will also be able to build a bio-gas digester that will be helpful in saving energy. <br \/><br \/>This loan will completely change his life and improve his living conditions.

She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kathita Nkubu, which is in the central region of Kenya. Julia is happily married and is blessed with a lovely family. For the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming and she grows maize and vegetables. She also has dairy cows. Julia has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with the challenge of delivering the produce in a timely manner to the market. This challenge has not made her give up and she states: \u201cI have to do something for my family.\u201c Julia joined Juhudi Kilimo which is a micro finance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She requests a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Julia is from a remote village(Kathita) that has poor roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables, and tomatoes) which require timely delivery to the market. This loan will help Julia to achieve her dream and reach her goals. Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Julia feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help women to gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. The benefits of this loan are astronomical because Julia will never suffer losses due to delay in delivering produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. Her income will increase. Julia is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike and help with farm work. Julia will use the loan to improve her living conditions and assure her 3 children of a secure future."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2006853,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a farm vehicle to transport products to market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-11-17T20:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-17T20:00:03Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4300.81},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4426.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4555.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4689.01},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4826.05},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4967.09},{"due_date":"2016-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5112.25},{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5261.66},{"due_date":"2016-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5415.43},{"due_date":"2016-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5573.7},{"due_date":"2016-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5736.59},{"due_date":"2016-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":5904.24},{"due_date":"2016-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":6076.79},{"due_date":"2016-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":6254.38},{"due_date":"2017-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":6437.17},{"due_date":"2017-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":6625.3},{"due_date":"2017-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":6818.92},{"due_date":"2017-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":7018.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.01},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.27},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.56},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.89},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.26},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.12},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.62},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.74},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.37},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.04},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.77},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.54},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.37},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.25},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.19},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-24T19:21:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Darcy Palmer","image":551286}},{"id":977211,"name":"Maria Josefina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda, es una mujer muy trabajadora y que gracias al apoyo proporcionado con el cr\u00e9dito anterior pudo capitalizar su negocio de atoles y manualidades, sus ventas han mejorado y la situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica de su familia va mejorando poco a poco.\nMar\u00eda nuevamente solicita un cr\u00e9dito para realizar la compra de materiales como: papel, list\u00f3n, cera y otros para la elaboraci\u00f3n de flores y coronas para vender en el d\u00eda de los difuntos, con esto Mar\u00eda considera que obtendr\u00e1 mayores ingresos y podr\u00e1 continuar dando una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica a su familia.\n","en":"Mar\u00eda is a very hard-working woman and thanks to the support provided by her previous loan could capitalize her business of handcrafts and \"atoles\" (hot beverages).

She is a rural farmer in Chuka, Kenya, an area known for having bad terrain and a lack of proper infrastructure. She is blessed with a lovely family and has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. On her farm, she grows maize and she raises a dairy goat, cow, and poultry. She sells milk, eggs, and maize. To meet her expenses and provide the best for her family, she often engages in small personal businesses to make extra money. However, farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction, despite meager earnings. Eusephia says, \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back for my products because it shows me that I am meeting their needs!\" Her biggest challenge is lack of capital. Because of this challenge, she formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports small rural farmers. She acquired a dairy goat. The goat produces milk daily, which Eusephia sells to a co-operative. The money Eusephia got from selling the milk was adequate to repay the loan. Today, Eusephia is seeking a new loan to buy another dairy goat because she is planning to become a full-fledged dairy goat farmer. With this loan, Eusephia is going to grow into a very successful dairy goat farmer. All she wants is for her family to enjoy the abundance of life, good health, and a good livelihood. Her only dream is to continue growing her business and in the future to leave it to her children. Eusephia patiently waits for your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2007089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality breed of dairy goat","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-11-17T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-17T20:20:02Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eusephia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2123.19},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2185.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2249.1},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2314.83},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2382.48},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2452.11},{"due_date":"2016-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2523.78},{"due_date":"2016-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2597.53},{"due_date":"2016-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2673.45},{"due_date":"2016-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2751.58},{"due_date":"2016-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2831.99},{"due_date":"2016-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2914.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.23},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.85},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.49},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.15},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.82},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.52},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.24},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.98},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.73},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.52},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.32},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-17T21:15:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Darcy Palmer","image":551286}},{"id":967402,"name":"Beatrice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatrice is a 52-year-old, charismatic young woman who is a strong example of hard work.
