She resides in Keanthu, a remote village in the lush hills of Chuka in the central area of Kenya. <br \/><br \/>As the key breadwinner of her family with three children, Nancy has been practicing mixed farming for the past ten years. Her primary source of income has been selling milk, eggs, and bananas. She also engages in a small business to supplement the meager income she earns through farming. Because of her immense farming knowledge, she commands a lot of respect from other farmers in her village. While she has been making a living from farming, she has identified a niche market for cereals. The only challenge she faces is a lack of funds. <br \/><br \/>Nancy is now requesting a 50,000 KES loan through Kiva's field partner Juhudi Kilimo to buy different varieties of cereals to sell in the local market. The market for cereals is never a problem because the demand is high, and she plans to take advantage of that. Because of the good relationship she has with her neighbors, she plans to increase her market share by using word of mouth to reach more customers and markets. <br \/><br \/>Nancy is an inspiration to many farmers in her village. Through accumulated profits she will then be able to buy a milling machine for grinding maize.

She knows how to overcome the problems that life presents and despite having few opportunities for paid work, she has never given up looking for ways to support herself. She started practicing mixed farming 10 years ago. Although she has only farmed for the past ten years, she is working hard and learning good farming practices. Through the profits she makes, she has been able to take care of her family and provide the basic needs for her parents. <br \/><br \/>Margaret lives near Chesoi in the Kapsowar area of Kenya, an area with good weather patterns and favorable weather conditions that support farming. Maize is a very common crop in Kenya and is a staple food for many who regularly eat \u201cugali,\u201c or hard porridge cooked from maize. One can usually buy sifted maize flour in the market, but its cost is higher because of the processing. Flour can be less expensive, however, if it is milled directly using a posho mill. The Chesoi area has only one diesel posho mill that serves a great number of people. The main problem here is that the posho mill keeps breaking down so farmers cannot grind their maize. <br \/><br \/>Margaret intends to change this by buying another posho mill to serve the area. She will buy an electric, rather than diesel, posho mill, as they are more reliable. Hopefully breakdowns will be few and far between. To accomplish this, Margaret is applying for a 100,000 KES loan through Juhudi Kilimo to buy a mill. <br \/><br \/>Profits derived from the mill will be used to comfortably repay the loan. In the next two years, Margaret sees herself established and running more than one posho mill. She patiently waits for your kindness.

She lives in a post-conflict zone, where there are not many employment opportunities. Born in Nyakoria, a rural village in Nyamira, she has lots of enthusiasm and is very resourceful. Since she was a little girl she has demonstrated her talent and knack for farming. <br \/><br \/>Nyakoria is a remote village in the Nyamira area of Kenya where people live in shanties. But within these shanties Esther is working hard to pull herself out of the dismal conditions. Most smallholder farmers view Esther as a role model and a mentor because of the resilience that she has despite personal challenges, and her passion to support her four children as a primary caregiver. <br \/><br \/>Esther started farming in 2007 after the country suffered post-election violence. With the unstinting support of her husband, who dedicated his one acre, she has grown the business dramatically. She has acquired numerous income-generating assets, including farm machines. She keeps dairy cattle and grows subsistence and commercial crops, such as maize and tea. She takes pride in being independent and being involved in a sector that feeds the population. <br \/><br \/>Esther is seeking a loan to buy farm implements such as modern farming tools and seeds.

She resides with her husband and family. She has been actively involved in farming for the last 5 years and has never regretted or looked back. She practices mixed farming and sells milk, eggs, and various food crops at the local market. She passionately loves poultry farming, but the biggest challenge she is facing is a lack of capital to buy quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs. \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan to purchase additional poultry. She believes the excess maize she has will be used in feeding the poultry, sorghum will be used in giving the poultry energy and green grams for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs that are of good quality, which will translate to more income. Apart from an increase in egg output, she will get increased output from poultry meat, and this will increase her income and profit margins.

Also, the area is quite famous for fields of cultivated flowers that enjoy huge popularity throughout the year but especially on Mother\u2019s Day and Saint\u2019s Days.

She is married with five children. Maria sells chicken meat by the pound not only in her own community but in nearby ones as well. She, along with her husband, is determined to work hard so that their children can go to school. Happily, she has been successful as three of them are about to finish high school. Maria is requesting a loan so that she can increase her inventory of chicken meat. She also wants to buy some chickens to raise and, in the future, she would like to sell eggs!<br \/><br \/>Maria and her friends in the Trust Bank look forward to their monthly meetings when they transact business on their loans and participate in educational trainings led by a Facilitator from Friendship Bridge. The ladies learn how to improve their lives and their businesses as they learn about empowerment and self-esteem, realizing goals, setting dreams, women\u2019s rights and violence against women. <br \/><br \/>Friendship Bridge serves over 22,000 indigenous women in mostly rural areas in Guatemala where the rate of poverty is the highest. Through loans and education (\u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d), the organization offers these women a chance for a more prosperous future for themselves, their families and their communities. <br \/><br \/>Thank you, Kiva lenders, for believing in these women and funding loans for them.

Meet Christine, who is a 38-year-old smallholder farmer from Ehoya farm Kitale area in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. Christine owns a 0.5 acre farm. On the farm, she practices mixed farming. This kind mother keeps dairy animals and grows a variety of crops and vegetables. She has 10 years of experience in farming. <br \/><br \/>Christine is seeking a loan to expand her horticultural farm. She is very hardworking and determined to increase her farm's output. Loans for smallholder farmers with little, irregular income and no solid collateral are hard to come by in Kenya. Few organizations such as Juhudi Kilimo support farmers like Christine. Through a group of 15 members called Muihwa, Christine has access to income-generating asset loans from Juhudi, which use the group-based savings as collateral. <br \/><br \/>According to Juhudi Kilimo, horticulture represents an opportunity for reducing poverty through income generation among smallholders, whether unskilled or semi-skilled. In the past, African women used to stay at home and look after the household.

However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming for the past ten years. <br \/><br \/>Annah has always had an affinity for farming.

Through the loan, she will be able to purchase high-quality seed, good fertilizer, and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production.

Meet Elijah, a hardworking, dedicated, and honest 53-year-old dairy farmer. As the key breadwinner of his family, with a wife and eight children, he farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Litein, in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. <br \/><br \/>For the past 15 years, he has been practicing mixed farming and his primary source of income has been milk, eggs, and maize selling. He also engages in a small business to supplement the meager income he earns through farming. Elijah passionately loves dairy farming but the biggest challenge he faces is feeding his cows and satisfying the largely unsatisfied milk market. <br \/><br \/>He is seeking a loan to buy a chaff cutter and another quality breed of dairy cow. The chaff cutter will assist Elijah in cutting hay into small pieces before being mixed with other forage to feed his cow. Also, it will aid the animal\u2019s digestion and prevent the animals from rejecting any part of their food. <br \/><br \/>Elijah also intends to buy not just an ordinary cow, but a quality breed of cow that will be producing between 15-25 litres of milk a day. Before Elijah joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance that supports smallholder farmers with technical and financial solutions, he considered dairy farming not a lucrative business. After training, Elijah now believes that dairy farming is the business to go into. <br \/><br \/>With the loan, Elijah will increase his income from milk selling and his cows will have more food to eat and never reject food. The key to high yield in milk production is proper feeding of the cows and through this loan, Elijah will achieve this. <br \/><br \/>An increase in income will allow Elijah to improve his living conditions and secure the future of his children.

She is blessed with 8 children who are her greatest motivators. She perseveres because she wants to provide a better future for them. Jane was unable to study for a professional career because of the economic situation in her family. However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming for the past 10 years. <br \/><br \/>Jane has always had an affinity for farming. She has even nicknamed one of her cows and is a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows. Her cows produce between 10 and 15 liters a day which helps her support her family. She also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming inputs. <br \/><br \/>That is why Jane is seeking a loan to buy farm inputs. Through this loan, she will be able to purchase high-quality seed, good fertilizer, and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production.

At age 51, she spends every day of the week, Monday through Sunday, in her mixed farm, tirelessly working. Mary is one of the most hardworking and dedicated mums on planet earth. She is based in Ntugi, a remote village in the Nkubu area of Kenya. She is happily married to Marete, who adds additional income to support their family. They are blessed with four lovely children. <br \/><br \/>For the past 10 years she has been engaged in mixed farming, and through selling milk, eggs and a variety of food crops she has earned a decent income. Like many farmers in her village, she also plants trees on her farm to complement the region's natural forests. Although Mary makes profits selling her farm produce at the market, the biggest challenge she faces is lack of water to irrigate her farm and water for home consumption. Mary comes from an area where there is no water connection and she is always forced to walk for a long distance for this \u201cprecious commodity.\" Mary faces challenges carrying water on her back because of her failing health. <br \/><br \/>Mary is seeking a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes. Most of the farmers in Kenya depend on rain-fed agriculture but Mary wants to change that notion and start irrigation farming. Through the loan she intends to harvest rain water (which always goes to waste) and store it in the tank. She intends to buy pipes that will be used to pump water from the river directly to her farm. With your loan, Mary will be saved the trouble of walking a long distance in search of water, and she will have enough water for home consumption. Irrigating her farm will boost productivity since water is an important requirement in the germination of crops. Mary is very excited about this project and hopes her dream will be achieved through the loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders. Increased productivity means increased income and this will translate to improved living standards. She will use the additional income to improve and secure the future of her children. Mary\u2019s hope for the future is to live a fulfilling life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2010494,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To purchase a water tank and water pipes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-11-18T00:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-18T00:20:03Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3538.64},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3642.06},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3748.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3858.05},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3970.8},{"due_date":"2016-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4086.84},{"due_date":"2016-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4206.28},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4329.21},{"due_date":"2016-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4455.73},{"due_date":"2016-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4585.95},{"due_date":"2016-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4719.98},{"due_date":"2016-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4857.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.39},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.42},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.48},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.58},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.71},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.87},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.06},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.29},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.56},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.86},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.2},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-22T06:01:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Benjamin","image":1467297}},{"id":968044,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The above picture presents Mary, a practical, intelligent, and ingenious woman.

Her primary sources of income have been from planting crops, milk, eggs and a variety of vegetables. She also engages in some personal business to make ends meet. <br \/><br \/>Mary passionately loves farming. She got interested in farming out of a desire to be a solution to food security, which remains a thorn in the flesh for all the farmers in Kitale and Africa as a whole. From farming, she has been able to earn a decent income and she attributes all this success to hard work and determination. Although she makes profits, she has always wanted to increase her farming and start a cereal-selling business. The main challenge she faces is lack of funds. <br \/><br \/>She is seeking a loan to buy cereal. Demand for cereal is overwhelming in Kitale and through this loan she will buy different varieties of cereal.

Sammy is from Litein, a remote town in Kenya, and is an active and progressive farmer in his locality. He has a wife and together they live on a small piece of land. <br \/><br \/>Traditionally, his primary source of income has been eggs, crops, a personal business, and he has been practicing farming for the past 10 years. Having done farming he has gained so much experience that he is always ranked the best farmer in his village. <br \/><br \/>Kenyans drink a lot of milk. This tradition is probably derived from tribal culture - particularly the Nandi tribe (Sammy\u2019s tribe) - where cows represent wealth. Demand for dairy milk has been high and Sammy wants to take advantage of the market. <br \/><br \/>Therefore, he is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow. Dairy farming is another profitable agricultural venture in Kenya and Sammy has already identified the breed of dairy cow that he wants. He has planted so many trees on his farm that food for the cattle will never be a problem. Marketing of the dairy milk and dairy products will not be a challenge, because he will sell the milk directly to the market and also to big dairy processing firms. <br \/><br \/>Through the loan, Sammy will not only benefit from milk, but will also benefit from manure (cow dung) that will be used in improving the fertility of his farm, thus saving money that would have been spent buying fertilizer. <br \/><br \/>Sammy has been facing challenges in accessing finances, but feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo, via Kiva, are there to make his dream come true. Sammy chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loan is low and is on a reducing basis. Sammy underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and during the training season, he learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. <br \/><br \/>Through accumulated profits, Sammy plans to permanently improve his living conditions and to secure the future of his school-aged children by paying tuition fees for them. He plans that through increased income, he will be able to buy more dairy cows and build a bio-gas digester, and hence save costs incurred in buying fuel."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2007945,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a quality breed of cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.583333 35.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-11-18T00:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-18T00:30:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sammy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2016-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5503.14},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":5829.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.46},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.7},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.3},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.65},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.95},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.64},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-10T23:06:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":969803,"name":"Files","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Files is a very hard-working and helpful mother who does all that she can for her family's benefit and well-being.

This is all because she wants to achieve her dream of giving her children a good education. Sabina is a very industrious, honest and hardworking woman from the Nandihills area of Kenya, near the famous Rift valley escarpments. Sabina has been farming for the past 10 years. Over the years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. She has been practicing mixed farming. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, maize, crops and some small business venture that help her make ends meet. Sabina is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. That is why, every day, she wakes up very early to go to her farm to plough. <br \/><br \/>Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Nandihills area, one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Sabina could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. Accessing funds has been a challenge for Sabina, but she now feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. <br \/><br \/>Sabina believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals.

Kiva lenders! Introducing to you Betty, a 24-year-old, youthful, very hardworking, honest, and ever-smiling farmer. She lives with her parents and siblings in a remote village in Litein in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. <br \/><br \/>Betty passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past five years and has always managed to provide for her parents and siblings. Feeding the large family requires a lot of hard work and determination. Her other sources of income are crops and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her family. In farming, she enjoys the returns she gets, but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. <br \/><br \/>Betty has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good-quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture, and the price of milk in the recent past has been going up, so Betty, being a visionary and entrepreneurial farmer, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she learned that she will not only get milk from the cow, but also manure; this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling the milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market, and she will also sell to big dairy processing firms. <br \/><br \/>Betty said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agriculture-based loans, and their interest rate is low and on a reducing basis. She underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, and from the training she learned that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions. Betty hopes that through the accumulated profit, she will be able to start adding value to her milk by starting services such as packaging and the production of other dairy products. <br \/><br \/>This loan will change her life and will secure the future of her school-going children.

Through the loan, Timothy will be assured of a bumper harvest, and this will translate into more profits and cash. Through the use of good seeds and fertilizer, he will increase his profit margins. Through this loan, Timothy will be able to expand his horticulture business. He sees a lot of room for improvement and growth. What is lacking is the funds. <br \/><br \/>With your loan, Timothy will make enough income to take care of his family and other farming expenses. He wakes up early and goes to sleep very late every day to give his family a decent living and afford his children a proper education."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2012269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farm implements","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-11-18T02:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-18T02:50:02Z","loan_amount":500,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Timothy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2150.41},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2213.26},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2277.94},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2344.51},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2413.03},{"due_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2483.55},{"due_date":"2016-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2556.13},{"due_date":"2016-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2630.83},{"due_date":"2016-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2707.72},{"due_date":"2016-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2786.85},{"due_date":"2016-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2868.3},{"due_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2952.12},{"due_date":"2016-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3038.4},{"due_date":"2016-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3127.2},{"due_date":"2017-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3218.59},{"due_date":"2017-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3312.65},{"due_date":"2017-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3409.4},{"due_date":"2017-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":3509.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.13},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.78},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.45},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.13},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.84},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.56},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.31},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.08},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.87},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.68},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.52},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.38},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.27},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.19},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.13},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":970899,"name":"Betty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Betty, who is 40 years old, is a charismatic young woman and a strong example of hard work.

With your $25 loan, this can be easily achieved. She will rely on other sources of income to make initial instalments of the loan, but in no time, the banana farm will start pumping in income.

She is a proud smallholder woman who started practicing farming out of economic necessity. She learned the trade from her parents, and now she honors them by continuing it. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kigogo, Chuka, which is in the central region of Kenya. Casty is happily married and is blessed with a lovely family. <br \/><br \/>For the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming. She grows maize and vegetables, and she also keeps dairy cows and goats. Casty has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with the challenge of delivering the produce in a timely manner to the market. This challenge has not made her give up and she states \"I have to do something for my two children.\" <br \/><br \/>Casty joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She requests a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Casty is from a remote village that has poor roads, and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables, and tomatoes) which require timely delivery to the market. This loan will help Casty to achieve her dream and reach her goals. <br \/><br \/>For smallholder women in Kenya, accessing a financial solution is tough, but Casty feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva that help women. The benefits of this loan are many and one of them is that Casty will never suffer losses due to delay in delivering produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market.

Meet Irene, a 38-year-old, youthful, very hardworking, honest, and ever-smiling mother. She lives with her husband in a remote village in Chuka, in the central region of Kenya. <br \/><br \/>Irene passionately loves farming. She has been farming for the past five years and has always managed to provide for her family. Feeding the large family she has requires a lot of hard work and determination. Her other sources of income are crops and some personal business that she does in order to provide food for her large family. In farming, she enjoys the returns she gets, but is challenged to maintain a good standard of living. <br \/><br \/>Irene has identified free space on her farm and wants to fully utilize this space by keeping a good-quality dairy cow. Dairy farming in Kenya is a very profitable venture. In the recent past, the price of milk has been going up, so Irene, being a visionary and entrepreneurial woman, wants to take full advantage of this. She has chosen the breed of cow that she will keep, and she learned that she will not only get milk from the cow, but also manure; this will boost the fertility of her farm. Selling the milk will never be a problem because there is a ready market, and she will also sell to big dairy processing firms. <br \/><br \/>Irene said she chose Juhudi Kilimo for this loan because they offer agriculture-based loans, and their interest rate is low and on a reducing basis.

Mildred is a youthful, 27-year-old farmer from Kwanza, a remote village in the Nandi Hills area of Kenya where people live in shanties. According to residents, the people of Kwanza are forgotten or ignored by the county government of Nandi Hills. But within the remote village of Kwanza, Mildred is working hard to pull herself out of the dismal conditions. Most smallholder farmers view Mildred as a role model and a mentor because of the resilience that she has despite personal challenges, and her passion to support her five children as a primary caregiver. <br \/><br \/>Mildred started farming in 2007 after the country suffered post-election violence. With the unstinting support of her husband, who dedicated his five acres, she has grown the business dramatically. She has acquired numerous income-generating assets, including farm machines. She keeps dairy cattle and grows subsistence and commercial crops, such as maize and beans. She takes so much pride in being independent, self-reliant and being involved in a sector that feeds the population of Kenya. <br \/><br \/>Mildred is seeking a loan to purchase more land. Her operations are growing consistently, eating up the available space. With your funding, Mildred will have more space to expand her business output. The money from the investment will be ploughed back into the business to finance even more growth.

Meet Asenath, a very hardworking, energetic and honest mum who is 47 years of age. She lives in the rich highlands of Chuka with her husband and four children. Asenath has been practicing farming for the past 15 years and, through those years, she has been able to support her family. Her primary sources of income are eggs, vegetables and crop farming. <br \/><br \/>The Chuka area is populated and has a ready market for poultry products. However, Asenath's biggest challenge is lack of funds, which is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy poultry. <br \/><br \/>Poultry farming is one of the profitable business ventures in Kenya and you don\u2019t need to be a large scale farmer to benefit from it. Through the loan, Asenath will be able to sell eggs, meat and poultry feathers to the already existing market. The demand for chicken is always high, being such a popular meal for many people as can be proved when you visit fast food joints in her area. <br \/><br \/>Asenath has been facing challenges accessing finances but she feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva are there to make her dream come true.

Meet Rose, a 37-year-old hardworking, honest, and dedicated farmer who lives in Lunyu, a remote village in Kitale. She is happily married and has four children. Rose has been practicing mixed farming for the last five years and has gained much experience. To provide a decent and comfortable life for her children, she has been selling milk, eggs, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. Like many farmers from her region, Rose finds poultry farming very enjoyable and she stated that the most enjoyable part about poultry farming is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d Her biggest business challenge is meeting demand, which is really high. Rose lacks funds to increase her poultry farm.\r\n\r\nRose is requesting a 10,000 KES loan to buy poultry. Her loan will help her to sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and the local market. This will translate into increased profit and an improved income level.

Meet Lizzy, a 25-year-old mother who is so humble, honest and a very hardworking mum on this planet Earth. Lizzy is a mother of one lovely child who she really adores so much and will always do anything good so that she never goes to bed with a hungry stomach. <br \/><br \/>Lizzy hails from the Kobos, Kitale area of Kenya. Lizzy never got the opportunity to advance her education and get a white collar job but this did not kill her dream of wanting to succeed in life. Lizzy started farming and has been farming for the past six years. Throughout those years, she has gathered so much experience and all the farming techniques are at her fingertips. Lizzy practices mixed farming on her farm. Through her profits, she has managed to take care of her family's needs and give her child a good education because she believes that education is the only \u201ckey to success\u201d. Lizzy is a mum who is very enterprising. <br \/><br \/>She is seeking a loan of 60,000 KES to buy seeds and start horticulture farming on her farm. Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in her village, good soil and a ready market for horticulture products, Lizzy wants to take advantage of these and reap more profits. <br \/><br \/>Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring mums, like Lizzy, to make their farming dreams come to reality through training and loan financing. <br \/><br \/>Lizzy hopes that through the loan, she will improve her living conditions. Lizzy\u2019s dreams and projections are that by the end of the first year, she will not only be selling in the local market but will also be selling in international markets through exporting fruits and vegetables.

Following the advice of a friend, she decided to build a banana-ripening facility. At the beginning, the amount of bananas she bought was limited due to the amount of available resources, and the number of customers she had was also small. But now, facing an increase in customer numbers, she needs to increase the number of bananas she buys in order to satisfy her customers' needs, which is why she is requesting these funds for procurement purposes. Her business also employs 3 people. Nearly all of the ripe banana resellers in her district get their supplies from

At age 46, she spends every day of the week, Monday through Sunday, tirelessly working on her mixed farm. <br \/><br \/>Violet is one of the most hard-working and dedicated women on planet earth. She is based in Kwanza, a remote village in the Nandi Hills area of Kenya. She is happily married to Anthony, who provides additional income to support their family. They are blessed with four lovely children. <br \/><br \/>For the past ten years, Violet has been engaged in mixed farming and, through selling milk, eggs, and a variety of food crops, she has earned a decent income. Like many farmers in her village, she also plants trees on her farm to complement the region's natural forests. <br \/><br \/>Although Violet makes profits selling her farm produce at the market, the biggest challenge she faces is lack of water to irrigate her farm and water for home consumption. Violet comes from an area where there is no water connection and she is always forced to walk for a long distance for this 'precious commodity.' Violet faces the challenge carrying water on her back because of her failing health. <br \/><br \/>Violet is seeking a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes. Most of the farmers in Kenya depend on rain-fed agriculture, but Violet wants to change that notion and start irrigation farming. Through the loan, she intends to harvest rain water (which always goes to waste) and store it in the tank. She intends to buy pipes that will be used to pump water from the river, directly to her farm. <br \/><br \/>With your loan, Violet will be saved the trouble of walking a long distance in search of water and she will have enough water for home consumption. Irrigating her farm will boost productivity since water is an important requirement in the germination of crops. <br \/><br \/>Violet is very excited about this project and hopes her dream will be achieved through the loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders. Increased productivity means increased income and this will translate to improved living standards. She will use the additional income to improve and secure the future of her children. Violet\u2019s hope for the future is to live a fulfilling life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2016280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a water tank and water pipes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-11-18T16:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-18T16:00:02Z","loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Violet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2016-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2016-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2016-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2016-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2016-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2016-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2016-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2016-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5503.14},{"due_date":"2016-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":5829.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.46},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.7},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.3},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.65},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.04},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.48},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.95},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.64},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-18T23:10:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Eric Saltmarsh","image":1210811}},{"id":976424,"name":"Aminata's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce groupe  a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en place en Octobre 2015.

They joined their hands in improving their farm to create financial strength for the home that they share. She is happily married and has been practicing mixed farming for the last five years and has gained so much experience. To afford a decent and comfortable life for her two children, she has been selling bananas, milk, and varieties of food crops from her farmland. <br \/><br \/>The Igoki, Nkubu area is very populated, and the demand for banana products is very high. Like many farmers from her region, she finds banana farming very enjoyable. She stated that what she likes best is \u201cthe increased profits I enjoy.\u201d <br \/><br \/>Her biggest challenge, however, is meeting the demand, which is really high. She lacks funds to increase her banana farming, and she is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES to buy more banana seedlings to plant.

Linety has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. Although she has made profits selling a variety of food crops, she is faced with the challenge of timely delivery of produce to the market. This challenge has not made her give up; \u201cI have to do something for my family,\u201c she said. Linety mobilized other woman in her village and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that helps aspiring women like her. She is requesting a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. <br \/><br \/>Linety is from a remote village that has poor feeder roads, and transporting her produce to market has been a challenge, which is why she has suffered so many losses.

Accessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle but Linety feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva that help women so that they can gain respect and equality. The benefits of this loan are big because Linety will never suffer losses due to delay in delivery of produce to the market and also, she will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. She is a woman who is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone who will be riding the motorbike and helping in farm work.

She passionately loves poultry farming. When asked what is most enjoyable about poultry farming, her response was \u201cfeeding my poultry.\u201d She sells eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market. Because of the high-quality eggs, customers have been streaming into her compound and the demand has been overwhelming. \n\nTo be able to meet the demand, she is requesting a loan to buy additional poultry. Through the loan she will buy quality breeds of poultry that have high productivity and hence, satisfy the demand that is there. The increased income level will be used to improve her living conditions. \n\nShe plans on expanding her business to other towns.

Poultry farming is a very profitable business venture in Nyamira and is a business that can be done on a part-time basis to earn extra income. Handson does not worry too much about competition because the market for poultry products is good - chicken is a popular meal for many people and this can be seen if you visit any fast food joint. With this loan, Handson is confident that his income will increase and this will allow a permanent change in his life. He plans to buy different breeds of broilers and layers and will be selling eggs and meat to the local market and other major markets in Kenya. He also plans to start breeding, which will help increase the number of poultry on his farm.

Meet Angeline, one of the most hardworking and dedicated women on planet earth. She is based in Mugoiri, a remote village in the Thika area of Kenya. She is happily married. She is blessed with five lovely children. For the past 10 years she has been engaged in mixed farming. She has earned a decent income selling milk and a variety of food crops. Like many farmers in her village, she also plants trees on her farm to complement the region's natural forests. <br \/><br \/>Although Angeline makes profits selling her farm produce at the market, the biggest challenge she faces is lack of water to irrigate her farm and lack of water for home consumption. Angeline comes from an area where there is no water connection, and she is always forced to walk for a long distance for this \u201cprecious commodity.\u201d Being 57 years of age, she faces challenges carrying water on her back because of her failing health. <br \/><br \/>Angeline is seeking a loan to buy a water tank and water pipes. Most of the farmers in Kenya depend on rain-fed agriculture, but Angeline wants to change that notion and start irrigation farming. Through the loan, she intends to harvest rain water, which always goes to waste, and store it in the tanks. She intends to buy pipes that will be used to pump water from the river directly to her farm. With your loan Angeline will be saved the trouble of walking a long distance in search of water, and she will have enough water for home consumption. Irrigating her farm will boast productivity since water is an important requirement in the germination of crops. <br \/><br \/>Angeline is very excited about this project and hopes her dream will be achieved through the loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders. Increased productivity means increased income, and this will translate to improved living standards. She will use the additional income to improve and secure the future of her children. Angeline\u2019s hope for the future is to live a fulfilling life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2021486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a water tank to store rain water, water pipes, and a pump.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Thika","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-11-18T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-18T20:00:02Z","loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Angeline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":180000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5279.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5433.79},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5592.6},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":5756.04},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":5924.26},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6097.4},{"due_date":"2016-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6275.59},{"due_date":"2016-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6459},{"due_date":"2016-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6647.76},{"due_date":"2016-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":6842.04},{"due_date":"2016-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":7042},{"due_date":"2016-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":7247.8},{"due_date":"2016-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":7459.62},{"due_date":"2017-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":7677.63},{"due_date":"2017-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":7902.01},{"due_date":"2017-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":8132.94},{"due_date":"2017-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8370.63},{"due_date":"2017-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8615.26},{"due_date":"2017-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":8867.04},{"due_date":"2017-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":9126.18},{"due_date":"2017-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":9392.89},{"due_date":"2017-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":9667.4},{"due_date":"2017-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":9949.9},{"due_date":"2017-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":10240.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.06},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.58},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.15},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.76},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.42},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.13},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.88},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.69},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.56},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.47},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.44},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.47},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.56},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.71},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.92},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.2},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.54},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.96},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.44},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.99},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.63},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.33},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.12},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-19T03:48:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JoEllen Wilkins","image":null}},{"id":976942,"name":"James","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wonderful Kiva lenders!

Poultry farming has become one of the most important aspects of agriculture in Nyamira because it creates a business opportunity for the smallholder farmer. Poultry farming is a less strenuous activity that is profitable. Many poultry farmers find a sense of fulfillment having hens all over their homestead. The hens lay eggs that can be consumed or sold.

Erick chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rate on their loans is low, and is on a reducing basis. He underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, learning that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions.

Meet David, a 25-year-old father who is so humble, honest and a very hardworking man on this planet Earth. David is a father of two lovely children who he really adores so much and will always do anything good so that they never go to bed with hungry stomachs. David hails from the Kitale area of Kenya. David never got the opportunity to advance his education and get a white collar job but this did not kill his dream of wanting to succeed in life. David started farming and has been doing farming for the past six years. Throughout those years, he has gathered so much experience and all the farming techniques are at his fingertips. David practices mixed farming on his farm, and through the profits, he has managed to take care of his family's needs and give his children a good education because he believes that education is the only \u201ckey to success\u201d. David is a man who is very enterprising. He is seeking a loan of KES 20,000 to buy seeds and start horticulture farming on his farm. Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in his village, good soil and a ready market for horticulture products, David wants to take advantage of that and reap more profits. Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring men like David to make their farming dreams come to reality through training and loan financing. David hopes that through the loan, he will improve his living conditions. David's dreams and projections are that by the end of the first year, he will not only be selling in the local market but will also be selling in international markets through exporting fruits and vegetables. Through this, he will be able to assure his children a secure future and uninterrupted learning because he will be able to pay tuition fees on time."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2021831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy seeds and start horticulture farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-11-18T21:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-18T21:00:04Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1415.46},{"due_date":"2015-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1456.83},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1499.4},{"due_date":"2016-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1543.2},{"due_date":"2016-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1588.32},{"due_date":"2016-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1634.74},{"due_date":"2016-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1682.52},{"due_date":"2016-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1731.69},{"due_date":"2016-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1782.3},{"due_date":"2016-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1834.38},{"due_date":"2016-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1887.99},{"due_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1943.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.16},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.99},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.43},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.88},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.35},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.83},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.82},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.88},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-24T22:31:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Berry","image":null}},{"id":973940,"name":"Mercy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercy lives in a humble home in the town of Siongiroi, along with her husband and four children. She is a rural farmer from an area known for producing long-distance runners who have broken major world records. Mercy works with a great deal of determination, for many hours, on her farm, all to bring decent food to her home and be her family\u2019s support. Mercy has been practicing mixed farming for the past 10 years. On her farm, she grows maize and keeps a dairy cow and poultry. <br \/><br \/>Farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction despite the low earnings. Mercy said, \"I enjoy it most when I see customers come back.\" Her biggest challenge, however, is drought. The long dry season can lead to crop failures and poor yields.

Being a woman, she finds that accessing funds is very challenging, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, she feels relieved knowing that her dream will be achieved, and that she will be able to buy more poultry. <br \/><br \/>As a result of the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market, and this will translate into increased profit and an improved income level. Being a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profits and expand her poultry sales to other markets. This will increase her income and improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used to fully repay the loan, to permanently change her living conditions and to secure the future of her school-going children. <br \/><br \/>Help this hardworking woman realize her dream!"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2022657,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy poultry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-11-18T21:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-18T21:30:07Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2016-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2016-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2016-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2016-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2016-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2016-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2016-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.31},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.14},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.86},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-19T13:44:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Samantha Richardson","image":1220261}},{"id":977791,"name":"Ann","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ann is honest and an eloquent speaker with a strong, commanding manner.

","en":"Virginia is single with no children. She currently lives in her parents' home, where she works making clothes (5-cloth skirts) which she delivers to markets and also sends to communities. Virginia, by her parents' reference, is a very hardworking and responsible person. She only studied up to elementary as she had to work since she was a teenager to help her parents who came to the city of Sucre. <br \/><br \/>Virginia went to work in several sewing workshops where she learned to sew and make skirts. Approximately three years ago, she started making skirts on her own. This helped her enough to improve her income and help her parents. She needs the loan to buy a sewing machine and minor tools such as slats to make greater sewing work and thus improve her income and be able to put together a small tailoring workshop right

Meet Evans, a father of eight from Saiwa, a remote village in the rich highlands of the Kitale area of Kenya. He has spent the past ten years of his life farming. He sells milk, maize, and vegetables produced on his farm. He also engages in personal business to make ends meet. <br \/><br \/>Evans is a go-getter and has a great desire to succeed in life. Of all the activities he involves himself in, dairy farming is the closest to his heart. He enjoys waking up every morning to go and milk his cows and feed them with fodder that has high nutritional value. He is so keen and feels so close to his cows that he has named one of them. Milking one of his cows makes Evans feel very proud and fulfilled. <br \/><br \/>Dairy farming is a highly profitable business venture and Evans wants to take full advantage of it. He would like to expand his dairy business, but the biggest challenge he faces is lack of capital to grow with. He is requesting a loan which he will use to buy a quality breed of dairy cow. <br \/><br \/>Evans has planted Napier grass so that feeding the cows will never be a challenge. He also owns an expansive piece of land, and the excess space will be productively used once he acquires the additional dairy cow. The exotic cow he will buy will produce between 10 to 15 liters of milk daily, and this will translate to more income and profits. <br \/><br \/>The profits from milk selling will allow Evans to grow his business further by starting to package the milk and processing it into other dairy products, such as cream. In addition, he will benefit from the organic manure of the cow. He projects that he will be able to start a bio gas plant at his farm, which will save him money in fuel costs. <br \/><br \/>With your loan, Evans dreams of a secure future for his children. Evans patiently awaits your kindness."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2023463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-11-18T22:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-18T22:00:04Z","loan_amount":425,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evans","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":41600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2944.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3030.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3118.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3209.9},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3303.71},{"due_date":"2016-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3400.26},{"due_date":"2016-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3499.63},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3601.91},{"due_date":"2016-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3707.17},{"due_date":"2016-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3815.51},{"due_date":"2016-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3927.03},{"due_date":"2016-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4041.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.08},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.96},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.86},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.79},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.75},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.74},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.75},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.8},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.88},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.98},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.12},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-24T18:33:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Bruggemann","image":1109275}},{"id":978228,"name":"Alhaji Sule","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alhaji Sule is a maize farmer and Babban Gona member.

Meet Levi. He is a 25-year-old farmer from Kimase village, situated in the Rift Valley province of Kenya. He lives together with his wife and two children on a small piece of land where he keeps cows and poultry and grows a wide variety of crops. <br \/><br \/>For five years, his primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, and horticultural produce. His biggest challenges are diseases and the shortage of farm inputs. Farmers in the area lack capital to purchase farm inputs, such as chemicals to prevent these diseases. <br \/><br \/>Levi made a decision to join Juhudi Kilimo in order to access loans that would help him improve his farming activities. Sometime this month, he applied for a loan for buying seeds to expand his horticulture farm. This will enable him to expand his operations to increase the overall output. <br \/><br \/>The additional income from the expansion will go to his children's education.

It was created in response to the flooding of the Pirai River, in which more than 3000 families were left without homes. <br \/>Blanca has a dark complexion, long jet black hair and is short. (In the photo, she is the first one on the left, wearing a black sweater and a pink t-shirt. <br \/>She shares her life with her partner who works in construction and with her children, who are not yet of school age. They live in a rented room, which is made of brick and has drinking water, electricity and a sewage system. <br \/>The desire to improve her business provided the impetus to create the communal bank. The businesses of the members are selling fruit, selling second hand clothing, selling natural medicine, electronics repairs, interior painting service, selling fruit and washing clothing.<br \/>Blanca's business is selling candy, which she carries out in the streets, carrying a basket full of candy. Her children accompany her. <br \/>\"I sell candies and sweets, when I finish selling for the day, I buy merchandise for the next day...\" she comments. The advantage of the business is that the sales are daily, the disadvantage is the lack of a permanent location to sell her products.  <br \/>Her dream is to have a well stocked kiosk across from a school. She wants to buy a kiosk to sell candies.

Meet Everlyne, a very hardworking and energetic mother of three lovely children. She resides in the Konganyil, Kapsowar area of Kenya, an area with good weather patterns and favorable weather conditions that support farming activities.  She has been doing mixed farming for the past five years and through those years she has gathered much experience with farming techniques. Through the income from farming, she has been able to take care of her family and also provide the basic needs for her children. <br \/><br \/>Everlyne is a very enterprising mum, and although she never got formal education, she has always worked hard on her farm and she has always ensured her family of a decent meal. The Konganyil area has favorable conditions for horticulture farming, and that is why she is seeking a loan to buy seeds and start horticulture farming. <br \/><br \/>Because of good roads, a good climate, and a good transportation network, she is sure that she will reap maximum profits and be able to increase her business.

Sanavbar has a small farm and she raises domestic animals. She works very hard and wants to see her children study so that they become important and educated people.  She and her husband take care of their children's transportation and food costs as well as other expenses.\r\n\r\nSanavbar is taking a loan because she doesn't have enough money to pay for her oldest son's yearly tuition.

Grace is thankful that she now has the opportunity to improve the life of her children and family and looks forward to using her additional earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2023666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating the pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-19T01:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-19T01:50:02Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":92402.86,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":92402.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-19T13:46:14Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Moody","image":null}},{"id":978248,"name":"Talita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Talita is 49 years old, and she lives with her husband and son in Stepanavan city of Lori region.
