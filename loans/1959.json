She resides with her husband and family. She has been actively involved in farming for the last five years and has never regretted or looked back. She practices mixed farming and sells milk, eggs, and various food crops at the local market. Jeniffer passionately loves poultry farming, but the biggest challenge she faces is a lack of capital to buy quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and will lay more eggs. <br \/><br \/>Jeniffer is seeking a loan to purchase additional poultry. She will use her excess maize to feed the poultry and will provide sorghum to give the poultry energy and green grams (beans) for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs that are of good quality, which will translate to more income. Apart from an increase in egg production, she will get increased output from poultry meat, and this will further increase her income and profit margins.

These products are very perishable and require timely delivery to the market, but one problem that she faces is delivering to the market on time. The Mbururu, Kitale area has a poor road network and poor feeder roads that really hamper timely delivery of products to the market. That is why Florence is kindly seeking a loan to buy a motorbike. Using the motorbike, she will deliver products to the market on time and reap more profits because the products will still be fresh. <br \/><br \/>Florence is very determined to succeed, and because she is very disciplined with finances, she expects that, through accumulated profits, she will be able to provide a secure future for herself and also for her parents.

to move things forward. Ugiloy never gives up, though, even in the face of fierce weather or other difficulty.  She is always ready to find a way to support her family.  She is a lovely 44-year-old woman who lives with her family in the Qubadiyon district of Tajikistan.  She gets up as soon as the sun rises and goes straight to her land where work awaits her.  She has her own piece of land on which she grows wheat and sunflowers.

","en":"Marhobo is a young and amicable woman from the Vakhsh region.  She is 20 years old and lives with her mother, father, sister, and brother.  She is the youngest in the family.  Marhobo inherited a talent for sewing from her mother.  She is a very gifted young lady who creates ever newer dresses, putting a little piece of her heart into each of them.  \r\n\r\nMarhobo wants to become a professional in her field and to be a successful person.

She is a rural farmer in Naitiri, Kitale, Kenya, an area known for having bad terrain and a lack of proper infrastructure. She is blessed with a lovely family and has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years.\r\n\r\nOn her farm, she grows maize and raises a dairy cow and poultry. She sells milk, eggs, and maize. To meet her expenses and provide the best for her family, she often engages in small personal businesses to make extra money. However, farming gives her a great sense of satisfaction, despite meager earnings.\r\n\r\nBecause of this challenge, Christine formed a group and joined Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance organization that supports small rural farmers. She acquired a dairy cow. The cow produces milk daily, which Christine sells to a co-operative. The money Christine got from selling the milk was adequate to repay the loan.\r\n\r\nToday, Christine is seeking a new loan to buy another dairy cow because she is planning to become a full-fledged dairy farmer. Her future plan is to construct a zero-grazing unit. That way, she can use the grazing field to plant fodder and prepare silage.

Mathew is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":25,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2025222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-19T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-19T16:40:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mathew","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":36194.67,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":36194.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michael Angelilli","image":1331534}},{"id":976456,"name":"Wanaume Ni Kazi Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Gilbert sollicite un deuxi\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit qui sera orient\u00e9 comme le pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent dans le labour, sarclage, achat des engrais et des produits phytosanitaires.

Meet Catheline (pictured above) from the Muichiune, Nkubu area of Kenya, an area that is very fertile. Catheline is 46 years old and a proud mother of angelic-looking children whom she really adores and cherishes. In addition to doing some small business, Catheline is a very hardworking farmer. She has been farming for the past five years. She has gained so much experience through those years of farming. Catheline practices mixed farming. That is, she grows maize and also keeps dairy cows. Through these activities she has been able to earn a decent and honest income. Because of the passion she has for farming, she has even nicknamed one of her cows. She really enjoys taking care of her cows. \r\n\r\nAlthough Catheline has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious mum. Her farm has not been producing as much of a harvest lately because of the lack of fertilizer and good seeds, and the presence of pests and diseases. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy farm implements and seeds, so as to expand her horticulture farm. Through the loan, Catheline will be assured of a bumper harvest and this will translate into more profits and cash. Through the use of good seeds and fertilizer, she will increase her profit margins. Using this loan, Catheline will be able to expand her horticulture business. She sees a lot of room for improvement and growth. What is lacking is the capital to drive the positive change. With your loan, Catheline will make enough income to take care of her family and other farming expenses.\r\n\r\nShe wakes up early and goes to sleep very late every day to give her family a decent living and afford her children proper education. You can help Catheline with this dream with a loan; that would mean a lot to her and her family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2025232,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy farm implements and seeds to expand her horticulture farm.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nkubu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2015-11-19T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-19T16:50:03Z","loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catheline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":105000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3079.71},{"due_date":"2016-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3169.71},{"due_date":"2016-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3262.34},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3357.69},{"due_date":"2016-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3455.82},{"due_date":"2016-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3556.81},{"due_date":"2016-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3660.76},{"due_date":"2016-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3767.75},{"due_date":"2016-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3877.86},{"due_date":"2016-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3991.19},{"due_date":"2016-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4107.83},{"due_date":"2016-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4227.88},{"due_date":"2016-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4351.44},{"due_date":"2017-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4478.61},{"due_date":"2017-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":4609.5},{"due_date":"2017-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4744.21},{"due_date":"2017-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":4882.86},{"due_date":"2017-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5025.56},{"due_date":"2017-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5172.44},{"due_date":"2017-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5323.6},{"due_date":"2017-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5479.18},{"due_date":"2017-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5639.31},{"due_date":"2017-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5804.19},{"due_date":"2017-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":5973.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.8},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.7},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.62},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.58},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.56},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.57},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.61},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.68},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.78},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.91},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.08},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.28},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.51},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.09},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.44},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.83},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.25},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.72},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.24},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.79},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.39},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.04},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-20T14:53:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Barrett","image":1341863}},{"id":979279,"name":"Faten","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faten is 30 years old and lives in Dairalla.

He is so humble and honest and a very hardworking man on this planet Earth. <br \/><br \/>Fredrick is a father of three lovely children that he really adores so much, and he will always do anything good so that they never go to bed with hungry stomachs. He hails from the Nkubu area of Kenya. He never got the opportunity to advance his education and get a white collar job, but this did not kill his dream of wanting to succeed in life. <br \/><br \/>Fredrick started farming and has been doing farming for the past ten years. Through those years, he has gathered so much experience that all the farming techniques are at his fingertips. Fredrick practices mixed farming on his farm, and through the profits, he has managed to take care of his family's needs and also give his children a good education because he believes that education is the key to success. <br \/><br \/>Fredrick is a farmer who is very enterprising and he is seeking a loan of 75,000 Kenya Shillings (KES) to buy seeds and start horticulture farming on his farm. Because of favorable weather patterns, a good road network in his village, good soil, and a ready market for horticulture products, Fredrick wants to take advantage of those factors and reap more profits. <br \/><br \/>Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva and Kiva lenders to help aspiring men like Fredrick to make their farming dreams come to reality through training and loan financing. Fredrick hopes that, through the loan, he will improve his living conditions. Fredrick\u2019s dreams and projections are that, by the end of the first year, he will not only be selling in the local market but will also be selling in international markets through exporting fruits and vegetables. <br \/><br \/>Through this he will be able to assure his children a secure future and uninterrupted learning because he will be able to pay tuition fees on time.

Like many other rural residents, Abdullojon rears and fattens cattle. Abdullojon began rearing animals after leaving school. Prior to that he would help his father look after the livestock. On finishing school Abdullojon decided to run a business and bought a couple of young bulls with his savings. He fattened them up for four months and sold them for a higher price.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term, as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 1,000 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Hoima Public School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Harriet ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve her students' concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children who fall sick from water-borne diseases, as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2025282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Hoima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-11-19T19:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-19T19:30:04Z","loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hoima Public School","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":6088000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":33,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":761000},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":761000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":761000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":761000},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":761000},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":761000},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":761000},{"due_date":"2018-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":761000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.88},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.88},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":221.88},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.88},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.87},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":221.87},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.87},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-20T00:47:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":977931,"name":"Marvin Josue","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marvin, de 26 a\u00f1os de edad, es un hombre muy trabajador y muy dedicado a sus responsabilidades laborales, muy conocido en su comunidad por su excelente comportamiento y por su alto grado de servicio a los dem\u00e1s, est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ad y vive con su pareja y sus dos hijas.\n\n\nMarvin, trabaja como promotor de salud de su comunidad, \u00e9l se dedica a visitar todas las casas de su comunidad para dar charlas de saneamiento b\u00e1sico y h\u00e1bitos de higiene y tambi\u00e9n lleva el control de las vacunad de los ni\u00f1os y ni\u00f1as es empleado de la unidad de salud de su municipio; tiene 3 a\u00f1os de experiencia y est\u00e1 es su principal fuente de ingresos.\n\n\nMarvin, necesita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar una motocicleta, la cual le servir\u00e1 para desplazarse para su lugar de trabajo,  y realizar las vivitas de campo, de esta manera le resultara m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil viajar a su trabajo y en el entorno de su comunidad.\n\nLos sue\u00f1os de Marvin, son tener una vivienda propia y apoyar en la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijas.\n","en":"Marvin is 26 years old.

Duhaga Girls School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. <br \/><br \/>The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water, and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term, as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450-litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Duhaga Girls School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

There the members of communal bank Mujeres Por El Progreso (\"Women for Progress\") meet every other week.\r\nMar\u00eda is 33 years old and lives in this town. She's married and from this marriage she has two children, aged 11 and 10, who are both in school. Mar\u00eda's husband doesn't have a permanent job.\r\nMar\u00eda is a woman who likes to support her husband so that she can get her household and her children ahead. Their children are her greatest priority. In order to obtain financial resources, she built a small pen in her house with the help of her first loan 7 years ago. There she raised chickens and with each loan she has received she has been able to improve production. This has allowed her to gradually improve her and her children's living conditions. That's why she's very happy and thankful to the foundation and the people who support her so that she can get her loans.\r\nThis loan is to purchase more chickens, since a favorable season is approaching and she hopes to be ready to sell at very good prices. She has been with the community bank for over 7 years and she likes it because of the help they always provide to her. Her dream is to give her children the very best in life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1461550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2015-11-19T23:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-19T23:50:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1093.51,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":79.03},{"due_date":"2015-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":88.36},{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":89.11},{"due_date":"2015-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":89.87},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":90.64},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":91.41},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":92.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":92.98},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":93.77},{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.57},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":95.38},{"due_date":"2016-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":96.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.5},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.88},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.64},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.4},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.18},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.95},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.74},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.53},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.13},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.95},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.77}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-22T01:29:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Renata Wolff","image":null}},{"id":979352,"name":"Dauda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dauda is a Babban Gona maize farmer.

She is 32, married, and the mother of one child.  Her husband works the land and also operates a tractor, depending on the season.  Her son helps around the farm and with the livestock.  Oyimniso became involved in animal husbandry after she got married so that she could help her husband provide for the family.  Her husband supported her in her endeavor and helped her to buy a couple head of young livestock.  Gradually, Oyimniso was able to increase her livestock headcount and she started making a good income from animal sales.\r\n\r\nThanks to her farming business, Oyimniso and her family do not lack anything.  At the moment though, because of lower livestock prices, Oyimniso cannot sell her grown livestock without losing a part of her profits.  In order to solve this problem, she has decided to turn to Kiva's partner, MDO Arvand, and she has requested financial support.  She is planning to use her loan to buy some animal feed for the winter and to take advantage of low prices to buy some young livestock.

She is involved in animal husbandry while her husband works in construction in their own village.  Shohsanam and her husband are very happy together.  Shohsanam does everything she can to help and support her husband and he is, in turn, very grateful for his wife's help.  Their family is cited as an example in the village, because they have been showing love and respect for each other for several years.  However, the salary that Shohsanam's husband makes is only sufficient to cover the very basic necessities of life.

In the countryside, the place where she lives, she also has a farm where she raises chickens and pigs.

For this reason, she bought these little animals, which are giving her very good income, with the loans.<br \/><br \/>She is going to use this loan to buy food for the chickens and pigs, as well as school supplies for her stationery store.
