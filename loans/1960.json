lives in a rural area.  She is 35, married, and the mother of two children.  She is involved in animal husbandry; she buys young livestock, fattens her animals for a few months, and then resells them at a higher price.  She got involved in this activity when she was still a child as her father also worked in animal husbandry and had a small number of livestock.  Umida used to help her father with the farm animals; she fed them and sent them to graze.  After she got married, she decided to start her own animal husbandry business and she bought her first two young bulls with some money that she had saved.  Gradually, she was able to increase her turnover.\r\n\r\nUmida's husband regularly goes to Russia and works there as a plasterer on private construction sites.  Umida's children are both in school but they also help their mom after school, when they have some free time.  Umida herself has a second occupation; she works as a kitchen assistant in a cafeteria during the day.  At the moment, she is out of animal feed and she can't sell her animals because prices are very low.  In order to solve this problem, she has decided to turn to Kiva's partner, MDO Arvand, for support.

In this place we found the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank group \u201cMujer Trabajadora\u201d (or \u201cHardworking Women\u201d), formed by 10 women who share the common goal of creating a more prosperous future for themselves and their families. \r\n\r\nThe ladies of this group want to see their children go to school and have the tools they need to have successful lives. The women have various businesses that include the sale of snacks and lunches, as well as tortillas made and sold three times daily from a small tortilla shop called a 'tortilleria'.  Another lady has a bakery and offers delicious breads and other baked items for sale. Still another woman sells shoes.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Trust Bank is Amelia, who is 49 years old. She studied until the fifth grade. Her lack of formal education has not stopped this hardworking, divorced mother of three children. She has a lunch sales business that is doing well. She is requesting a loan to buy rice, corn, beans, oil and other ingredients to make her tasty lunches.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cMicrocredit Plus Program\" of Friendship Bridge that combines small loans and educational training is of great benefit to Amelia and the ladies in the Trust Bank. At their monthly meetings, a Facilitator from the organization shares relevant and useful knowledge with the women about effective business.\r\n\r\nKiva investors are highly valued by Amelia and the ladies in the Trust Bank.

Today she has two dairy cows, and she also grows barley for sale. Her monthly income from running the business is up to 14,000 som (KGS), but these funds are insufficient for a decent life and supporting a family. In order to develop her farm further, Nadezhda has applied to Bai Tushum Bank for a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) to buy two cows and feed for the livestock. The proceeds of the loan will enable Nadezhda to improve her family's well-being and save up to buy a car for her family."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2006789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy two cows and feed for her livestock in order to increase her income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Zhaiylgan village, Talas region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-11-20T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-20T19:00:03Z","loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nadezhda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":6431},{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":6621},{"due_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":6817},{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":7018},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":7226},{"due_date":"2016-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":7440},{"due_date":"2016-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":7660},{"due_date":"2016-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":7886},{"due_date":"2016-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8120},{"due_date":"2016-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8360},{"due_date":"2016-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8607},{"due_date":"2016-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":8862},{"due_date":"2016-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":9124},{"due_date":"2016-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":9394},{"due_date":"2017-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":9672},{"due_date":"2017-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":9958},{"due_date":"2017-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":10253},{"due_date":"2017-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":10551}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.18},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.9},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.71},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.59},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.57},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.64},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.79},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.03},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.39},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.83},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.37},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.02},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.78},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.65},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":138.63},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.73},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.96},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":979828,"name":"Jena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jena has always loved farming and grown her own corn in Calamba.

She lives with her husband and her younger son, who is a university student who depends on them financially. For many years, she worked for a national television station, but when she was pregnant with her second child, the doctors told her that it was a high-risk pregnancy and she should not work. After being on disability leave for several months, when her son was born premature, she decided to quit her job and focus on taking care of her son, who needed special care. Over time, as her son's health stabilized, she needed to find self-employment to be able to help her husband and provide for their children. <br \/><br \/>She started out selling ice cream from her home, products that were well known in the community  for tradition and quality. Then, the owner of the ice cream factory in Tierra Blanca offered her a route where she would be in charge of ice cream sales and distribution. She accepted this opportunity in partnership with a longtime friend, Amanda. She started out in the ice cream sales business more than five years ago. Together, they successfully established the business.<br \/><br \/>Today, she continues to look for new market niches in other business projects, such as preparing and selling packaged ceviches. She is taking the first steps in this new branch of her business with her older son. <br \/><br \/>In ice cream sales, her main clients are small grocery and convenience stores throughout the province of Heredia. She runs her route three times per week to sell her product. In her ceviche business, she would be another provider of the prepared, packed product to sell it to a consolidated company called Lima Fish, which sells prepared foods to small restaurant businesses in the Heredia  and Alajuela free trade zones. It is her older son's company. Mireidy is convinced that the quality of the product and the experience she gained working occasionally  with her son would allow her to make a quality, competitive product and become established in the market. When she starts to focus on making ceviches, she and her son plan to make a contract stating that she will be in charge of supplying two of the restaurants from the existing client list. She has already planned how she would combine both businesses, since she does not plan to abandon her well established business selling ice cream with her business partner.<br \/><br \/>Mireidy washes all recyclables and takes them to the community childcare center, which sells them to raise money for their services to the community. <br \/><br \/>This new loan is Mireidy's opportunity to enter into a new business, while developing an existing one, all in the interest of improving her quality of life, continuing to support her son so that he can complete his higher education, and starting her savings for a future retirement for her husband and, of course, for herself."}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2024057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"to buy ice cream and supplies and groceries for preparing ceviches.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Heredia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2015-11-21T02:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-21T02:10:01Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mireidy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":24402.89},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":24768.93},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":25140.47},{"due_date":"2016-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":25517.57},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":25900.34},{"due_date":"2016-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":26288.84},{"due_date":"2016-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":26683.18},{"due_date":"2016-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":27083.42},{"due_date":"2016-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":27489.67},{"due_date":"2016-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":27902.02},{"due_date":"2017-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":28320.55},{"due_date":"2017-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":28745.36},{"due_date":"2017-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":29176.54},{"due_date":"2017-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":29614.19},{"due_date":"2017-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":30058.4},{"due_date":"2017-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":30509.28},{"due_date":"2017-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":30966.91},{"due_date":"2017-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":31431.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.36},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.06},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.77},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.48},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.21},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.95},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.7},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.46},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.23},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.01},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.81},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.62},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.43},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.27},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.11},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.97},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.84},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.72}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-30T03:34:02Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Kanost","image":1462367}},{"id":979967,"name":"Pamela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pamela is 42 years old and married with five children.

All this because it is an area with a hot humid climate and also as it is a city that unites the different regions of the country.<br \/><br \/>Carmen comments that she has worked very hard to get her family ahead. A number of years ago she lived in Spain with her husband and she had to leave her children in the care of family. They needed to travel as at that time the economy was very difficult and it was hard to support their children. Eight years ago they decided to return but they couldn't make up the lost time as their little ones had become adolescents. Carmen and her husband have given them all the love possible.<br \/><br \/>Since then Carmen doesn't want to be separated more from her children so she started a business from her house making empanadas and corviques (another local baked food). She has run this business up to now and thanks to this income one of her children has completed secondary school and she also managed to open a small store. She is happy even though she doesn't generate much income she can take care of the family and work. Her husband also helps making deliveries in a small van that he has. <br \/><br \/>Carmen with this loan she was awarded can buy more rice, oil, soft drinks and other necessities for her store.
