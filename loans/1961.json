servant, and also a caring father of four. He is 45 years old, and lives in the Vakhsh region with his family. The area is not inhabited by a large population and Bobojon and his family have lived in this town for a long time.<br \/><br \/>Raising 4 children alone is hard. All of his children are studying, and their eduction requires a lot of funds, but Bobojon does not begrudge this money. Soon he will have to pay for his son's university studies, and buy textbooks for the other children. For this reason, Bobojon applied for a loan, and hopes that his children will receive a dignified

Several years ago his beloved wife passed away, but from this relationship he has 6 adult children who are independent. Don Jos\u00e9 is a very hard-working man who likes to earn a living honestly. He has always worked in construction, but the work is sometimes scarce. This is why, with some savings that he had and later with the help of the loans, he built a shed in which he raises chickens. He purchases the chickens when they are still small and he keeps them for 2 or 3 months. After that he sells them to merchants or delivers them to neighbors. This is the way he earns an income to survive even when he is not working in construction.\r\nHe will use this loan to purchase chickens and feed so that they grow more quickly. He has been in the loan group for 2 years, and he enjoys it because the loans help him a lot.

In spite of not living with her husband since, for various reasons, they had to separate, she has done all she could to bring money to her home.  For years she has worked raising pigs but currently the return from this business has reduced significantly, for which reason she found herself in need of starting another business which provided her with more income and enabled her to continue sustaining her family.  Yadira is a loyal client of this institution.  With her first loan she could strengthen her pig business, and buy more animals and animal feed.  But as that business was producing less income,  she managed to sell them at a good price and with that money she could start another activity.  Now she works providing maintenance and electric services.  She has been doing this for four months and she has done well, but she needs more capital to keep growing her business.  With this second loan she will be able to capitalize the business, buy more spare parts and continue to provide her services.

Anticipating a good harvest this season, Isuwa has the opportunity to attain yields of up to 8 metric tonnes of maize per hectare of land, 5.5 times that of the average Nigerian maize farmer. <br \/><br \/>Before joining Babban Gona, Isuwa would have had to sell his maize at harvest, a period when maize prices are at their lowest in the market, to meet his immediate cash needs such as food and clothing. Thanks to Babban Gona\u2019s support, Isuwa can store his maize and sell it at a future date for up to 37% higher than the market price at harvest. <br \/><br \/>As a Babban Gona member, Isuwa will benefit from marketing support that could see him generate earnings of up to $2,000 per hectare of land. Isuwa is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to provide employment to members of his community through his farm."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1949229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-22T09:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-22T09:10:03Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isuwa ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":17699.49,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":17699.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-22T13:36:20Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kyla Evans","image":null}},{"id":978961,"name":"Firuza","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0424\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430. \u0415\u0439 21 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0439. \u0422\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0435. \u0412 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440 \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u043d\u043e \u0443 \u043d\u0435\u0451 \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0432 \u041c\u0414\u041e \u0410\u0440\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0434 \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442 \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0443 \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0435.
