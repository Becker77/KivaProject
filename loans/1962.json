Hursant raises cattle and sells their meat and milk.  Hursant earns a good income from the business.  Hursant's husband works in the village school and his job brings an additional income for the family.

His mother passed away when he was very young and this meant that his father had to make some difficult sacrifices in order to pay for schooling for himself and his brother.  Emmanuel is very passionate about wanting to be a successful entrepreneur and this vision has shaped the life he now leads, and has kept him disciplined and focused. \r\n\r\nEmmanuel is an emerging entrepreneur, operating his own Zoona mobile money transfer business.  His business provides financial services to people in his community that do not have access to banking.  Emmanuel loves his business because it gives him a chance to learn a lot of things from the different people he meets on a daily basis.  He says his community benefits from his business because they do not have to move long distances to access financial services and his services are very easy to use and not intimidating.  He operates one Zoona outlet and can be found at his outlet on a daily basis. \r\n\r\nEmmanuel\u2019s biggest challenge is that he does not have enough money in his business to serve his customers, and the trading booth he is using to complete transactions is not one that he owns.  Therefore, he is requesting his first Kiva loan to help him purchase a Zoona branded trading booth.  He will use the rest of the money to serve customers with additional financial float.  \r\n\r\nEmmanuel is excited to be connected to Kiva lenders.

positive and hardworking woman. She is 34 years old. She is married and has three children. She lives in a small rural village. Since her childhood, Nilufar dreamed of becoming a doctor. However the circumstances were such that she was not able to get higher education, due to her family's lack of finances. <br \/><br \/>Soon after finishing high school, Nilufar got married. This way she became a housewife. However even if she stays at home, Nilufar never sits idle. Together with her husband, she strives to do everything possible to provide their children with everything necessary. In order to have a stable income for food, Nilufar and her husband started their own business. They work with livestock breeding.<br \/><br \/>Nilufar breeds livestock and then sells the meat and milk from it. She gets a good income from this business.  Nilufar's husband also works as a local builder, and his work brings in an additional income. Their combined income is enough for middle class living. And still they don't have enough money to cover all their needs.<br \/><br \/>Currently Nilufar and her husband would like to purchase some additional livestock to breed.

good and hardworking woman. She is 42 years old. She is married and has five children. She lives in a small rural village. Since her childhood, Madina dreamed of becoming a teacher, however the circumstances were such that she was not able to get higher education due to her family's insufficient financials. <br \/><br \/>Soon after finishing high school, Madina got married. This way she became a housewife. However, ever if she stays at home, she never sits idle. Together with her husband she strives to do everything possible to provide their children with all necessities. To have a stable income for food, Madina and her husband started their own business. They work with livestock breeding.<br \/><br \/>Madina breeds livestock and then sells the meat and milk. She gets a good income from this business. Madina's husband also works as a local builder, and his work brings in an additional income for the family. Their combined income is enough for middle class living.

She is from the south part of Kyrgyzstan, which is the biggest and hottest region in the country. Its people raise cattle, grow fruits and vegetables, and do sales in bazaars, but the majority of people are unemployed.<br \/><br \/>Aizirek\u2019s family is not an exception. She has a big family of nine: parents, two elder brothers, elder sister, herself, two younger brothers and a younger sister. Her elder brother and elder sister are married and live separately. Her parents are unemployed: her mother has to do household work and her father is a veteran of the Afghan war. For this reason, her father gets a small amount of compensation from the state. The family has had hard times. It was so difficult to feed the members that the second elder brother went to the neighboring country of Kazakhstan to work as a migrant. So the main source of income for this family is the money sent by the brother in Kazakhstan. Aizirek says that time is passing and her younger siblings are going to school, which means additional expenses.<br \/><br \/>As with thousands of people, Aizirek dreamed to study at the best university which is accredited at an international level.

Piece by piece, she has managed to build a structure she feels proud of. Still, after ten years she has not been able to move in, since the floor is still dirt and the walls are not covered.

is a kindhearted and hardworking woman of 45. She is married and has three children. She lives in a small rural village. As a child she dreamed of becoming a teacher but circumstances did not allow her to receive a higher education, because of financial difficulties in her family. Immediately after finishing high school she got married and became a homemaker. But even though she stays at home all the time, she never sits idle. She and her husband try to do everything possible to give their children everything they need.\r\n\r\nIn order to receive a steady income to pay for food, Jumagul and her husband started their own animal husbandry business. She raises cattle and sells the meat and milk she receives from them. She earns a good living from this business. Her husband works in forestry and his job brings in additional income.

Shazia also plans to put the profits of her husband's income into savings, to meet her family's needs in the future.\r\n\r\nShazia is very grateful to Kiva and BRAC Pakistan."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":25,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2027360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":["Job Creation"],"use":"to cover the cost of repairing her husband's taxi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Rawalpindi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":247,"posted_date":"2015-11-23T02:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-23T02:10:03Z","loan_amount":300,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shazia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2090},{"due_date":"2016-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2157},{"due_date":"2016-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2226},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2297},{"due_date":"2016-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2371},{"due_date":"2016-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2446},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2525},{"due_date":"2016-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2606},{"due_date":"2016-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2689},{"due_date":"2016-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2775},{"due_date":"2016-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":2864},{"due_date":"2016-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2954}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.9},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.57},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.26},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.97},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.71},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.46},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.25},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.06},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.89},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.75},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.64},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie B"}},{"id":980572,"name":"Chi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A local resident living in a rural area of Stoeng Sen district of Kampong Thom province, Chi is a 58-year-old woman and the married mother of eight children, two of whom are schoolchildren and need her support in their studies.

She lives with her partner and has a son who is 3 years old and a daughter who is 6 months old. Her business is selling potatoes.<br \/><br \/>Rosmery is resilient, free and very hardworking. She conducts her business in the town of Paicoco, characterized for its proximity to the sacred lake Titicaca. The majority of its population works in fishing, agriculture and raising cattle. The climate is cold and dry.<br \/><br \/>Rosmery is brown-skinned, with long black hair that she wears braided. She wears traditional dress (hat, blanket and skirt). Her mother tongue is Aymara, which she speaks at home, and she speaks Spanish outside the home and in her business. She lives with her partner, who works in agriculture, and her children, who are not yet of schooling age. They live in a home owned by the family constructed with adobe with a straw roof. Their home has electricity but does not have running water or a sewage system because these services are not available in the area. <br \/><br \/>Rosmery's business is selling natural and dehydrated potatoes like \"el chu\u00f1o\" and \"la tunta,\" which are produced by the dehydration of potatoes in order to preserve them for a long time. The method of drying that is used consists of exposing the potatoes to a continuous cycle of freezing and sunlight. In each cycle, the potato loses water until the heat from the sunlight and pressing finish the job. The making of \"el chu\u00f1o\" is seasonal and subject to weather conditions that guarantee the presence of intense frosts. \"In the season for selling el chu\u00f1o, I buy them wholesale and save it until supply is scarce to sell them at a better price...\", she says. The advantage of her business is that it is independent and she has time to take care of her family. The disadvantage is that on days to purchase the chu\u00f1o, she works from the early morning. Her dream is to improve her quality of life. She wishes to buy chu\u00f1o wholesale. This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 4 years that she has worked at this business.<br \/><br \/>It is for these reasons that Rosmery is applying for a loan to buy chu\u00f1o wholesale to sell in high season."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2026601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy chu\u00f1o wholesale to sell it in high season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-11-23T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-23T03:30:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosmery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":473.05},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":464.75},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":502.98},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":532.23},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":532.74},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":576},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":588.55},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":614.4},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":645.23},{"due_date":"2016-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":663.86},{"due_date":"2016-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":704.85},{"due_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":701.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.27},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.05},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.65},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.93},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.01},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.34},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.18},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.97},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.48},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.21},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.21},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Verna Krishnamurthy","image":1691630}},{"id":980818,"name":"Zahraa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zahraa is a 25-year-old married woman living with her husband.

","en":"Tahmina is a kind and hardworking young woman.  She is 21 years old and recently married to a devoted husband.  She is also a very talented seamstress.  She learned how to sew from her mother and has now been involved in this activity for the past six years.  Harmony prevails in the family.  Her husband trusts her and supports her in all her endeavors.\r\n\r\nRecently, the car used by Tahmina's husband broke down.

He would like to use this additional income to ensure that all his children get a post-secondary education."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2027445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-23T03:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-23T03:40:07Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Musa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":31833.32,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":31833.32}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":979336,"name":"Ravshangul","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0420\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0443\u043b \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0443\u043c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 4 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0422\u0440\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u0438 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0441\u044b\u043d. \u0418\u043c \u043f\u043e 19, 18, 16 \u0438 13 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043a\u0438, \u0430 \u043c\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438. \u041c\u0443\u0436 \u0420\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0443\u043b \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438. \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0420\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0443\u043b \u0448\u0432\u0435\u044f. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 2 \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0448\u044c\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044f \u0438 \u0448\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b. \u042d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0420\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0443\u043b \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0443 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0434\u043a\u0438. \u0420\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u0435\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434. \u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044f \u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0443  \u0420\u0430\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0443\u043b \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044e. \u0414\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0443\u0447\u0435\u0431\u044b \u0434\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0438, \u0420\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0443\u043b\u0443 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0430, \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0443 \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0430. \u0415\u0439 \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432. \u0418\u0437-\u0437\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u0420\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0443\u043b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u0412\u0430\u0441 \u043e \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u0438. \u0418 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u0430\u0448\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0443.
