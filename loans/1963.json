She sells milk on a daily basis and also grows alfalfa on 2.26 hectares of land.

She wants her children to benefit from the best education so that they can escape from poverty. For that reason, she has tried hard to increase production and improve income for her family.

With Babban Gona\u2019s support, Shahid can store his maize and sell it in the future for up to 37% higher than the market price at harvest. \r\n\r\nShahid is grateful to be part of the Babban Gona family and in the end hopes to use his increased earnings to ensure that all his children get a post secondary education.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2027606,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-23T11:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-23T11:40:02Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shahid","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":17531.6,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":17531.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-23T12:55:48Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Leigh-ann Onnis","image":null}},{"id":980510,"name":"Union Sicre Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Los socios pertenecen al banco comunal \u201cUNION SICRE\u201d; Este banco se ubicada en la  provincia de La Convenci\u00f3n y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia Estela es una mujer trabajadora, ella se dedica a la agricultura, produce diversos productos, como frutas y tub\u00e9rculos, ella saco adelante a su familia con esta actividad, ella tiene 65 a\u00f1os de edad y continua trabajando.\nLa socia solicito el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar semillas y abono.

With Babban Gona\u2019s support, Abdulrazak will store the maize he harvests and delay its sale until a date later in the season when he can obtain a significantly higher price for his maize at a premium up to 37% more than the harvest price. <br \/><br \/>With the opportunity to earn up to $2000 per hectare of land, Abdulrazak now has the opportunity to actualize his dream to grow his agriculture business for himself and family members and would like to use this additional income to move into a better home with his family."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2027697,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-23T13:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-23T13:00:02Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdulrazak","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":44595.56,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":44595.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michael Angelilli","image":1331534}},{"id":980908,"name":"Breakthrough Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The women in the picture above believe that every challenge you encounter in life is a fork in the road. You have to choose which way to go; backward, forward, breakdown or breakthrough. Although everybody else is standing, these women aspire to stand out in their businesses through hard work and perseverance. In this case surely, winners are not born winners; they are learning and practising how to win. As for Demetria and her group members; while most are dreaming of success, they wake-up and work hard to achieve it. Despite the economic situation around them, they know that sometimes you win and sometimes you learn, therefore, giving up is never an option. <br \/><br \/>Demetria is a member of the Breakthrough group, she is 44 years old. Demetria is a cross-border trader to Zambia, South Africa and Botswana where she restocks new and second hand clothes for re-sale. She also runs a pre-school which currently has 34 pupils enrolled. Although her husband has been on retirement for 8 years now, Demetria has been taking care of her family with very little struggles. But sustaining two businesses has been taking a lot more than she expected. Since she opened her pre-school in 2014, Demetria has been unable to cross the border as much as she used to. To be competitive, she has to restock at least twice a month to South Africa, Botswana or Zambia. There is always not enough capital for her to cross the border and keep her pre-school running. This is when Demetria and her friends joined Thrive in September 2015. The training they received has gone a long way in enriching her business knowledge in areas such as savings, daily record keeping and marketing. With a loan from Thrive, Demetria hopes to boost both her business by growing her pre-school and restocking more clothing from the neighbouring countries."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2027694,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to buy books and other educational materials for her pre-school and more clothes for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Chitungwiza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-11-23T13:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-23T13:00:03Z","loan_amount":1700,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sylvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abigail","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esinathy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Demetria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":283.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":283.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-23T19:32:35Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michael Angelilli","image":1331534}},{"id":980907,"name":"Marina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Marina actualmente vive en el Departamento de La Paz en la provincia Aroma  Municipio de Patacamaya desde muy joven se dedic\u00f3 a la agricultura ayudando a sus padres tiene un nivel de instrucci\u00f3n primario por motivos econ\u00f3micos no alcanzo a terminar el colegio ya que no contaba con el apoyo econ\u00f3mico de sus padres actualmente es de estado civil Soltera no tiene dependientes vive en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su madre la misma que es una se\u00f1ora de la tercera edad a la cual cuida y le ayuda a su manutenci\u00f3n, el a\u00f1o 2006  realizo el curso de corte confecci\u00f3n de ropa deportiva y poller\u00eda (ropa de las se\u00f1oras del altiplano pace\u00f1o) que se llev\u00f3 a cabo en la Comunidad de Chiarumani, como tambi\u00e9n realizo un curso de Pollereria en el Centro de Promoci\u00f3n de la mujer Gregoria Apaza con una duraci\u00f3n de 3 meses desde entonces no alcanzo a comprar m\u00e1quinas de coser para abrir un taller de confecci\u00f3n de polleras  por lo que solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para la compra de m\u00e1quinas de coser Recta y Over para la elaboraci\u00f3n de polleras y enaguas para cholitas el cr\u00e9dito le ser\u00e1 de gran ayuda para la se\u00f1ora ya que ser\u00e1 un capital semilla para agrandar su propio negocio, incrementar sus ingresos y de esa manera mejorar su calidad de vida.

CCT's partnership with Kiva and the untiring support of Kiva lenders encourage her all the more, since the partnership gives better opportunities for small entrepreneurs like herself to avail of higher loans.<br \/><br \/>Cristeta's previous loan amounting to 25,000 PHP went a long way. It enabled her to buy enough groceries, toiletries and beverages to fill her inventory. It resulted to a higher income that supported her family's daily needs. Recently she started a bakery and is now paying three helper-bakers.  <br \/><br \/>She plans to further improve her business not only for her family but also for the families of her helper-bakers. This is why she appeals for loan of 35,000 PHP this time. She will use it primarily to buy additional supplies for her variety store plus raw ingredients for her bakery. She doesn't stop thinking about possible ways to enhance her businesses.<br \/><br \/>Cristeta is determined to maintain her good record, and she continues to meet with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of their work every week. It is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from religion. <br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study God, build social capital and repay their microfinance loans."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2027722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy additional supplies for her variety store plus raw ingredients for her bakery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2015-11-23T13:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-23T13:20:16Z","loan_amount":750,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cristeta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1458.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-23T16:08:43Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kavita Shah","image":780734}},{"id":980933,"name":"Fhebe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Generally, people are conscious about their looks.

The lesson on savings is one that she took to heart. She started saving money and these savings were a lifesaver as she used them to buy a ticket for her daughter to come back home after studying in Ukraine on a scholarship. She now keeps proper track of her business through the record-keeping lessons she attended. <br \/><br \/>She believes that working in a group has benefited her immensely through being inspired by her group members and receiving social and emotional support from them. <br \/><br \/>Getrude is planning on using her second loan to get more chickens and feed that can take the chickens up to the requisite six weeks at a healthy and good weight.

The Friendship Bridge Trust Bank Las Rosas de Chibuc was formed here by nine entrepreneurial women who seek to raise the living standard of their lives, eliminate poverty, empower themselves and educate their children. These women have various businesses including animal husbandry; the sale of bakery items including bread; and the sale of vegetables, peanuts and caramel corn.<br \/><br \/>The Secretary of the Trust Bank is 27-year-old Juana who is married with three children. Two of the children are in school since Juana is very aware of the value of education in their lives. Juana sells peanuts and other seeds both at the retail and wholesale level. Because of increased demand, Juana is requesting a loan that she will use to buy a large quantity of peanuts at the wholesale level and then resell.

The second half is devoted to educational training with one relevant topic presented for the ladies to participate in each month.

","en":"Jovidjon is a 26-year-old resident of the Bohtar region. He lives with his mother, sister and wife. He doesn't have any children yet. He is the only one in the family who works and he feeds the whole family. He has been an independent, talented guy since he was a child. He has a workshop where he manufactures wooden chests. He works alone and is an excellent carver, and his engravings turn out well too. He has had this occupation for three years.

Coconut water alone is a delicious thirst quencher, eliminates toxins in the body, and naturally flushes small kidney stones. While coconut meat is so versatile that it can be eaten raw, mixed in salad, shredded and juiced as main ingredient in many Filipino dishes. <br \/><br \/>Coconuts grow well in tropical countries like the Philippines. But the crowded cities cannot accommodate this tall tree, so the supply of coconuts in the city comes from the provinces. Virgilio, 56, saw this need many years ago, hence he decided to sell young coconuts in Pasay City. It continues to be a booming business as people learn this healthy alternative to soda drinks. It serves as Virgilio\u2019s primary source of income that sustains his children\u2019s needs and education. He\u2019s already widowed, that\u2019s why he tries his best to earn enough for their daily sustenance.<br \/><br \/>He is imploring your kindness to lend him additional capital of PHP 8,000. With this amount, he can buy more young coconuts to resell that will lead to his increased profit. He is praying that you would extend your hand to him.

Among more than 93 universities in Kyrgyzstan, she has chosen to study at AUCA. She has a great desire to study here because only it has reputation of the honest and corruption free university, where all depends on everyone\u2019s knowledge and aspirations. She wants to get strong and good knowledge and be successful as the AUCA Alumni, who work worldwide at Google, Cisco System, BBC, Citibank, IBM, etc.<br \/><br \/>An international atmosphere of the university also plays a great role for Daana, as she loves to meet foreign people, and discover something new for her. Lessons taught in English will improve her language skills and prepare her for the communication with people abroad. Daana wants to be a politician, so all above said knowledge and practice is needed for her future profession. She loves Kyrgyzstan and proud of it. She hopes to get a degree and be useful for her country. She thinks that assisting in the development of Motherland depends on every citizen and should be a must for everyone living here.<br \/><br \/>Daana lives with her mother and younger sister. Her mother works in two places as a psychologist and a manager, as she is the only person to support her family.

Since childhood he wanted to be a lawyer who would protect the rights of people. He is confident that he has good qualities to become a lawyer such as sociability, honesty, a good memory, logical thinking, making the right decisions, and responsibility. Respecting others and decency are his main goals. The difficulties and obstacles that come with this occupation sparked his interest in it and give him an incentive for further development. It motivates him to help people and he is sure that his help and knowledge will be needed by people.\r\n\r\nAziret came to study at AUCA from the south part of Kyrgyzstan. In Jalal-Abad he has a family of six people: his parents, two elder sisters, himself, and a younger sister. His father used to be a building engineer, but for the last 6 years he has run his own small shop. Aziret\u2019s mother is a 44-year-old housewife. His two elder sisters are also students at universities in his home town -- one is a future economist and other is a future lawyer. They study at ordinary local universities, as his family hasn't had the opportunity to send them to study in the capital.. Taking into consideration that Aziret is the only son in the family, his parents are trying their best to assist him to study at AUCA. Aziret\u2019s education plays great role in his family since, according to the Kyrgyz people's mentality, he will be the right hand and the main supporter of his family after his father. Being the only son to assist his family in the future makes Aziret a serious and a diligent student. He loves his family and respects the traditions.\r\n\r\nBy supporting Aziret Kiva lenders not just help him to get a degree, but help the whole country raise the next lawyer with big ambitions."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2028190,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for his higher education.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Jalal-Abad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":326,"posted_date":"2015-11-23T16:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-23T16:10:08Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aziret","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":68,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jessica Barrett","image":1341863}},{"id":981195,"name":"Thouch's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The members of Thouch\u2019s group live in a rural village in Phnom Penh province in Cambodia.

She is applying for AUCA\u2019s financial aid and Kiva loan to cover the part of her university tuition fee as her family has financial difficulties. <br \/>Aruuke\u2019s family has 4 members: her father, her mother, brother and herself. As the majority of Asian people, her parents work at local market\/bazaar. They have to wake up at 4-5 am in the morning and work till 5-6 pm until the market closes. Aruuke says that her family\u2019s income was always enough to feed its members, but the last economic crisis has made it worse. After Kyrgyzstan\u2019s entrance into the Customs Union and the Eurasian Economic Union, the rise in customs tariffs in neighbouring Kazakhstan cut the volume of imports from Kyrgyzstan to Customs Union countries. And so Kyrgyzstan was left with a choice: either continue re-exporting goods to Kazakhstan and Russia (in smaller quantities and with less profit) or join the economic alliance and try to increase domestic production. The government chose the second option. <br \/>Aruuke says that the happening changes in the country\u2019s political and economic system is very interesting to discover and make a research for her, as she is the future politician. But the given circumstances cause a problem with her university tuition payment. <br \/><br \/>Choosing the right university is as important for her as choosing the future profession.

He has 17 years' experience of coffee production and over 5 years' experience in producing special coffees which, with the support of COCAFCAL of which he is a member, he sells direct to his buyers. Narciso is the father of two children and his main aim is to give them a decent life and teach them to grow coffee in the best way possible so that they can produce quality in an environmentally friendly way. Narciso is known for the quality of his products as his coffee plantation holds Fair Trade, Organic and UTZ certification. To improve the quality of his coffee even further, he prepares it in solar-powered dryers. This increases the beans' flavours and aroma and maintains a constant level of humidity which slows down the rate at which it deteriorates in the warehouse. It is for this reason that many buyers prefer his coffee. Narciso is applying for a loan to build a solar-powered dryer. The money will help him to buy materials such as: Nylon, sieves, nails, etc. The loan will enable Narciso to continue producing his coffee in the best possible conditions which will allow him to choose the best markets for his coffee. Narciso wants to use this income from his coffee to improve his living conditions and make investments to help him produce better coffee and make his plantations more environmentally friendly."}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":5875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2027826,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Fair Trade"],"use":"to buy nylon, sieves, nails, wood and other materials he needs to build a solar-powered dryer for his certified coffee.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Capucas, San Pedro Cop\u00e1n, Honduras","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":448,"posted_date":"2015-11-23T17:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-23T17:10:07Z","loan_amount":5875,"lender_count":191,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#SustainableAg"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Trees"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Narcizo Obispo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":37,"loan_amount":5875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":37083.52},{"due_date":"2017-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":43016.88},{"due_date":"2018-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":49899.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1675.89},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1944.03},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2255.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-30T01:09:07Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janice Crossfield","image":null}},{"id":981285,"name":"Lhat's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lhat\u2019s Group lives in a rural village in Phnom Penh province, in Cambodia. <br \/><br \/>To support her family, Lhat makes a living cultivating rice and she also does extra work as a factory laborer. <br \/><br \/>In their village, there is no reliable access to safe, clean, drinking water.

The school does not currently have access to consistent, clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. <br \/><br \/>Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term, as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450-litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Kyeibare Girls School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

When he finishes his course he plans to transfer his credits to the university in order to specialize as an Electronic Engineer.\r\n\r\nThis course will allow him to build himself into a successful professional, which will help with the changes in his environment technologically, and with the economic well-being of his family. He still has 2 years left to be able to finish his studies.\r\n\r\nThe only obstacle he has encountered during his entire time studying is economic, because he cannot pay the monthly fees for his course. Due to this he is coming to KIVA so they can support him and he will meet his goal of being an excellent professional.

The internships do not pay very well; he only receives tips.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan requested from KIVA for the monthly payments for his course, since he will not run the risk of losing his studies due to lack of payment. The biggest dream he has in life is to be a designer in the electronics field, contribute to innovation, and make his country grow technologically.      \r\n\r\nChristian wants to say a few words to the KIVA members: \"I am very grateful to receive this support.
