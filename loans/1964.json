She travels mostly by road to South Africa, Botswana, and Mozambique to restock products such as clothing for males and females, young and old. She also restocks blankets, shoes, and different types of traveling bags. Additionally, she restocks plasticware like slippers, toys, dishes etc. from the central business district of Harare.<br \/><br \/>Sekai has a flea market located at a very busy shopping complex. Her flea market is always filled to maximum capacity with various clothing goods, plasticware, shoes, and bags. She has gained a lot of customer loyalty because her products are of high quality and are available in different colors, shapes, and sizes. <br \/><br \/>Sekai applied for a loan of $400 (her portion of the loan). With this amount, she intends to expand her operating space to increase the maximum capacity and to fully restock her flea market. This is to ensure that all different clients' needs are sufficiently met. She is also targeting the festive season, which is usually associated with massive spending. This season is when businesses will be at the peak as most families will be enjoying the fruits of their labor."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2028616,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to expand space for her sales and to restock clothes, shoes and other items ahead of the festive season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-11-24T00:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-24T00:10:05Z","loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#InterestingPhoto"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emmaculata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esnath","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sekai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nyarai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cleans","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2250,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-02T05:46:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dorothy Bendel","image":1215871}},{"id":981481,"name":"Nashat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nashat is 40, married, and has three children.

He is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2027411,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to store his maize at harvest time, then sell it later at a higher price.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-24T00:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-24T00:40:03Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kabiru","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":60204.09,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":60204.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Holly Pierce","image":518671}},{"id":983164,"name":"Fatima","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"A senhora Fatima de 37 anos de idade \u00e9 oper\u00e1ria agr\u1f77cola,  casada m\u00e3e 2 filhos todos a frequentar o ensino primario vive na casa pr\u00f3pria.\nCom o valor do empr\u00e9stimo pretende comprar areia, cimento, pedra, aros e janelas para dar inicio a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de sua casa tipo 1.\nPlanos para o futuro iniciar a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de sua casa  tipo 1 e com o passar do tempo ir ampliando para confortar a sua  familia.\nDiz que o seu maior desafio e a insufici\u00eancia de fundos e que para super\u00e1-los conta com ajuda de seu esposo e tamb\u00e9m faz machambas e que com o valor do emprestimo anterior legalizou o seu espa\u00e7o.\n","en":"Fatima is a 37-year-old farm worker.

They live in the Wawa Boom community, known for the Wawa River, which is located approximately 80 kilometers from the city of Bilwi, in the Puerto Cabezas municipality. They decided to name the communal bank El Lancho, because it is like an iron ferry that moves vehicles and the population from one side to the other of the mighty river, so they can reach the Puerto Cabezas and Waspam municipalities, and Tri\u00e1ngulo Minero in Caribe Norte. The members of the communal bank have placed wooden tables with umbrellas to protect them from the sun and rain on the left side of this ferry in order to be able to rely on their own source of income and to sell their fried meat products of chicken, pig, fish, and tamuga, carbonated drinks, sodas, and yucca and banana cakes.<br \/><br \/>Mary Lee is the coordinator of the communal bank. She is 39 years old, married, and has 7 children. Four are adolescents who attend elementary school in the community school of Wawa Boom, and three are underage.

This is Abdallah. He is the Director of Maisarah Islamic School, a mixed school in the urban area of Bwaise Kazo in Kampala with 350 students. Maisarah Islamic School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nMaisarah Islamic School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Abdallah ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2028793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-11-24T02:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-24T02:20:03Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maisarah Islamic School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3581300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":716260},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":716260},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":716260},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":716260},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":716260}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-27T04:54:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":981137,"name":"Mujeres Unidas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo llamado Mujeres Unidas est\u00e1 en su ciclo n\u00famero 3 del programa de comit\u00e9 de mujeres, es de la ciudad de Horqueta-Concepci\u00f3n, la cual es una zona de conflicto social, se encuentra en crecimiento por lo que las integrantes est\u00e1n esforz\u00e1ndose por mejorarla.\nLa Sra.

Masaudu is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":25,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2028751,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-24T05:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-24T05:30:02Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Masaudu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":28578.96,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":28578.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Morena Calvo","image":1832928}},{"id":981614,"name":"Jose Adan","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Jos\u00e9, es un publicista que emprendi\u00f3 su negocio hace aproximadamente 5 a\u00f1os, el cual es la principal fuente de ingresos para su familia, que est\u00e1 conformada por \u00e9l, su esposa y sus dos hijos, adem\u00e1s asegura que es un trabajo el cual disfruta mucho al realizarlo, porque conoce gente nueva y muy agradable.

Mamuda is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program.\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2028776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-24T07:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-24T07:20:05Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamuda","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":28165.69,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":28165.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Moody","image":null}},{"id":981595,"name":"Ma.

With Babban Gona\u2019s support, Yahaya will store the maize he harvests and delay its sale until later in the season when he can obtain a significantly higher price for his maize at a premium up to 37% more than the harvest price. \r\n\r\nWith the opportunity to earn up to $2,000 per hectare of land, Yahaya now has the opportunity to actualize his dream to grow his agriculture business for himself and family members and would like to use this additional income to build a house for his family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2028810,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-24T07:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-24T07:50:02Z","loan_amount":50,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yahaya","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":8765.8,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":50,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":8765.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-24T08:06:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Moody","image":null}},{"id":978392,"name":"Tujiunge Pamoja Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Julienne est soci\u00e9taire d\u2019un magasin des pi\u00e8ces de rechange depuis 7 ans, tr\u00e9sori\u00e8re de la banque communautaire Tujiunge Pamoja, cliente de l\u2019IMF Hekima, mari\u00e9e, \u00e2g\u00e9e de 41 ans, m\u00e8re de 4 enfants tous scolaris\u00e9s.

","en":"This is Uguloy. She is 30 and lives in the Muminobod region. She is a responsible and friendly woman who is pleasant to talk to. She lives with her husband, daughter, and son. Her daughter is only 7, her son is 5, and her husband is 35. Her husband is working abroad and she sews women's clothing to order, which she has been doing for many years. Uguloy applied for a loan because she wants to finish some repairs. She wasn't able to renovate one room, and the photo was taken in this room. The rest of the rooms have already been renovated, and Uguloy would like to take out a loan to repair the remaining room. She intends to purchase construction materials with the borrowed funds.

His mother died when he was young. His father managed to get his life back on track and now has a new partner. They all live together as a happy family.<br \/><br \/>Giorgio decided to study a course on clothes-making because he has always liked the world of fashion and he would like to follow a career path in this industry in the future.<br \/><br \/>He has a brother who is a model who can give him some support and push his designs. <br \/><br \/>This course will help him in many ways, both for the personal satisfaction in setting up his own business, and also economically as it will allow him to contribute to the family expenses. He also plans to help the community by offering work to those who show interest in what he is doing.<br \/><br \/>He has completed one year on a three-year course, which on completion will take him to the next stage in his life. He spends all his time practising with the machines, up to nine hours a day on practical work and then more time afterwards to study other things. <br \/><br \/>If he works for another company, he will only go to one which values his work and allows him to specialize in textiles. <br \/><br \/>Despite his love for his studies, he is faced with the problem of not having enough money to be able to continue working towards his dream. His father is unable to pay for it and he lost motivation at some point feeling that it was not possible to complete the course. <br \/><br \/>That is why he is asking for a loan from Kiva so he can carry on studying to be a successful businessman in the fashion industry. He would be very grateful for this assistance, as he learnt from his tutors that the more time he practises with the machines, the better he will become.  <br \/><br \/>His ultimate dream is to have his own business and be able to look after his family. He tells us: \"I feel very honored that many people want to offer me their support and I will strive every day to make the most of it. I will not let them down, so they won't regret aiding me. In fact, it will be a good investment, because I plan to offer my services in the future to those who are most at need.\""}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2028815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay to finish his studies as a tailor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":358,"posted_date":"2015-11-24T09:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-24T09:00:03Z","loan_amount":2300,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Single"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#InspiringStory"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Giorgio \u00cdtalo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2300,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":50,"loan_amount":2300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Walker","image":1333070}},{"id":981161,"name":"Nurali","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"   \u041d\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0438\u0437 \u0418\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0430 42 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u043e\u043d \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430. \u041d\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u044d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043c \u0441 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c. \u041a\u0430\u043a \u041d\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0430\u0441\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f. \u041d\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0431\u044b \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u043d\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u044d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442. \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0435, \u041d\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430, \u0434\u043e \u0432\u0437\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432\u043d\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432. \u041e\u043d \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a, \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f.","en":"Nurali is from Istaravshan.

She wants to give them a better life and enable them to finish their studies. To do this, she needs a bigger amount of loan to buy commodities that will help her augment her earnings. She needs to purchase items such as biscuits, candies, chips, bread, juice, fruits and school materials. Aside from this, she also wants to buy piglets. She is planning to start a hog-raising business.

It has a warm, tropical climate with a temperature of around 30 degrees centigrade.<br \/><br \/>Urbana is short and has long, black hair.  She has a sturdy build, and her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family.  She speaks Spanish with the general public and for her business.  She shares her life with her life partner, who works in the same business, and with their two minor children who go to school and work.  The rest of the children are independent and have their own families.  They live in rented quarters made of brick with a laminated tin roof.  They have running water, electricity, and indoor plumbing.<br \/><br \/>Her business is making mattresses from straw.  She starts her work at sunrise, seated at the side of the road by her house.  She supervises the arrival of the 'paja brava' [Bolivian straw material].  It is first cut from the hills of the mountains, and then the weaving is done.  It is then packed in a jute cover.  \"All of my life I have only used a straw mattress.  It is hard, comfortable, and I never get back or spinal pain,\" she says.<br \/><br \/>The advantage of her business is that the mattresses that she makes are inexpensive.  The disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy straw and jute wholesale.<br \/><br \/>Her dream is to open a mattress store.  <br \/><br \/>She wishes to buy straw and jute wholesale,  This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 20 years that she has been engaged in this business activity.
