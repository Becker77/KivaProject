She hopes to save some money for their education in the future.  \r\n\r\nShe has planned to improve her business. She thinks that if more products are sold that she can generate more income so that she can save some money for her children. Moreover there are demands from the customers for currently incomplete items such as rice, noodles, sugar, kerosene, and wheat. Therefore, along with 4 women Arni formed the Tunas Baru group and requested a loan totaling IDR 10,000,000 from Kiva through TLM.  She is thankful for Kiva who always focuses on the small entrepreneurs in the world.  She believes the loan will be beneficial for her business in the

Bernaditha and her husband operate their own hardware and construction store. She and her husband were helpers in a construction company until they were both laid off. Aware that they needed to support their children and their expenses, they decided to sell cement and sand using their last salary. They delivered the cement and sand to their customers themselves, oblivious to the backbreaking lifting of heavy materials, until such time that their hard work earned them more customers and they were able to hire a helper. \r\n\r\nAs of today, Bernaditha has 5 helpers with their own families to support and who depend on their wages. Bernaditha also helps her helpers by giving them an emergency allowance and health insurance. Bernaditha's construction store is her bread and butter, and although she wants to expand her business, construction supplies are expensive and she has no additional capital to supply all the demands of her customers.\r\n\r\nBernaditha is requesting a loan of PhP 150,000 to buy cement, sand, rock, pipes, steel and other construction supplies. She is very optimistic that with the loan they will be able to expand and have more construction supplies to deliver to her customers.\r\n\r\nBernaditha wants to see all her children finish their schooling, and more than that, she wants to help her neighbors have an opportunity to earn for their families' basic needs.

Benefiting from Babban Gona\u2019s marketing support, Cicilia has the opportunity to generate earnings of up to $2000 per hectare of land. \r\n\r\nCicilia is thankful that she no longer has to worry about having no money to increase her farmland and looks forward to using her additional earnings to build a house for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2029610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-24T17:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-24T17:50:04Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cicilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":22253.25,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":22253.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-24T19:01:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Darcy Palmer","image":551286}},{"id":981728,"name":"Ruben","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rub\u00e9n de 53 a\u00f1os de edad reside en vivienda propia al lado de su compa\u00f1era de vida y sus hijos de 8 y 14 a\u00f1os de edad. \u00c9l es un padre responsable quien para poder conseguir el pan de cada d\u00eda de su familia labora en una empresa cerca de su comunidad, labor que le permite satisfacer las necesidades b\u00e1sicas de su familia.

This was cultivated by her background at her church. As they grew up their church leaders encouraged and trained them to be involved in basic skills that could help them earn a living. Her determination enabled her to turn lemons into lemonade by crossing borders to restock groceries that were unavailable in supermarkets, selling to the people in Harare. <br \/><br \/>In the quest to be a businesswoman, Norest also started a small savings club with other women from her neighborhood in the year 2011. They named the club Vessels of Honour. In this club every member is self-employed and engaged in various business activities.<br \/><br \/>The cross-border business specializing in groceries gave her money to support her family. The economy stabilized after the introduction of a multi-currency system, and big grocery shops started operating. This led Norest to shift to selling jewelry and handbags to ladies. In addition, she sells meat to people around her neighbourhood. She is currently buying cattle and selling meat to people in companies and different households. <br \/><br \/>Together with her club members, she joined Thrive Microfinance for financial assistance training.

Dauda is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family, and looks forward to using his additional earnings to ensure that all his children get a post-secondary education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2029707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell his maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-24T19:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-24T19:50:18Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dauda","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":13512.31,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":13512.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-24T20:07:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":979330,"name":"Maodo's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Inaugurer en Octobre 2015 dans la place publique du village, ce banc villageois compte en son sein des femmes qui habitent le m\u00eame village et s\u2019appr\u00eatent \u00e0 entreprendre des activit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrices de revenu.

The school does not currently have consistent access to clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a water treatment system with a 450-liter tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Lusoose School will repay its loan from its school fees, which it collects each term.

Abigail is thankful that she now has the opportunity to improve the life of her children and family and looks forward to using her additional earnings to ensure that all her children get a post secondary education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1948433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-24T21:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-24T21:40:04Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abigail ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":17728,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":17728}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-24T22:07:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michael Angelilli","image":1331534}},{"id":982290,"name":"Vernhongkham Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phuthong is excited that the TerraClear water filter was available on an affordable payment plan.

She is 19 years old. In the rural areas and villages of Tajikistan girls get married early, and Manizha is not an exception. She got married at the command of her parents. However, her family life did not work out. Manizha returned to her parents' house. Currently Manizha is 19 years old and she has three small children on her hands, and a broken family life. She is recovering step by step and starting life anew. <br \/><br \/>Manizha's family has a small vineyard where she grows grapes. Currently she would like to plant onions too, by herself, and sell the harvest to help her family and not be a burden to her parents.
