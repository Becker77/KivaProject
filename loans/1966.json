He is married and his sales point is located in the center of the city of Baranquilla. There, he works every day from 9 am to 6 pm serving hundreds of passers-by and regular customers, as well as for the neighbors in the neighborhood where he also lives, he does deliveries of his products. Currently, he applied for a loan, a Kiva loan, an opportunity to become part of the financial world through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, to purchase a variety of fish: mojarra [sea bream], boccacio, catfish, tilapia, and others, since his capital isn't enough for him to have a more well-stocked inventory and through this loan he will manage to strengthen this weakness. In the future, John hopes to have other sales points to increase his income."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2028867,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Innovative Loans","Flexible Credit Study"],"use":"to purchase a variety of fish: mojarra [sea bream], boccacio, catfish, tilapia, and others.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2015-11-25T00:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-25T00:00:04Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"John Jairo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":740000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":83958},{"due_date":"2016-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":85737},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":88309},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":90958},{"due_date":"2016-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":93687},{"due_date":"2016-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":96497},{"due_date":"2016-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":99392},{"due_date":"2016-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":101462}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.36},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.97},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.83},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.73},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.65},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.6},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.58},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Wendy Harris","image":null}},{"id":981693,"name":"Marina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Marina, de 38 a\u00f1os de edad, logro estudiar hasta sexto grado, esta acompa\u00f1ada y su esposo es agricultor por cuenta propia y jornalero, tienen 4 hijos de los cuales solo 2 dependen econ\u00f3micamente de ellos, en su casa solo vive ella, su esposo y sus hijos.\n\nMarina, tiene un molino de nixtamal desde hace 1 a\u00f1o, esta actividad la aprendi\u00f3 con su esposo ya que el era el operador del molino de un hermano y ella decidi\u00f3 poner su propio molino para ayudarle a su esposo con los ingresos del hogar, anteriormente ella tenia una tienda frente a la escuela del cant\u00f3n pero ya no se pudo sostener por las pocas ventas, ahora adem\u00e1s de su molino ha iniciado nuevamente con la tienda esperando que la clientela que posee con el molino haga que crezca, estas actividades las realiza en su casa y su esposo le ayuda en con el negocio por las tardes despu\u00e9s de su trabajo.\n\nEl pr\u00e9stamo ser\u00e1 utilizado para comprar az\u00facar, arroz, aceite, gaseosa, etc. porque tiene muy poca variedad y hay muchos art\u00edculos por los que las personas de la comunidad le preguntan y ella no los tiene, al surtir su negocio estar\u00e1 mejorando los ingresos para su familia.\n\nMarina sue\u00f1a con volver a tener su tienda como en el pasado, para brindarle a su familia una mejor calidad de vida y ayudar a su esposo a que sus hijos terminen sus estudios, este deseo podr\u00e1 lograrlo con el pr\u00e9stamo, ya que estar\u00e1 incrementando sus ingresos.","en":"Marina, aged 38, studied up to sixth grade.

hopes of establishing a better life.  His partner started a business that imported Mexican goods to the United States and distributed them to supermarkets, and during this time, Agustin made connections with suppliers in Mexico.  <br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, Agustin had trouble getting the necessary work permits to own his own business in America.  It took many years, and he had to return to his native Mexico before coming back with the proper permits.<br \/><br \/>Eighteen months ago, Agustin finally made it back to America and immediately started his own business in Passaic.  Using the connections he made with suppliers in Mexico years ago, he started importing indigenous Mexican spices to northern New Jersey.  He then sold the spices to supermarkets and bodegas in Passaic and Paterson where there is a large Mexican population.  Agustin is very proud that he is able to help bring many of these immigrants a taste of home in the form of his spices.<br \/><br \/>As Agustin started to build his business, he found there was a big market for his spices.  He needed to expand, so he obtained warehouse space and started hiring members of the community to work for him.  While things were going well, Agustin repeatedly went to banks looking for loans to help him bring his business to the next level.  He kept getting declined because he had no prior credit history in the United States.  This reality has prevented Agustin from obtaining capital that will allow him to hire and serve more people.  <br \/><br \/>Agustin is looking for a Kiva loan to both build credit and to buy more spices in bulk so that in the future, he can continue to grow his business."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2030096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","themes":null,"use":"to build credit and purchase inventory in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Passaic","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":316,"posted_date":"2015-11-25T02:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-25T02:20:02Z","loan_amount":2650,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#JobCreator"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agustin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2650,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":206.05},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":208.63},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":211.24},{"due_date":"2016-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":213.88},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":216.55},{"due_date":"2016-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":219.26},{"due_date":"2016-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":222},{"due_date":"2016-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":224.78},{"due_date":"2016-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":227.58},{"due_date":"2016-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":230.43},{"due_date":"2016-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":233.31},{"due_date":"2016-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":236.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.05},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.63},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":211.24},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":213.88},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.55},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.26},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":222},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.78},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":227.58},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":230.43},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.31},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":236.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":982483,"name":"Elvia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvia and her husband are a very young couple.

With the opportunity to earn up to $2000 per hectare of land, Suleiman hopes to realize better yields and plans on using his additional income to build a house for his family."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2030597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-25T04:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-25T04:50:04Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Suleiman ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":33402.5,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":33402.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-27T23:33:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sue Tritt","image":null}},{"id":982365,"name":"Rigoberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Recorriendo las principales tiendas de su municipio es como Rigoberto distribuye sus productos de venta de curtidos, los cuales el mismo prepara todos los d\u00edas, para luego comercializarlos. \u00c9l tiene 35 a\u00f1os de edad y vive en casa de su propiedad desde hace 2 a\u00f1os, junto a su compa\u00f1era de vida y su grupo familiar.

He does his business in the town of \"Batallas\" (Battles) characterized by being situated on the shores of the sacred lake Titicaca.

The climate is cold and dry with a temperature ranging between 0 and 10 degrees Celsius during the day.<br \/> <br \/>Esteban is of dark complexion, with short black hair and a robust physique. His mother tongue is Aymara, which is spoken in the area, and he speaks Spanish in the common tongue and in his business. He shares his life with his wife, who is engaged in the same business. They live in their home built of adobe, which has electricity, but no water or sewage system because there is still no service in this area.<br \/> <br \/>His business is the making of shoes for cholitas; a cholita is a traditionally dressed Bolivian woman (wearing a hat, blanket, and skirt) and their shoes are characterized by being short and without heels, although the models vary according to the season and fashion.  \"The way to dress as a \"cholita pace\u00f1a\" (a traditionally dressed Bolivian woman, specifically from La Paz) has changed with the years.

She started this business because her previous job didn\u2019t give her the chance to live with her family and was really exhausting.  \r\n\r\nOver the years Gabriela acquired a solid customer base.  Her business is a small grocery store where she sells a wide variety of products.  Nevertheless, Gabriela has always wanted her business to be better off and because of this, she asked for a loan.  The money from the loan she requested has helped her to buy more merchandise so that her sales can increase and her earnings can improve.  With this loan, she managed to start selling fragrances, office supplies, and toys in her store.\r\n\r\nHer goal in business is to achieve an increase in sales and earnings, which will give her greater benefits in her professional and personal life."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2030207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more merchandise so her sales can increase and her earnings can improve","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Coahuila","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":401,"posted_date":"2015-11-25T17:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-25T17:00:07Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1606.81},{"due_date":"2015-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1630},{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1653.59},{"due_date":"2016-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1677.57},{"due_date":"2016-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1701.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1730.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.43},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.87},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.35},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.85},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.37},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-25T18:30:51Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Patton"}},{"id":981831,"name":"Akylai","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0410\u043a\u044b\u043b\u0430\u0439, 28 \u043b\u0435\u0442, \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, 2 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435, \u043f\u043e \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0432\u0435\u0436\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f. \u0410\u043a\u044b\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c. \u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044f \u0443\u043f\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u0410\u043a\u044b\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0435\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e 13,000 \u0441\u043e\u043c (KGS) \u0432 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0446. \u0412 \u0445\u043e\u0437\u044f\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c 2 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b. \u041d\u0430 0,59 \u0413\u0430 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0443\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0443. \u0412 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0445 \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430, \u0410\u043a\u044b\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0432 \u0411\u0430\u043d\u043a \u00ab\u0411\u0430\u0439 \u2013\u0422\u0443\u0448\u0443\u043c\u00bb \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0432 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043c\u0435 100,000 \u0441\u043e\u043c (KGS) \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0443 5 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0438. \u0414\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044b \u043e\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u0410\u043a\u044b\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u0435 \u0443\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430.","en":"Akylai is 28 years old, married, and has two children.

intended. She is grateful to Kiva and to everyone who supported her. On her farm she has three cows, 30 sheep, and four horses. She grows clover for the farm on her 1.8 hectare plot. In the winter the animals are kept in the barn, and in the summer they go out to pasture. Her monthly income is approximately 31,000 KGS.

With Babban Gona\u2019s support, Samaila will store the maize he harvests and delay its sale until a date later in the season when he can obtain a significantly higher price for his maize, at a premium up to 37% more than the harvest price.<br \/><br \/>With the opportunity to earn up to $2,000 per hectare of land, Samaila now has the opportunity to actualize his dream to grow his agriculture business for himself and family members. He would like to use this additional income to purchase a motorbike and do business with it."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":25,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2026585,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-25T17:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-25T17:50:09Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samaila","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":36153.31,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":36153.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie Bradshaw","image":1722852}},{"id":979476,"name":"Johannes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Johannes, 56, is married and has four children.

She operates her own sari-sari store (a Filipino-coined term for a small variety store) for a living. The store is occupying a small space of their humble house in Cavite. Operating for many years now, she has managed to keep the business running and growing.<br \/><br \/>At some point, she experienced a lack in needed capital to buy her products because she would have to compromise her funds to pay their bills. Instead of buying groceries, she would have to consider the household needs first, what they have to eat for the day, the payment for the electricity and water, etc. There are also instances when neighbors would not pay their bills on time, causing her business to suffer.<br \/><br \/>Fe has been faithful in her responsibilities and once again she is knocking on the hearts of the ever supportive lenders. By borrowing supporting capital, she believes this could resolve her inadequacies in business. She hopes to improve her inventory by adding more grocery items like assorted groceries, beverages, office supplies and other common commodities. She is applying for a loan amount of Php 20,000 and praying that her request will be granted.
