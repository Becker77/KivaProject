a way of generating income, Teresita has been engaged in cooking and selling street foods in her community for almost two years now. She is 43 years of age and blessed with four children. Her husband, Alvin, works as a market collector and they work hand-in-hand to provide for their needs.<br \/><br \/>In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings when all of the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.<br \/><br \/>Teresita plans to build her own stall since she is still renting a space, but she doesn't have enough capital. For this reason, she would like to avail herself of a loan amounting to 50,000 PHP (Philippines pesos) to buy additional raw products like pork and chicken and seasonings that are needed. Being a kind and friendly mother, she is hoping that she will further improve the business through this financial assistance.<br \/><br \/>Teresita dreams of building and expanding her business to secure the future of her family. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God she studies.<br \/><br \/>*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

Before joining Babban Gona, Eli would have had to sell her maize at harvest, when the price of maize is at its lowest, to meet her immediate cash needs such as food and clothing. As a Babban Gona member, Eli can store the maize she harvests and delay its sale until a period later on in the season, when she can obtain the best price for her maize, at a premium of up to 37% higher than the market price at harvest. Thanks to the support from Babban Gona\u2019s marketing services, Eli no longer feels the pressure to sell her maize at low harvest prices.

It is, of course, Manuel's responsibility to keep the apartment in good living condition, and at this time he doesn't have the money to make improvements to the apartment. For this reason he has applied for a Kiva loan, which is one way to link up to the financial offerings of the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation and to carry out this project. \r\nWith these resources, Manuel will finance the purchase of materials such as paint, stucco, plumbing and tile, and will also pay laborers for the work. \r\nManuel is an older gentleman who wants to spend his later years in good health and in peace. He will be able to achieve this goal very soon thanks to this loan, which will improve the look of his apartment.

Finishing school he hadn\u2019t a chance to enter university, so started to work. But having worked in the summer, he understood that will not earn enough money for living. This reason forced him to think on his next steps and make a decision to get high education. <br \/><br \/>He began to search for scholarships and found out AUCA\u2019s 1-year-study New Generation Academy, which provided full scholarship, stipend and accommodation for the selected 70 best students\/graduates of schools. As Asylbek was a diligent student at school and had good marks, he was blessed and selected as a finalist. During 2014-15 AY he moved to Bishkek to study at this Academy and got acquainted with the modern education system in English, improving his critical thinking and computer skills.<br \/><br \/>At present Asylbek is a freshman and has to pay for his tuition fee by himself. He applied for financial aid and got it from AUCA, but still the rest of the fee is too high for him. Asylbek has a mother and his younger brother at home. His mother is a nurse at the local hospital. The budgetary workers in Kyrgyzstan have a small salary, what is hardly enough for living there, but not to support a student in the capital as Bishkek. <br \/><br \/>Searching for education loans, Asylbek was happy to learn about Kiva loan for AUCA students, which was a deferred payment with zero interest and that could be returned after graduation. If Asylbek gets higher education and finds a good job in the future, he will be a great help for his mother to bring up his younger brother, who is a school-boy now.

Anticipating a good harvest this season, Abdulrauf has the opportunity to attain yields of up to 8 Metric Tonnes of Maize per Hectare of Land, 5.5 times that of the average Nigerian maize farmer. \nBefore joining Babban Gona, Abdulrauf would have had to sell his maize at harvest, a period when maize prices are at their lowest in the market, to meet his immediate cash needs such as food and clothing. Thanks to Babban Gona\u2019s support Abdulrauf can store his maize and sell it at a future date for up to 37% higher than the market price at harvest. \nAs a Babban Gona member, Abdulrauf will benefit from marketing support that could see him generate earnings of up to $2000 per hectare of land. Abdulrauf is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2030125,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-26T00:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-26T00:40:09Z","loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdulrauf ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":61360.6,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":2,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":61360.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-26T03:07:34Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":983200,"name":"Alberto","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alberto is a 52-year-old man from Tubigon, Bohol.

People hire him to build their homes and for all kinds of remodeling projects.
