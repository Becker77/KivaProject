His business is successful because he provides service 24 hours a day. The advantage of his business he that he is close to the road. The downside is that he lacks lubricants and working materials to help with inconveniences. <br \/><br \/>His dream is to improve his income and expand the tools for his business. He wants to buy lubricants on wholesale. This is his first sequence of loans with the institution in the 9 years that he has been in business. It is for these reasons that Wilson is requesting a loan to buy lubricants to help with transport for the tourists who travel around the area."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2032228,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy lubricants to help with transport for the tourists who travel around the area.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-11-26T20:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-26T20:30:02Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":535.34},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":460.44},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":498.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":527.31},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":527.81},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":570.66},{"due_date":"2016-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":583.12},{"due_date":"2016-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":608.72},{"due_date":"2016-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":639.26},{"due_date":"2016-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":657.71},{"due_date":"2016-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":698.32},{"due_date":"2016-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":692.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.39},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.42},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.97},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.21},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.29},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.56},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.39},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.13},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.61},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.31},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.25},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cristina Bleicher","image":1721919}},{"id":983786,"name":"Areej","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Areej entered the perfume selling market in Chouf three years ago.

In the picture, she stands first from the right. Phuong is married and has an 18-year-old son. She lives with her husband and son in an old Thai ethnic traditional house in a small, remote village of a poor mountainous province where people mainly rely on small-scale agricultural production. Phuong did not have the chance to study or receive a good education, so she is illiterate. She doesn't want her son to be the same so she works very hard to send him to school so that he may study and have a good future. <br \/><br \/>Phuong and her husband work in farming and animal husbandry. They grow rice and breed pigs, fish, chicken and ducks. This is the third time that Phuong has taken out a loan from the Anh Chi Em program.

She has four children. She is divorced and provides for her children (22, 20, 18, and 16 years of age) on her own. Two of her children are university students; the third one has started high school, and the youngest is in a private school. She owns the house she lives in. Monique's goal is to build a house which will be rented out, to become a wholesaler of first necessity products and do everything to help her children finish their studies successfully.\r\n\r\nMonique opened her general store in 2012.

She sells her products as a street vendor in the southern area of the city, which is known for housing the main part of the population and for its manufacturing production. <br \/><br \/>Gabriela is of dark complexion with dark-brown hair that she wears long, and a thin physique (she's in the middle of the photo wearing a pink shirt and a jean miniskirt). Her native language is Guaran\u00ed, which she only speaks in family gatherings. She uses Spanish at work.  She shares her life with her children who are not yet of school age.  They live in a room owned by the family, constructed of brick, and have potable water, electricity and plumbing.  <br \/><br \/>The need to improve her business led her to head up a communal bank.  The businesses of the members improved.  They were able to buy raw materials and pay for their inventory.  Her business is the sale of items through catalogs such as plastic products (containers, bottles, tupperware, etc.) and cosmetics (such as lipsticks, nail polish and perfumes).  \"I began a micro enterprise, with a great desire to work and have my own business, and above all to be able to sell, which is what I like, without neglecting my small children,\" she says.  Her business is successful because it offers convenient payment plans so that her customers continue to buy.  The advantage of her business is that the majority of her sales are from orders.  The disadvantage is the lack of capital to buy merchandise and sell it on credit.  <br \/><br \/>Her dream is to provide schooling and well being to her 2 children.  She wants to buy catalog merchandise wholesale to sell on credit and through other forms of payment.  This is the 3rd sequence of loans with the institution in the 2 years that she has worked in this business.  For these reasons Gabriela seeks a loan to buy catalog merchandise to sell on credit and to offer other forms of payment."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2032145,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy catalog merchandise to sell on credit and to provide other forms of payment.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-11-26T23:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-26T23:40:02Z","loan_amount":5325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#SingleParent"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eloina               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marco Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ysabel                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yobana            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edgar Valent","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":36500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":5325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2268.96},{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2357.72},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2400.62},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2444.31},{"due_date":"2016-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":2488.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2534.1},{"due_date":"2016-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2580.22},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2627.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":2675},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":2723.68},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2773.25},{"due_date":"2016-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2823.72},{"due_date":"2016-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2875.12},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2927.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":331.02},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":343.97},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350.23},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":356.6},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":363.09},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":369.7},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":376.43},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":383.28},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":390.26},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":397.36},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":404.59},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":411.95},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":419.45},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":427.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Hiller","image":null}},{"id":983864,"name":"Rosa Marleni","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa cuenta con 42 a\u00f1os de edad y habita en casa de su propiedad junto a su hijo de 13 a\u00f1os de edad.

He and his wife have had years of sacrifice to build the home in which they now live. <br \/><br \/>However, the budget ran low at the end and they could not finish the bathroom. This leaves the family in a complicated situation as they bathe outside or sometimes in the neighbor's shower, and they use an improvised latrine in the backyard. The family has been living like this for a year. They are ready to do what is needed to complete the house and provide a better life for all members.<br \/><br \/>As Jose Carlos's job is informal and he does not receive a regular income, getting credit from other institutions is very difficult. With the credit he is requesting, Jose Carlos and his oldest son Saul (shown in the picture) will work to build and properly install the bathroom. They will receive assistance and supervision from certified technicians to make sure the work is properly done and that it meets all the safety and quality standards. When this work is completed,  the family will then be able to lead a healthier lifestyle."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2032199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to provide his family with better hygiene and a better life by completing installation of their bathroom.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Salvador El Seco, Puebla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":301,"posted_date":"2015-11-27T00:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-27T00:30:06Z","loan_amount":2425,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Carlos Guadalupe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1177},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1211.12},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1246.23},{"due_date":"2016-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1282.35},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1319.53},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1357.79},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1397.14},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1437.65},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1479.33},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1522.22},{"due_date":"2016-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1566.34},{"due_date":"2016-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1611.76},{"due_date":"2016-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1658.48},{"due_date":"2017-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1706.56},{"due_date":"2017-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1756.04},{"due_date":"2017-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1806.95},{"due_date":"2017-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1859.34},{"due_date":"2017-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1913.25},{"due_date":"2017-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1968.72},{"due_date":"2017-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2025.8},{"due_date":"2017-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2084.53},{"due_date":"2017-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2144.97},{"due_date":"2017-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2207.16},{"due_date":"2017-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2259.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.36},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.42},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.55},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.74},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.32},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.7},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.16},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.68},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.28},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.96},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.71},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.55},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.46},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.46},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.55},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.72},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.99},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.35},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.81},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.38},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.04},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":133.81},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null}]}
