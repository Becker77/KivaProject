old, married and raising four children together with her husband. She has secondary education. As a main income for her family she works with livestock breeding, after having started a business with the purchase of livestock for 20,000 som (KGS). Thanks to Aitkul's persistent work, her farm currently has three cows and 30 sheep.

She resides with her husband and family. She has been actively involved in farming for the past five years and has never regretted it or looked back. She practices mixed farming and sells milk, eggs, and various food crops at the local market. Annette passionately loves poultry farming, but the biggest challenge she faces is a lack of capital to buy quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs. \r\n\r\nAnnette is seeking a loan to purchase additional poultry. She will use her excess maize to feed the poultry and will provide sorghum to give the poultry energy and green grams (beans) for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs that are of good quality, which will translate to more income.

She has won the trust of her husband's family with her industriousness. They love her very much, like they would their own daughter. \r\n\r\nKomila's family raises cattle. She milks cows. She makes dairy products from the milk herself, such as kefir, smetana, and tvorog, and sells it. She makes a living through this. Komila's husband Gulom also is a wonderful person. He works as a farmer and cultivates vegetables and feed for the cattle. This year Gulom received a good harvest, and after sales he received a good income. \r\n\r\nHaving consulted with their family about this money, they have decided to increase their cattle headcount and do animal husbandry in the winter. But with their savings they will be able to buy only a pair of cattle. They do not have enough funds, thus Komila has applied to MDO Arvand for a loan.

","en":"Nigora is a hardworking woman, aged 38. She was born in a family of farmers and always helped her parents on the farm because she was the eldest child. Since childhood she has been accustomed to working. After finishing high school she passed the entrance exams for university in order to get a higher education, but it did not work out and she was not able to enroll. She had a strong spirit and began to improve her knowledge on her own. She found a job in order to help her parents take care of the family. She worked for almost a year and then got married. Now Nigora is a beloved wife and a caring mother of three children. Nigora's husband loads cargo at the train station and earns enough to support the family, but Nigora also sews traditional dresses and has a small shop with clients and students. She has been saving the money she earns from sewing for renovations to their house and began paying for repairs with this money. She was not able to complete the renovations because the price of goods went up and she did not have enough money. When she heard about \"green loans\" she applied for one with MDO Arvand. After receiving the loan she will complete the repairs and install modern plastic windows and doors. Nigora thanks Arvand for their useful and timely support.

Tarmary also ensures that she prepares adequate home cooked meals so that she can eat along the way since she is not a fan of fast foods which are usually the main menu along the roads. <br \/><br \/>Tarmary is married and has 4 children who all go to school.

Tarmary is in the clothing and footwear business and she mainly restocks shoes for both genders and for different occasions. She buys clothing like golf t-shirts, normal t-shirts and men\u2019s jeans.

They have four children, ages 9, 10, 16, and 19 years old. She is in the business of selling undergarments.<br \/><br \/>She is resolute, constant, and very hard-working. She runs her business in the 'Plan 3000' neighborhood, one of the most populous in the city; it's where the survivors of the Pira\u00ed flood in 1983 came. The people in this crowded area are largely migrants from other cities and from the country.<br \/><br \/>Yaquelin has brown skin, short stature, and medium build - in the picture, she's the first on the left, wearing a blue shirt. Her native language is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks with her family, and she speaks Spanish with people generally and while running her business. She shares her life with her partner, who works in construction, and with her children, who are in school. They live in a rented room made of bricks, and have water, electricity, and waste water services.<br \/><br \/>The drive to get ahead led her to form a bank for the undertaking. The members run a variety of businesses, including selling clothes, selling food, selling natural medicines, making curtains, baking bread, selling soft drinks, and running a automotive shocks shop.<br \/><br \/>Her business is selling ladies' undergarments, including tshirts, shorts, body suits, thermal underwear, corsets, camisoles, bras, garter belts, and more. \"A lot of times, we don't think about our underwear because we think that nobody is going to see us. But that's a mistake because we should be beautiful for ourselves,\" she commented.<br \/><br \/>Her business is successful because the merchandise she sells is varied. One advantage of her business is that she can rely on steady customers; one disadvantage is that she lacks capital to supply her business. Her goal is strengthen her business; she wants to buy women's undergarments to do that. This is her first loan sequence with the institution in the two years that she's been running this business.<br \/><br \/>It's for all these reasons that Yaquelin is requesting this loan, which she will use to buy women's underwear and supply her business for the end-of-year parties."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2033455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"buy women's undergarments to strengthen her business for New Year's parties","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-11-27T17:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-27T17:50:02Z","loan_amount":3425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moises","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaquelin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela Andrea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juanita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3525.13},{"due_date":"2016-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3714.54},{"due_date":"2016-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3849.75},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3989.88},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":4135.12},{"due_date":"2016-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4285.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":513.77},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":541.38},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":561.08},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":581.5},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":602.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":624.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Skoglund","image":836314}},{"id":984347,"name":"Hanin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hanin is a 27-year-old Lebanese single woman.
