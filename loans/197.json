All my life is dedicated to working and helping my family, I cook and eat in the store.\n\nMy biggest accomplishment is taking care of my daughter and buying a car, that I lease and receive additional income.\n\nI am responsible and even after going through dificult times, I keep fighting an dpaying my loans.

works tirelessly to give her two school age daughters a better life. She has always worked toward building a sustainable future. From a young age she has been involved in sales, and for the last 20 years she has sold fodder (animal feed) and alfalfa for farm animals such as Guinea pigs and rabbits, among others.  She does this job together with her husband, working as a team. In the beginning, she worked as a reseller, purchasing lots of alfalfa and reselling them in the local market. Thanks to her enthusiasm and the advice of some friends, she was able to obtain an alfalfa field so that she could grow her own product. Her business has now grown in spite of the fact that in some respects the business does not offer the same profitability that it once did.

Her wish is to help herself and to be able to enjoy her old age, given that her children live far from her and have their own families. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":289699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To acquire more sheep, fatten them, and sell them.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno, Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-03-20T08:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":278.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590728},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:26:40Z","rounded_local_amount":278.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52984991}],"funded_date":"2009-03-20T09:51:56Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:26:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariela Cede\u00f1o","image":883126}},{"id":100024,"name":"Djiguis\u00e8m\u00e8 (\"hope\") Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe  Djiguis\u00e8m\u00e8  de l\u2019association Dembagnouman est compos\u00e9 de six femmes.

P. es un se\u00f1or de 57 a\u00f1os de edad. Vive con su esposa y un ahijado  en una comunidad llamada, El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Provincia de Cartago.  Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nDesde hace varios meses que Don Mario  se dedica a la cr\u00eda de pollos para engorde y gallinas ponedoras para la producci\u00f3n de carne y huevos, el vende sus productos a los vecinos de su comunidad los cuales se muestran muy satisfechos. El dice que tener el apoyo y la ayuda de su esposa le facilita seguir con el proyecto. Adem\u00e1s dice que el proyecto le es muy interesante   ya que ha visto como poco a poco su negocio crece y la demanda cada vez es m\u00e1s fuerte.\n\nActualmente don Mario est\u00e1 solicitando un micro cr\u00e9dito de \u00a2500.000 (quinientos mil colones) para la compra de m\u00e1s pollos y gallinas; concentrado, y productos para el tratamiento de enfermedades; adem\u00e1s de ampliar y reforzar su local.

He lives with his wife and godson in a community called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, in the province of Cartago.  It is a small, rural community with approximately two thousand residents.  Its inhabitants work in milk production and planting coffee. It has an irregular landscape and much of the land is kept as a tropical rain forest. The community has picturesque landscapes that combine the rain forest with two beautiful lagoons, coffee plantations and creameries. El Sauce is located approximately an hour and a half by bus to Turrialba, the closest commercial center.  Nevertheless, a few times a year the route becomes impassable because of the rains that hit the zone. This is without doubt one of the main challenges for the community.\r\n\r\nWhen there weren't any activities many people chose to leave and look for work in Turrialba in the banana farms located in the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica. Currently the price of milk and coffee have improved, therefore the residents are looking for how to invest in local projects and avoid migrating.\r\n\r\nFor the past few months don Mario has worked on fattening up chickens and laying hens for the production of meat and eggs.  He sells his products to the community residents who are very satisfied.  He says that having the support and the help of his wife helps him continue with the project.  Even more he says that the project interests him since he has seen his business grow bit by bit and demand is getting stronger. \r\n\r\nCurrently don Mario is asking for a micro-credit of \u00a2500.000 (five hundred thousand colones) to buy more chickens and hens, concentrate, and products for treating sicknesses, in addition to expanding and reinforcing his premises. With this he hopes to grow his business even more and improve his quality of life.  He business is going well, but he hasn't been able to grow because of underfunding.  With the loan that he is asking for he hopes to increase sales and thereby improve the economic condition of his family.\r\n\r\nDon Mario is a member of the Sauce Production Association, one of 100 organizational members of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be his fifth loan and with him EDESA hopes to continue to grow on a personal and economic level, along with actively participating in the credit organization in its community. \r\n\r\n<br

She lives in the city of Lamas, in Lamas province, Department of San Mart\u00edn.  She is 35 years old and lives with her common-law husband and her son, who is in school.\r\n \r\nFor many years now Rossana has made a living through farming.  She tells us that she started out by planting banana trees on her own farm.\r\n \r\nRossana personally takes charge of caring for her banana trees, but she hires agricultural workers to help her plant and harvest the bananas.  She started out with 300.00 soles and gradually saved her money.  Currently her farm has more than two hundred banana trees; bananas are a product that families here in the rainforest consume daily.\r\n \r\nShe will use this loan of 3,000.00 soles to purchase more banana trees, along with a special fertilizer that will improve the bananas' growth.  She will also invest part of the money in paying the agricultural workers who help her to harvest the bananas, since every month they pick from 80 to 100 bunches of bananas.\r\n\r\nOne of Rossana's dreams and aspirations is to set up a large grocery store so that she can generate more income and continue contributing to the household income.\r\n\r\nRossana now feels that she is a very accomplished woman who wants to achieve and make her dreams a reality.  She is grateful for the help that the Manuela Ramos organization gave her in starting her business, along with the many other women who want to grow their businesses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christopher Knutson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":338330,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing banana trees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-06-22T13:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rossana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:24:54Z","rounded_local_amount":502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52985539},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:15:08Z","rounded_local_amount":502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205959},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:48:07Z","rounded_local_amount":502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635211},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:45:33Z","rounded_local_amount":502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074276},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989652},{"amount":166.65,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":502.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103834639}],"funded_date":"2009-06-22T14:54:13Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:41:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Knutson","image":1448752}},{"id":120504,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa es socia del Banco Comunal Paloma.\nRosa es casada, tiene 60 a\u00f1os y 5 hijos, Rosa tiene una tienda en su casa en donde vende abarrotes en general, verduras, frutas, bebidas, actividad que realiza todos los d\u00edas con la ayuda eventual de sus hijos.\nRosa necesita un pr\u00e9stamo de 2000 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra de arroz, az\u00facar y bebidas.\nLos sue\u00f1os de Rosa son ampliar su local, aumentar su negocio e hijos sean profesionales.\n","en":"Rosa is a member of the Paloma Community Bank.

To make a living, Alma owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale.

Alma is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Alma from PMPC.

With the help of her past 2 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Zyndel Marie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting her family's standard of living.  This time, for her 3rd loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to buy more stocks for the store so that she can continue to save up for future improvements of her business.\r\n\r\n Zyndel Marie is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Dengan modal pakan perhari Rp.10.000.- keuntungan selama 6 bulan dari 3 ekor babi sebesar Rp. 900.000,-Keuntungan ini sangat membantu biaya rumah tangganya. Karena suaminya, Putu Yasa, hanya sebagai sopir yang mendapat upah tidak menentu dan hanya tergantung dari orderan. Jika ada orderan maka suaminya akan mendapatkan penghasilan.

He is a man who from an early age was characterized as a hard-worker who is very dedicated to his agricultural work, raising cattle. He saw this as an activity that would enable him to have additional income due to the high demand for these animals in the markets. The challenge is to improve the breed, but in order to do so he has to feed them properly. <P>\r\n\r\nNazirboy has the best intentions for his children, and this allows him to continue improving as a father and farmer. This farmer yearns to expand his business so that he will be able to improve his family's standard of living. In order to do so he is asking for a loan that will allow him to buy animals of a better breed in order to improve the quality of his herd. \r\n<P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Es por eso que le prop\u00f3sito de Mirna es comprar lo suficiente para abastecer la demanda. Y es as\u00ed como solicita este financiamiento destinado para capital de trabajo y as\u00ed movilizarse hasta Managua o Chinandega ya que es aqu\u00ed donde es favorable la compra de ropa usada. Los sue\u00f1os de Mirna son de establecer una tienda de ropa usada con un excelente inventario.","en":"Mirna Apariza G\u00f3mez M. is 58 years old and married. Mirna has 4 children and they all work. Mirna has been selling used clothing for more than 3 years. She is a street vendor, and began her business on her own after working as a teacher and her salary didn\u2019t cover all her household expenses so she decided to sell used clothing. Mirna plans on buying sufficient inventory to meet her demand. She is seeking financing for working capital to be able to travel to Managua or Chanindega where the prices for used clothing are more favorable.

In her last loan, she borrowed 22,000 Philippine pesos, which she invested in the vulcanizing shop managed by her husband. It is now earning PHP 5,000 per month.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She began with her own savings as an itinerant saleswoman of atole (drink made of cornflour) and sweets in the capital's urban routes.  It was difficult work but she had to generate income because her husband's earnings weren't sufficient to provide schooling, clothing and food for four children.  Thanks to God, she would sell out of everything.  In time, she was able to start to sell sweets from her home and little by little it grew into a small general store which, thanks to loans from Afodenic, she was able to strenghthen still more until today.  Her four children are students and her husband is a driver.  Her plan is to be able to continue to make improvements to her home.  With this loan she will stock up on rice, beans, sugar, oil, soap, sweets, dairy products, among other items, which are typical of Nicaraguan cuisine.  She hopes to improve sales since they have been low these past few months which has led to net losses rather than profits.  What has helped her to stay afloat is that she rents two rooms which produce a fixed monthly income with which she can pay basic utilities, among other expenses.  She is happy with the institution for making it possible to improve both her business and her personal life.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":427951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To stock up on rice, beans, sugar, oil, and sweets.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-17T00:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1083.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":1166.72,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:51:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1207.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003226},{"amount":54.89,"local_amount":1097.89,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1136.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841381},{"amount":113.25,"local_amount":2265.07,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2345.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874296},{"amount":52.16,"local_amount":1043.26,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1080.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639655},{"amount":117.79,"local_amount":2355.84,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2439.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821431},{"amount":97.03,"local_amount":1940.54,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2009.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770403},{"amount":53.75,"local_amount":1075.03,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1113.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204302},{"amount":102.79,"local_amount":2055.65,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2128.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465261}],"funded_date":"2009-12-10T02:04:58Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T11:43:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":157590,"name":"Formando Un Futuro Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"ALCOM \u201cFORMANDO UN FUTURO\u201d\n\nFormando un Futuro es un grupo que vive en San Juan D.

Lurigancho and is maD. up of persons who have overcome problems as big as abandonment.  For example:  Hilaria, 55, has learned to overcome heavy blows in life.  She was abandoned as a very young girl and had to roam the streets begging for food until she met a woman who became fond of her and helped her with food and clothing.  Still, Hilaria had to work.  Hilaria grew based on toil and, by the age of 14, had exacting jobs.  One of them was as a dishwasher in a restaurant.  At 15, she met the man who would become her partner and father of her two daughters.  He was employed as a municipal trash collector, a job that barely earned him enough income to eat.  Years passed and when their eldest daughter was 12 years old and the youngest was 6, Hilaria suffered another abandonment; this time by her partner.  He abandoned her to her fate, with two daughters.  Hilaria now had to be both mother and father and started working again.  She began selling candy, then popsicles and ice-cream.  Later it was food, prepared meals and at night, sweets and cookies that she peddled from a basket that she carried through the streets.  After 25 years, her ex-partner and father of their daughters, returned but only because he was crippled.  Their daughters were unaffected by this turn of events because they were independent by this time with families of their own.  Now, Hilaria's partner helps out with what he can, like tending to the business, etc.  Currently, Hilaria has a small kiosk which the city allows her to use to sell sweets, candies, beverages, etc. and she also has a small ice-cream vending cart for Donofrio brand items and she has traveling phone booths.  She is a strong woman who has dreams like so many other women in this society.  She tells us with a smile \"my dream is to finish my home and to have a store in it so that I can work without having to leave my house because what I most enjoy is work and, if I could work from home, that would be even better for me\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3375,"image":{"id":436590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Juan de Lurigancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:01:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3375,"lender_count":92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilaria Elsa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Serafina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herlinda Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda Aurelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Restituta Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladis Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Natividad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelo Miquiar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2425},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2425},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2425},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2425}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":843.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":843.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":843.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":843.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":3375,"local_amount":9700,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:32Z","rounded_local_amount":9720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669130}],"funded_date":"2009-12-28T19:57:49Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T12:46:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":161733,"name":"Letecia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Letecia A. is from the town of Sulipat, Calamba Misamis Occidental.

For the past five years, he has been selling fruit as his main source of income.  In the past few months, he has noticed a rise in the price of fruit, which has made it difficult for him to purchase more merchandise.  This is the reason why he is applying for a loan, so that he can buy a larger inventory of fruit, which would then increase his sales due to the high demand that occurs during the summer months.  With the warmer climate, his clients tend to purchase more fruit and he wants to be able and ready to take full advantage of this tendency.  The help that he is asking for would help him in reaching this objective and thus adding to the socio-economic stability of his family.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tracy

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  a fruits & vegetables business and a charcoal & wood business.  Her husband Jeoffrey, who is 37 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living.  They have four children who are between 1 and 6 years old. \r\n\r\nLordita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 8 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lordita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 9th loan, Lorida is borrowing PHP 16,000, which she intends to use to buy more stocks of fruits to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Lordita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is married and the very-devoted father of two children. For the last eight years, he has made a living as a farmer. He works with his wife, and sells his produce in local markets.

He is committed to increase his profits, buy a home in town and provide his children with a good life. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being the home of a key post along the Silk Road and the place where the rule of Alexander the Great ended. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only seven percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She sells used clothing on the streets in the Kitintale village of Kampala early each morning to late in the evening.  Three times a week she takes public transportation to the Owino market, Kampala\u2019s busiest wholesale exchange, to buy bales of second-hand clothes.<p>\r\n\r\nThis is Specioza\u2019s first loan with BRAC.  She will use the proceeds to purchase bales of bulk used clothing in larger quantities to lock in a lower cost and expand her inventory for the busy festive (Holiday) buying season.  She makes less than 20,000 Ush a day.<p>\r\n\r\nIncreasing her revenue and profit are important to Specioza, as she provides the family\u2019s only income.  School fees are 300,000 Ush per term.  Including books and school supplies, school cost Specioza over 1,000,000 Ush per year.  Paying school fees in addition to other living costs makes it difficult to feed her children two meals in a day when sales are down.<p>\r\n\r\nSpecioza\u2019s dream is to educate her children to the university level, earn enough to begin a savings account, and to open her own clothing boutique to relieve the physical burden of carrying a heavy bag all day.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":228614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

this loan of 70,000 CFA will be his second since joining the organization in 2007.  He and his family have faced many of life's challenges, like continuous health issues, death of loved ones, first family business failing, but with the help of Kiva and GHAPE, Calson is able to create a better life for him and his family.\r\n\r\nCalson will use this current loan to purchase fertilizer, additional seedlings to expand his crops, transportation of his produce and pesticides.  Because some of his crops are almost ready to harvest, Calson is hopeful that his farming business will continue to do well.  In addition, because he needs additional labor to work his land, he is helping his community by creating employment opportunities for his neighbors.\r\n\r\nWith the profits of the loan, Calson will pay for his child's school fees, expand his business, and possibly create a store of cocoyams and plantains.  \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":299730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizer, seeds, and for transportation costs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Bailem, Belo, N.W.

Imelda is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which she will use to purchase new items to expand her product offerings. This will be Imelda's second loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from her business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

He currently grows citrus and guava, and has more than 32 years experience in getting harvests from the soil. One of the problems that has most often caused him loses and left him short of money is theft of his produce.

her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients (many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti). Her group is located in the areas surrounding San Pedro, and their community depends on tourists. It is a poor area where the economy used to thrive on sugar cane but has more recently waned, and where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. \r\n\r\nLuisa makes her home here in a simple structure with her husband and their three children. She is excited to be taking out her 4th loan with Esperanza, after having successfully repaid her previous loans and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to purchase calling cards, mobile phones, copy paper, etc. She operates a Cybercaf\u00e9, where she offers services such as photocopying, internet access, and printing.

She has two children.  One is 8 years old and the other is only one year old.  She requested this loan so that she could buy supplies for making snacks.  She has been in this business for several years.  She has a small sales location in the market where she sells different snacks such as 'sopes' (fried tortillas topped with refried beans and spicy sauce), fried tacos, enchiladas, tostadas and beef tacos.  She says that she started this business from necessity as her husband's money didn't reach far enough.  When her daughter started elementary school she was going to need more money and, for this reason, she started her business.  She tells us that it is doing well and she plans to use the loan that she requested to buy other products so that she can sell other types of snacks since her customers are asking her to make another type of stew and, as the saying goes, 'al cliente lo que pida' (\"give the customer what he wants\").\r\n\r\nYesenia would like to expand her business and she would like her children to study and have

He is married and he had 6 children. The oldest one is 26 and the others are 21, 13, 11, 8 and 1 year old respectively. The are all in school except for the youngest one. Besides his sons and daughters, he also supports his mother and nephews that live with her by sending money and food. \r\nSousa went to school until the 8th grade and because of his family situation he had to start working at an early age to cover the expenses, worse yet, there were no evening classes available at that time. Sousa worked for a pottery company in Mozambique that awarded him in 1981 with a 3-year scholarship in Cuba. He still receives pension payments from that company. He lives in his own home.\r\nIn 1989, Sousa built an iron shop that later had to be passed on to his ex-wife when they were divorced. Sousa is now self-employed. Since 1999 he has been running a restaurant he built with his own resources. The restaurant opens at 8:00am and closes at 9:00pm; it has 3 employees. He learned the skills needed on his own when he realized that his salary was not enough to pay for his family\u00b4s needs. The best selling dish is pork meat which goes for 80,00mt and costs him 45,00mt. His monthly income is 12000,00mt and from that amount he saves 3500,00mt.\r\nThis is his second loan request in his life and first through Kiva. The first loan was in the amount of 10000,00mt given by BPD (People\u00b4s Development Bank) and it was used to build the iron shop his ex-wife now owns. The second loan will be used to purchase a variety of products for the restaurant, thus, increasing sales. \r\nIn the future, with help from other loans, Sousa intends to open up a butcher\u00b4s shop to sell meat and expand his business.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p> \r\n\r\nSousa L. tem 46 ano de idade, casado maritalmente e pai de 6 filhos sendo de 26 anos de idade o primeiro, 21 o segundo, 13 o terceiro, 11 o quarto, 8 o quinto e um ano o sexto. Todos ainda estudam excepto o menor de todos. Para al\u00e9m dos seus filhos sustenta a sua mae e seus sobrinhos que vive com a sua mae enviando dinheiros ou generos alimenticios.\r\n\r\nSousa estudou at\u00e9 Oitava Classe e por situa\u00e7\u00e3o familiar teve que come\u00e7ar a trabalhar muito novo para sustentar a familia e como  na era nao tinhas escolas que davam aulas de noite. Sousa trabalhou na ceramica de Mo\u00e7ambique empresa que lhe deu bolsa para estudar em Cuba em 1981 por tres anos, empresa que at\u00e9 hoje se benificia de uma pensao. Vive numa casa pr\u00f3pria.\r\n\r\nEm 1989 Sousa construiu uma ferragem qual teve que deixar com  sua primeira esposa, quando se divorciaram.  Sousa trabalha a conta pr\u00f3pria, onde desde 1999 explora um estabelecimento (Restaurante) constru\u00eddo por fundos pr\u00f3prios o Restaurante abre as 8:00h e fecha as 21:00h e tem 3 empregados. Aprendeu o trabalho por inciativa pr\u00f3pria quando viu que o salario n\u00e3o respondia as necessidades da casa. O prato com mais sa\u00edda \u00e9 o acompanhado com carne de Porco que vende por 80,00mt meticais qual lhe custa 45,00mt.

He is 43 and widowed with three adult children. To make a living, Jose owns a business planting and harvesting rice for sale. Jose has been engaged in his business for over 20 years and earns approximately 40000 PHP during harvest season.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Jose joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. He is requesting a new loan of 25000 PHP to purchase fertilizer such as manure. This loan will be the 8th loan taken out by Jose from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 49 years old. Terisita is married and has 2 adult children. To make a living, Terisita owns and operates a sari-sari or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Terisita has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<P>\r\nIn 2008, Terisita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Terisita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Terisita is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by Terisita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. <P>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:<P>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Since the birth of her second daughter, her work at home has increased.  She also supports her mother-in-law who lives with her at home.  Yolanda manages to have time for farming along the way, and thanks to her attentiveness, she achieved an abundant harvest of potatoes and peas that are of high quality.  She decided to sell her crops directly at the largest market in the city of Lima.  Her earnings will be used to purchase a car that her husband can use as a passenger taxi.\r\n<p>\r\nYolanda has no intention to quit farming.  In fact, she plans to increase her production since she will no longer have difficulty transporting her products.  She can load sacks of produce into her car and transport them to the market in Tarma, which will make her work load feel lighter.  Yolanda is very happy with her harvest and the ability to move her produce.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Yolanda\u2019s first loan with MFP.  She is happy to be part of a communal bank.

She is 32 years old. Joveryann is the leader of a two-member loan group sponsored by GDMPC. Although each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for repayingthe loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJoveryann is widowed and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Joveryann owns and operates a retail store where she sells daily-use products, such as candies, biscuits, sugar, salt, shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. Joveryann has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Joveryann joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Joveryann has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from GDMPC. Joveryann is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Joveryann from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":492337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

Throughout the Kathmandu Valley, skilled artisans produce unique pieces of art that reflect Nepal's cultural diversity.  Terracotta pottery comes from the red clay of the surrounding Himalayan foothills.  Bronze and silver statuettes are formed using wax molds and intricate hand tool finishing.  In Patan, Newari culture and traditions are reflected in the images and symbols etched into metal or formed in stone.  With the help of a Kiva loan, Nepal's artisans are able to purchase raw materials in greater volume.  This increase in volume allows a single artisan to work on several pieces at the same time while increasing her profit margin.  \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.

Saloevich A. has been selling clothes on the market for 17 years. He is married and has 3 children. His wife is not employed and the clothes business is the primary source of income for the Asrarov family. At first he was purchasing clothes in credit from the wholesalers and selling them at the market. However, due to the competition on the market Mr. A. was forced to find an alternative lending source... In the beginning of 2005 he found out about the credit program \"Microintrest\". Mr. A. received a loan and with that money was able to purchase goods from wholesalers without credit, which resulted in lower prices. After receiving more loans he was able to import the goods himself, bypassing the wholesaler altogether. Currently Misharif A. regularly travels to Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan) himself to import the clothes he will sell at the market. He also sells clothes in credit to the small merchants from kishlaks (mountain villages) which is profitable for both parties. A part of the income he uses to support his family, but majority he has dedicated to expanding his business.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva
