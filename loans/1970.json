She resides in Kuwadzana 5, a high density suburb in Harare, Zimbabwe. <br \/><br \/>Her place of operation is strategically set since it is the center of a bigger suburb called Kuwadzana. Affectionately known as little \u201cMessina\u201d,  Kuwadzana is tremendously busy and is a cash cow area for most businesses. People from all walks of life, different races and different classes all mix and mingle at the location. <br \/><br \/>Ottilia identified that her business would perform better in such an area and was fortunate enough to be allocated a table there by the authorities. She restocked some clothes and shoes from the little savings she had and proceeded to start a business. She was however not satisfied with the state of her business. She successfully applied for a 1st loan of $250 in October 2014. With that amount she restocked baby sandals, plastic sandals, stockings, towels and some adult sandals. Her group members who are cross border also help her out by restocking school shoes and school satchels on her behalf from South Africa.<br \/><br \/>Her business grew magnificently to everyone\u2019s amusement and her table attracted many customers because it was well stocked and the products were just irresistible as they were so eye-catching. Her sales rose dramatically and this enabled her to repay their loan on a timely basis. She bought a wheel barrow and managed to do some repairs at her table from the profits from her first loan.<br \/><br \/>Currently Ottilia has applied for a loan of $500 and intends to start crossing the border to South Africa so as to restock clothes, shoes and sandals for the festive season. She also intends to start operating at another flea market that is located in the central business district of Harare.

She and her group members religiously attended trainings offered at Thrive and they have learned good ways of running their businesses through financial trainings. <br \/><br \/><br \/>Tsitsi realises that her business is still in the growth phase. For her to sustain her profits as well as to preserve her capital, she wishes to extend her fowl run and increase the number of chicken batches she keeps at a time.

This is Joshua. He is the Head teacher of Raise Up a Child Primary School, a mixed school in the urban area of Namungoona in Kampala with 200 students. Raise Up a Child School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Raise Up a Child School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Joshua ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne

With Babban Gona\u2019s support, Buhari can store his maize and sell it in the future for up to 37% higher than the market price at harvest. \nBuhari is grateful to be part of the Babban Gona family and in the end hopes to use his increased earnings to provide employment to members of his community through his farm."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2033375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-11-27T19:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-27T19:30:05Z","loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Buhari","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":24496.25,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":24496.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-04T00:45:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":983612,"name":"Khady's Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ce groupe cr\u00e9\u00e9 depuis juillet 2011,rassemble des membres qui habitent le m\u00eame village et ont comme activit\u00e9 le commerce et l'\u00e9levage.\n\nAwa qui se trouve \u00e0 l'extr\u00eame droite de la photo et levant le bras,est la responsable du groupe,est la repr\u00e9sentante du groupe,elle est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 50 ans,est veuve et m\u00e9re de 08 enfants dont 04 gar\u00e7ons.\n\nSon activit\u00e9 principale est l'\u00e9levage et comme activit\u00e9 secondaire elle pratique le commerce de c\u00e9r\u00e9ales.\n\nAvec le cr\u00e9dit,elle compte acheter 01 mouton \u00e0 25000f,02 sacs de mil \u00e0 7500f le sac,100kg d'arachide \u00e0 250f le kg.\n\nLe b\u00e9n\u00e9fice est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 la nourriture et aux frais de sant\u00e9 de ses enfants.","en":"This group was set up in July 2011, assembled from members who live in the same village and have as an activity business and livestock farming.

This is Alex. He is the Head teacher of Oxford High School, a mixed school in the rural area of Maluku in Mbale with 800 students. Oxford School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will save the school money in the long-term as the expense of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Oxford School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day. In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction and as fuel for fires. Also, methane from the dung can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2033277,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a young cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"Chappagaun","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2015-11-27T20:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-27T20:00:01Z","loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chandika","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2015-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.67},{"due_date":"2016-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":4166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.59},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.58},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-27T21:26:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caty McKenna","image":1831459}},{"id":983451,"name":"Colobane Magasin-Pc2 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le banc villageois dont fait partie ce groupe a \u00e9t\u00e9 inaugur\u00e9 en mai deux mille sept.C'est un groupe compos\u00e9 de femmes qui pratiquent le commerce.

Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2033457,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"Chappagaun","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2015-11-27T20:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-27T20:50:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bindu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2016-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-11-27T22:57:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":984534,"name":"Nada","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nada is a 44-year-old Lebanese married woman living with her husband and two working children.

She also sells watermelon, papaya, native apples, and other Filipino fruit staples. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,000 PHP in sales every day. <br \/><br \/>Petronila is requesting a 40,000 PHP loan to purchase more varieties of fruit to sell. She will use both her loan to improve her sales and her additional revenue to improve her family's general living conditions.<br \/><br \/>In the future, Petronila hopes to find new customers and increase sales.

By borrowing a supporting capital, she believes this could resolve her inadequacies in business. She hopes to improve her inventory by adding more grocery items like bottled water, sacks of rice, beverages, cooking oil and other common commodities. She is applying for a loan amount of Php 20,000 and praying that her request will be granted.

He has a land plot, which is about 12 hectares large. On this land Shavkat cultivates carrots, potatoes, and grain crops. His wife helps him with caring for and rearing the livestock. Since their land plot is large, they also pasture their livestock on it. \r\n\r\nThe animal husbandry business brings in good income, thus Shavkat wants to expand this business by increasing his livestock headcount. Thus he has applied to Arvand in order to receive a loan to buy livestock. Shavkat thanks Arvand in advance for the
