He is refugee. Cahid is living in the refugee settlement called Bilasuvar in the southern part of the country. He resides with his family, like his father and mother.\r\n\r\nCahid has a college education and uses this knowledge in his daily farming activities because he studied agricultural subjects.\r\n\r\nTo provide a good income for his family he is involved in agriculture. Cahid started his business 8 years ago and has good experience in it so far. He has 6 cows and 14 sheep. He raises calves, fattens them and then takes their meat to the local bazaar.

Thanks to her good high school education, she was able to pass them and became a freshman.\r\n \r\nWhile preparing for the exams, Aizada\u2019s father cheered her up by saying that his daughters shouldn\u2019t be a farmer like him, as he couldn\u2019t provide them a good life and the promise of a bright future. He used to say that making Aizada\u2019s life good or bad is in her hands. She can obtain success and a better life by herself, by getting a good education and trying her best in this life.\r\n\r\nAizada is all too thankful for her father\u2019s advice and now hopes to continue her studies at AUCA with the help of a Kiva loan. She says that her parents\u2019 income is just enough for her living, food and transportation expenses, but is not enough for the university fee."}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2034403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for her higher education","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Talas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":326,"posted_date":"2015-11-28T15:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-28T15:10:05Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#Low-profitFP"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aizada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":68,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-01T15:33:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katie B"}},{"id":984307,"name":"Leo Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Dans le but de stabiliser sa famille, surtout ses enfants scolaris\u00e9s, en constance mutation pour des raisons professionnelles de son \u00e9poux, Solange s'est lanc\u00e9e dans la vente des pagnes depuis 2008.

The business that she has right now is also known as \u201csari-sari\u201d store in the Philippines which means \u201cvariety of choices\u201d. Most Filipinos prefer to buy items here since there\u2019s no need for them to spend money for a fare just to buy a product. Most sari-sari stores are located in every barangay (village), municipality or even in cities. She has the business at the comfort of her own home in Taguig, Philippines.<br \/><br \/>Arlene is eager to earn each day to support the day-to-day needs of her family. Being in the business for 8 years now, she aims to succeed in her chosen industry by having complete products to offer to clients. She also dreams of buying her own motorized tricycle as another source of income. However, there are customers who pay late for the products, that\u2019s why supporting capital is what she wants to maintain so that she\u2019ll be able to buy grocery items and sacks of rice to add to the business.

She\u2019s been supporting her mother by efficiently managing the family retail business in the Bulambuli district in Eastern Uganda. While working in her mother\u2019s shop, Barbra was recommended by an agricultural officer as one of the youths who become part of a youth energy promotion campaign that was being championed by a non-government organization in the eastern part of the country. It was there that she emerged as one of the most entrepreneurial and best sales persons in the campaign. <br \/><br \/>With the wealth of experience gained during the campaign and with her keen interest in renewable energy products, she started selling UpEnergy products by stocking some of their cook stoves in her mother\u2019s shop. However the limited space in her mother\u2019s shop and the lack of proper transportation has been limiting her ability to reach most of her customers, especially the women\u2019s groups. It\u2019s through them that she sells most of the products and they are in great need of the cook stoves and water filters. She is proud to be able to improve the livelihoods of people in her community who are able to save from improved fuel use and improving on the health of most women through the reduction in indoor air pollution. Barbra plans to use part of the profits from her business to enroll in a business course in a nearby university. Her aspiration is to become a leading entrepreneur in the renewable energy sector and a successful businesswoman in her community. <br \/><br \/>The loan will make it possible for Barbra to scale up her business and allow her to increase her stock, so that she saves time and transportation costs by not having to travel as often to replenish her stock in order to meet the high demand for stoves in her region.  A portion of the loan will go into leasing warehousing space and hiring a pick-up van that will make it easy for her to reach rural communities. It will reduce the transportation costs that currently significantly reduce her take-home earnings."}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":3950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2034637,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Renewable Energy Products","sector":"Retail","themes":["Innovative Loans","Green"],"use":"to pay for cookstoves, warehousing space and transportation of products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Bulambuli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":290,"posted_date":"2015-11-28T20:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-28T20:50:12Z","loan_amount":3950,"lender_count":116,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#JobCreator"},{"name":"#SupportingFamily"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Barbra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":13220000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":3950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":5570000},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450000},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1664.26},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.46},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.46},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.46},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.46},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.46},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.46},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.46},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.46},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.46},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.45},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.45},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.45},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.45},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.45},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.45},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.45},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-02T08:43:53Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey","image":713929}},{"id":984619,"name":"Djatougbe","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Veuve et m\u00e8re de de trois enfants, Djatougb\u00e9 est une femme \u00e2g\u00e9e de 56 ans r\u00e9sidant \u00e0 Baguida.

Kiganda School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Kiganda School will repay this loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

With three children who were still in school, this was a huge wake-up call for her. Terefina had to venture into cross-border trading and would travel to foreign lands such as South Africa and Botswana, where she had never thought she would go. She would buy different clothes and shoes. Because she was inexperienced, she incurred high import costs, as the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority would charge exorbitant import duty fees. This made it more difficult for her to sell to her clients, since the clothing would now be more expensive and it would take more than two months to get full repayment. <br \/><br \/>She was lost in the dark, but as a mother, she had to provide for her children. That is when it dawned on her that a friend of hers who was also widowed seemed to make ends meet by selling fish. She went to her friend for help, and in no time they were travelling together to a nearby lake called Lake Chivero to buy fish. They would leave their houses as early as 4:00 a.m. so that they could buy straight from the fishermen and cut out the middleman to reduce cost. They would then walk door to door selling the fish in their neighbourhood.<br \/><br \/>The fish business has proven worthwhile for Terefina, as she has been able to pay rentals and school fees for her children. She even managed to celebrate all her children\u2019s birthdays this year and has been saving small amounts for Christmas gifts for them. Since their father died, this will be the first year that they will have been able to celebrate birthdays and Christmas.<br \/><br \/>Terefina is now 36 years old and has joined hands with fellow neighbours in Kuwadzana 5, a high-density suburb in Harare, to form a group called \u2018Speed\u2019. They have completed training on financial literacy and group dynamics, and they are now applying for a loan of $900 to boost their businesses. <br \/><br \/>Terefina needs $300 to enable her to buy the fish in bulk, since her customer base has increased and she is frequently running out of stock these days."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2034774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy fish in bulk, since her customer base has increased and she is frequently running out of stock these days.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ZW","country":"Zimbabwe","town":"Harare","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-19 29","type":"point"}},"partner_id":367,"posted_date":"2015-11-28T21:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-28T21:20:08Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Widowed"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Terefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angeline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lydia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-05T05:01:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Haiss","image":1251749}},{"id":985278,"name":"Kigaga Bakyara Kweyombeka Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The group was mobilized, trained and they have requested their first loan from UGAFODE Microfinace.

Therefore Laura leads the bank. Her business is selling artisan products made of palm. Palm is a tree from which all sizes of hats are made, placemats for dining tables, wallets, baskets, dolls, costume jewelry, hairbands, keychains, and other items.  \u201c90% of the families here weave palm, and we even make, upon request, dresses from palm, \u201c she shares. <br \/><br \/>Her business is successful because it is the only place that sells and makes these artisan products. The advantage for her business is that she can count on seasons of strong sales. The challenge is the lack of working capital. Her dream is to open a large store to sell the products inside the market. She wishes to buy materials to work with such as palms, glue, thread, and other items.  This is the first sequence of loans with the institution in the 10 years that she has had this business.<br \/><br \/>It is for these reasons that Laura seeks a loan to buy materials to make artisan products from palm.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nNashibiso School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

Benison ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2034820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Bundibugyo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-11-28T21:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-28T21:50:07Z","loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Super School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":3581300,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":33,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":447662},{"due_date":"2018-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":447666}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.38},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.37},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-04T01:36:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey","image":713929}},{"id":985454,"name":"Vilma Yanira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Vilma, de 46 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada, su esposo trabaja en la agricultura y tienen 5 hijos. \n\nVilma, decidi\u00f3 iniciar su propio negocio desde hace 2 a\u00f1os, todo inicio gracias a una amiga que le ense\u00f1o a trabajar en la venta de mariscos y con un poco de dinero prestado por un familiar inicio su venta; el negocio ha funcionado muy bien y est\u00e1 vez necesita dinero para invertir m\u00e1s.\n\nVilma, necesita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar maricos para vender en las comunidades m\u00e1s cercanas. \n\nSu sue\u00f1o es comprar un veh\u00edculo para vender mariscos en otros municipios y mejorar sus ingresos.

It will help her obtain more grocery items, dry goods, and beverages. With an enhanced inventory, she can increase her profit and cover their daily expenditures. She is praying that you will be one of God\u2019s instruments to help her. She would really appreciate your kind support.   <br \/><br \/>Myla is committed to CCT Credit Cooperative\u2019s vision to alleviate poverty, and she regularly meets with her co-fellowship members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Bright Children School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

She is married and has two sons who are 13 and 15 years old, and a daughter who is 3. She runs a business selling food. Emma is patient, a good listener, and very loyal. Her business is located in the \"vichaya\" province, a rural area which is known as the stucco production zone. For the most part, the residents of this area work in stucco and lime mines. The climate is cool, with a maximum temperature of 12 degrees Centigrade.\r\nEmma has a dark complexion and long black hair which she braids. She wears traditional clothing (a hat, poncho and skirt). Her native language is Aymar\u00e1, which she speaks at home, and she speaks Spanish in day-to-day life. She shares her life with her husband, who works in a quarry, and with their children, who are in school. They live in a room made of adobe and brick with a corrugated iron roof and an earthen floor which has electricity but doesn't have water or plumbing because they don't have those utilities in their area.\r\nEmma sells traditional food such as \"p'esque\" which is quinoa cooked in water and served with milk, cheese or meat and which is the favorite food of the people, musicians, writers and even bricklayers. \r\n\"When I was young it was very typical for me to spend my afternoons with my grandmother, accompanying her and helping her in the kitchen. She was the cook of the family and she passed on her passion for the kitchen. She gave me her tips and some of her recipes\" says Emma. Her business is successful because the people of her community eat her food daily. The advantage of her business is that the ingredients come from nearby; the disadvantage is the lack of an oven to cook in. \r\nEmma's dream is to live in the city and she hopes to build an oven to cook in.
