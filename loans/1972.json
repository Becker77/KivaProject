She has a huge debt from her neighbors in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. Many of her debtors pay after several weeks and she cannot force them because she knows that there are times when money is really difficult to earn. It\u2019s a good thing that she has an alternative source of income, which is direct selling of cosmetics and personal care products from a known brand, Avon. She offers it to office workers with regular salaries. <br \/><br \/>Her husband, Rodrigo, is a driver and his income somehow sustains their everyday needs. But it\u2019s not enough to support the educational expenses of their two children in college and high school. This is the reason why Anelina aims to improve her variety store so it can augment the growing family's expenses. A loan of 50,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) would be very helpful for her to buy additional stocks of dry goods, grocery items, and beverages for her store. Part of it will be used to pay for higher quantity of cosmetics and personal care products which she can sell to regular wage earners.

She has different brochures of known brands like Ever Bilena and Avon. She shows these brochures to her customers where they can choose from different lines of products. There are cosmetics, toiletries, intimate apparel, and household needs. Usually dealers have 25% discount (or higher) from the brochure price which serves as their profit. They also earn from rebates, recruitment rewards, etc.<br \/><br \/>Merlita meticulously studies the specifications of every product in her brochures so she can easily answer the queries of her customers. Because of this positive attitude, she has gained their trust and confidence. Now she is expanding her network of target customers.<br \/><br \/>She is expecting a higher demand for her products as the peak season of Christmas approaches. Therefore, she has applied for additional capital worth PHP 40,000 to meet this. Her continuous income adds to her husband Antonio\u2019s salary and supports their usual needs and college expenses of their two children.<br \/><br \/>She desires for good health, a brighter future for her children and harmonious family relationship where God is the center. She meets with her co-fellowship* members every week to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. *All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

","en":"This is Mohira.  She is a 21-year-old seamstress who lives in the Muminobod region.  She lives with her father, mother, sister, brother, sister-in-law, and grandchildren.  Mohira is a ladylike and independent young woman.  She works as a school teacher, but after school she works from home making custom women's clothing.

","en":"Tursunjon is a decent, hard working, and fast moving woman.  She was born into a farmer's family in 1952.  Her parents died when she was still a young girl.  She was raised by her elder brothers and an uncle.  Tursunjon married after finishing school and for a time felt that she was the happiest of women, but it wasn't for long.  Her husband left her and their daughter to work in Russia and he never returned.  After he left, Tursunjon started raising cattle in order to feed her family, since it was she alone who bore the responsibility. With time, Tursunjon gained experience in animal husbandry.  Tursunjon waited five years for her husband in the hope that he would come back one fine day.   But he never did, and there were even rumors that he remarried in Russia.   Because of this, her mother- and father-in-law allowed her to remarry so that she could find happiness for the years she had left.  Thanks to her patience, after several years Tursunjon again became the happiest of women.\r\n\r\nTursunjon is still in business, fattening and selling cattle.  She earns such good money that she can save half and spend the other half taking care of her family.  This year, she used her savings to start repairing her home, but she doesn't have enough to finish the work and buy vinyl windows and doors.  Having heard about MDO Arvand, LLC's green loan program, Tursunjon applied for a loan.  She will use the loan to buy and install modern, vinyl windows and doors."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2031796,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy and install vinyl windows and doors","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-11-29T14:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-29T14:10:04Z","loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tursunjon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":247.67},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":262.4},{"due_date":"2016-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":263.76},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":270.57},{"due_date":"2016-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":281.66},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":286.65},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":290.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":302.42},{"due_date":"2016-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":307.57},{"due_date":"2016-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":315.51},{"due_date":"2016-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":324.22},{"due_date":"2016-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":346.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.15},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.36},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.56},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.59},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.25},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.6},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.36},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.14},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.33},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.63},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-07T18:24:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":985855,"name":"Khaerea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khaerea is an amazing mother who lives in a small village near Tulkarem.

is a 37-year-old married male living in Kosovo with his wife, one daughter and his parents. For the last 9 years he has worked as a hairdresser for others so that he could gain experience. This year, he is planning to start his own business as a hairdresser. In order to start his business, he was able to obtain most of the money from his parents, and the remaining part will be from the loan. Bashkim requested the loan to pay for the start-up inventory, such as the chairs, tables and doors.

She was born in 1980 and grew up in a working class family. She married after completing high school, and is now the mother of two children. Her husband is a plumber, but he doesn't make enough to support the family and pay for the children's education. Because of this Zohida and her husband decided to raised livestock to earn additional income. Twice a month her husband buys animals at the livestock market, and Zohida and the children feed them. After two or three months the animals are resold. Some of the money earned goes to purchasing animal feed, and some is spent on the family. Zohida spends much of her free time caring for the animals, and the children help her as well. Zohida and her husband together decided to increase the number of animals they raise. To do this they will need additional capital, so they decided to request a loan from Arvand. The loan will be used to expand their business. The additional income earned will be used to provide for the family and pay for the children's education."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2033132,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2015-11-29T15:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-29T15:40:04Z","loan_amount":900,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zohida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":909.62},{"due_date":"2016-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":948.35},{"due_date":"2016-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":966.99},{"due_date":"2016-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1018.88},{"due_date":"2016-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1050.75},{"due_date":"2016-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1105.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.45},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":142.25},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.05},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.83},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.61},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":985209,"name":"Nagina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nagina is 41 years old and a married woman.

Denis ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2035705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Sheema","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-11-29T16:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-29T16:40:07Z","loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bukuba Grammar School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1121000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":224200},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":224200},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224200},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":224200},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":224200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-01T16:44:18Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tracey","image":713929}},{"id":986107,"name":"Ana Leticia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana de 36 a\u00f1os de edad, no estudi\u00f3 pero aprendi\u00f3 a escribir con ayuda de unas personas de la comunidad, es viuda y procre\u00f3 cuatro hijos de los cuales uno falleci\u00f3 hace dos a\u00f1os y los otros tres viven con ella.\n\nAna se dedica a comprar y vender granos b\u00e1sicos, labor que lleva haciendo desde hace 10 a\u00f1os, el trabajo lo aprendi\u00f3 de su esposo quien se dedicaba a este oficio, adem\u00e1s ella siempre se ha dedicado a los oficios del hogar, de modo que es una mujer luchadora que se esfuerza por sacar adelante a sus hijos sola.\n\nElla solicita este cr\u00e9dito para comprar ma\u00edz, frijol, arroz, etc. y continuar con su negocio de venta de granos b\u00e1sicos, ya que comprar al por mayor para que sea mas barato y sacarle m\u00e1s ganancias a la hora de venderlo.\n\nSus sue\u00f1os son mejorar el negocio de venta de granos b\u00e1sicos y apoyar a sus hijos en los estudios.\n","en":"36-year old Ana did not attend school but she learned to write with help from people in the community.

She works hard each day and she is confident that she is closer to reaching her goals.<br \/><br \/>Ester believes that business is her stepping stone to making her dreams come true. She knows how important it is for her neighbors and daily customers to have a nearby store where they can buy a sachet of shampoo, a bar of soap, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, an egg, toothpaste, or even an ice tube. Because she buys her products from a wholesaler at a lower price than she sells them, Ester makes some profit.<br \/><br \/>She wants to manage a bigger store someday, so she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan that she will use to buy additional groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory.

Meaning, they are paid after every day of work, 200 PHP or 300 PHP per day for example. They budget this amount for daily food, transportation, and other usual expenses. Therefore they cannot afford to buy big volume of supplies for long time household use such as sacks of rice, big bottles of cooking oil, several kilos of sugar, and so on. This is the reason why retail stores are very common in different communities. Customers buy repacked cooking oil good for one-time cooking or one sachet of shampoo good for two showers. \r\n\r\nJust like other store owners, Rosita suffers from long term debt of some of her neighbors, which affects the stability of her business. This is why she applied for a 15,000 PHP loan to buy stock of groceries, rice, charcoal, and soft drinks. In due time, she aspires to widen her inventory so she can attract more customers.  \r\n\r\nShe prays for a college diploma for all her children and good living conditions for her whole family someday. She shares her experiences and aspirations with her co-fellowship* members at CCT Credit Cooperative. They regularly meet every week to share stories about their life and businesses and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and the Word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.
