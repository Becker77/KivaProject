With this, Sarlyn applied for a Php 50,000 loan and prays that CCT would approve the amount.<br \/><br \/>On a weekly basis, Sarlyn regularly meets with her co-fellowship members to share her life\u2019s testimony, experience on the business and to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and listen to the Word of God.

Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Bundibugyo Junior School will repay its loan from its school fees, which are collected each term.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. <br \/><br \/>Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the longterm as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase two UV water treatment systems with a 450 litre tank and a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Nyahuka School will repay its loan from its school fees, which are collected each term. Godfrey ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students' concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from waterborne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2035816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Bundibugyo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-11-29T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-29T19:50:03Z","loan_amount":2225,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nyahuka Parents School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":7398600,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":33,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":924824},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":924824},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":924824},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":924824},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":924824},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":924824},{"due_date":"2018-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":924824},{"due_date":"2018-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":924832}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.13},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.13},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":278.13},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.12},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.12},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":278.12},{"due_date":"2018-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.12},{"due_date":"2018-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-01T18:22:30Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauri Fried-Lee","image":null}},{"id":986175,"name":"D\u00fao Jerem\u00edas 2 Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"DUO JEREMIAS 2\nMarina de 36 a\u00f1os es madre soltera,  de dos ni\u00f1os menores de edad los cuales asisten a la escuela, ella se dedica a la venta de productos de cer\u00e1mica y productos pl\u00e1sticos desde hace 8 a\u00f1os.

She currently has a business making and selling blankets. She states that she learnt this business from a family member and decided to start her own business a number of years ago.<br \/><br \/>The current loan will be used to increase her capital (to purchase yarn wholesale). She will buy it from the wholesalers in the city of El Alto and then use it to manufacture and later sell the products at her store. This type of work allows her to generate income to support her family financially, as she is married and has 2 children. <br \/><br \/>When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes the healthcare and training that the organisation offers."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":4650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2036088,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase yarn wholesale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2015-11-29T21:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-29T21:50:01Z","loan_amount":4650,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Fabrics"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erika Felicidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Diego Ramiro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam Felipa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Giovana Marizabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":32076,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4776},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5045.26},{"due_date":"2016-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":5327},{"due_date":"2016-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":5406.84},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":5554.68},{"due_date":"2016-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":5966.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":692.37},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":731.4},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":772.25},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":783.82},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":805.25},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":864.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-03T00:23:39Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jemma Ives","image":1373786}},{"id":986491,"name":"Emilly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emilly is a married woman.
