The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nBundibugyo Teachers College will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

She has owned and operated an agriculture business selling beans and Irish potatoes for the past 5 years, an enterprise that requires her to work from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m. every day, and still manage her household.\r\n\r\nJeanne d`Arc has requested a Koramuhinzi loan from Kiva lenders via Vision Finance Company to expand her agriculture business by cultivating more beans and Irish potatoes to sell. The Koramuhinzi loan product is a pre-harvest loan where the borrower will not be required to pay off the principle until after the harvest. This loan will allow Jeanne d`Arc and her family to maintain their current standard of living until proceeds from the harvest arrive. With the pre-harvest funds, Jeanne d`Arc will be able to pay her children's school fees and provide family support until her crops are ready to sell.

Elsa is married, with a fifth grade education, and has grown children who no longer live at home. She lives in the town of Guardian\u00eda del Hato, Sacatep\u00e9quez, Guatemala. Her main business is making and selling tortillas.   \nElsa is starting her fourth loan cycle with Namaste.  When she started with Namaste she had a monthly net profit of 5734 Guatemalan Quetzales making tortillas on a wood stove and selling them out of her home. Now, 27 months later, she has completed the three cycles of the Namaste Basic Business Development Program and has had many hours of instruction in how to manage a business.  She has also worked for all these months with a Business Advisor who has given her advice on what she can do to grow her business. With each cycle she received a slightly larger loan, which she invested in her business with the guidance of her business advisor.  Her monthly net profit at the end of these three nine-month cycles had increased to 11726 Guatemalan Quetzales.\nThrough the training and business advice that she has received she has grown her business to the point where she now has four employees, several gas stoves and sells her tortillas in two different locations, one on the main street of her town.  She buys her corn in bulk and what she doesn\u2019t use she sells in small quantities to other women who make tortillas. She now sells fruits, vegetables and eggs, items that her customers have requested from her.  And on the weekends, she makes tamales.  She has also started saving for her old age.  She is concerned about the time when she may no longer be able to work.\nThe fourth cycle that Elsa is now entering is a Namaste pilot program for women who have the potential to grow their businesses beyond what they accomplished through the three cycles of the Basic Business Development Program, to the point of creating jobs for others in their communities.  She will receive even more education and advice and an even larger loan. She wants to expand all aspects of her business, buy her own vehicle so that she can more easily and less expensively transport both raw materials and her final products, and continue saving for the future.  She hopes to increase her monthly net profits to 20717 Guatemalan Quetzales during this cycle."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2039100,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy her own vehicle so that she can more easily and less expensively transport both raw materials and her final products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"La Guardian\u00eda, Sacatepequez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":"2015-11-30T17:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-30T17:10:04Z","loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Elderly"},{"name":"#RepeatBorrower"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":7500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2016-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":833.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.11},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-07T22:30:40Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":986311,"name":"Priscien","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Priscien a 35 ans, il est mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re d\u2019un enfant qui est scolaris\u00e9.

This is Godfrey. He is an Administrator of Parental Care School, a mixed school in the Rural area of Nyahuka in Bundibugyo with 500 students. Parental Care School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children.

Ruqayyah Islamic School will repay the loan from the school fees, which it collects each term. <br \/><br \/>Abubakar ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his students' concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2037907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"To purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Iganga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.609167 33.468611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-11-30T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-30T22:50:03Z","loan_amount":1400,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruqayyah Islamic School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":4672800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":934560},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":934560},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":934560},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":934560},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":934560}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":280},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":280}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-04T02:02:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maureen Wharton","image":null}},{"id":986867,"name":"Campo Ernesto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Campo es de estado civil soltero, tiene 65 a\u00f1os de edad, el se dedica a la producci\u00f3n y venta de leche, el ya lleva en esta dura actividad m\u00e1s de 30 a\u00f1os, el solicita del cr\u00e9dito para comprar una vaca de leche para aumentar la producci\u00f3n, y as\u00ed mejorar su calidad de vida y satisfacer sus necesidades diarias.

A colleague suggested that she sign up for sales by catalog. She accepted the proposal and began to generate sales of beauty products.
