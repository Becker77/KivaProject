They have four sons and they need a lot of care. Bilal is working for a low income and he cannot cover all of his family's needs, especially after the Syrian crises, since Jordanian and Syrian refugees are competing in the labor market. Because Syrians are accepting lower salaries, many business owners are not hiring as many Jordanians as before. Monthly salaries now range between 120-150 dinars.<br \/><br \/>That's why Ola decided to help Bilal by starting her small business. She opened a grocery which sells food supplies and ready clothes.

Fayzeh did not stop trying to help her husband with their life expenses generally, especially after he fell ill. She opened a grocery beside her home to help her husband to pay for his treatment and to help him with the expenses. Her small business was covering her family's needs with support from her husband's work as a salesman in bakery. <br \/><br \/>Fayzeh started her business five years ago and now she needs to develop and expand it. Therefore she applied for a loan to expand her grocery and buy more products such as canned foods, chips, candies, soft drinks, food supplies, juices, etc. Fayzeh is a mother who is ambitious and patient and she deserves that support from you to become an example for the other women."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2038092,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to expand her grocery and buy more products such as canned foods, chips, candies, soft drinks, food supplies, juices, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"JO","country":"Jordan","town":"Ramtha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31 36","type":"point"}},"partner_id":185,"posted_date":"2015-12-01T04:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-31T04:00:05Z","loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fayza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"JOD","disbursal_amount":1022,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":23,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2016-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2016-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2016-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2016-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2016-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2016-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2016-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2016-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2016-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2017-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2017-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2017-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2017-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2017-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2017-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2017-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":50.5},{"due_date":"2017-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":50.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.67},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.65},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.64},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":987399,"name":"Wadha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wadha is a 38-year-old single woman living in Hebron, Palestine.

But her life in Bishkek caused additional expenses for his parents like for transportation, renting flat, mobile phone expenses, etc. Having discussed with parents their financial situation, Zhyldyz decided to apply for a Kiva loan as it is provided by AUCA. <br \/><br \/>Kiva lenders support AUCA students during the last 3 years and give students a chance to get loan now and pay it back after graduation without interest fee. The last point is the necessary part for the students as they are sure that they will repay the same sum what they have taken, and will do it with pleasure after finding a good job."}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2036571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for her higher education at AUCA, where she studies Business Administration","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Osh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":326,"posted_date":"2015-12-01T15:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2015-12-31T15:10:05Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zhyldyz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":68,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-01T21:08:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":986609,"name":"Napho Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wan is excited the filter was available on an affordable, payment plan.

She realized that bricks manufactured by big companies were expensive and beyond the reach of the low income earners in and around her neighborhood. <br \/><br \/>She bought brick molding tools, shovels, and other necessary equipment for the brick manufacturing process. She started producing not only bricks but also precast walling slabs and pillars. Then she identified an experienced young man whom she employed to manufacture the bricks, and she pays him on commission according to the bricks he produces. <br \/><br \/>Synodia is not just an overseer but also helps to offload the sand being delivered by trucks to her yard.

Rutendo is a vernacular name which means faith and being hopeful in any situation.  <br \/><br \/>Pedzisai, far left in the photo, was based in South Africa, where she sold clothes for a living. Due to homesickness, she decided to come back to Zimbabwe where she would stay close to her family and care for her children. Pedzisai is a mother of five: four boys and a girl. <br \/><br \/>Pedzisai is now in the cross-border business of buying and selling java and wax cloths; she buys them from Zambia. On average, she sells 60 wax cloths per month, as well as other clothing like trousers and socks, in and around the community. Through this business, she is now able to buy more furniture for her house and pay her children\u2019s school fees.<br \/><br \/>Lack of adequate capital was hindering her ability to grow her business to its full potential.
