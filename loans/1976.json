She had just completed that sad chapter in her life of getting divorced when she was laid off at the local bank she was working for. <br \/>By chance, she listened to a radio program that asked questions relating to what they have been presenting with $50 worth of airtime vouchers as the prize. To her surprise, she got all the answers right and walked away with the capital that she used to start her business in 2010. <br \/><br \/>Priscilla is a 38 year old single, divorced parent and has 1 child. She is a member of a group called Siyabonga (translated from vernacular means THANK YOU). The group consists of 5 members who all reside in the same community in Harare.<br \/><br \/>Priscilla sold the $50 worth of airtime and retained the capital in the business, she quickly identified that airtime business was worth venturing into and she sourced some additional capital from relatives to restock in bulk. She operated her business earnestly and her profits gradually increased and she took account of every single cent in her business. Priscilla was able to open another airtime selling point within a period of a year that is in 2011 and she employed someone.<br \/> <br \/>She operated the 2 airtime selling points for 2 years and in 2013 she applied to become an Eco-cash agent. She had managed to raise the minimum capital requirements of $500 and she was successful in her application. Due to its convenient nature people flocked at her operating space to seek the various services offered by Eco-cash. <br \/><br \/>Down the line in 2014 she applied for to become a Telecash agent, another money transfer service. With 2 sites fully functioning both selling airtime and mobile money transfer services, profits increased dramatically. She indicated that she enjoys her trade since it allows her to mix with a lot of people and that makes her happy all the time.<br \/> <br \/>Priscilla requires a loan of $500, with the loan she intends to insert it into the 3 businesses floats.

opportunity for small scale chicken farmers in Zimbabwe. Many individuals started or extended their poultry businesses. This led to an increase in the need for poultry feed. The broiler chickens need a specialised diet in the six weeks of growth. Whilst many were building fowl runs and buying feeders for their day old chicks, Temptations decided to be the neighbourhood \u201cfeed warehouse\u201d where different types of chicken feed plus the required medicines are found. <br \/><br \/>She started buying chicken feed for resale around her neighbourhood in Budiriro in Harare. This was a welcome innovation by many chicken farmers as it brought chicken feed right to their doorsteps. Temptations recently joined Progress group, a group which is one of Thrive\u2019s oldest and most loyal clients. The group now consists of 5 members. For Temptation this is a first loan which she wants to use well under the guidance of the older, mature members in her group. She also attended training sessions and got business advice that she feels will help her in growing her business. <br \/><br \/>Every week, twenty seven year old Temptation hires a pickup truck to go and restock chicken feed. These weekly transport costs reduce her profit margins hence the need to restock once or twice a month in bulk thereby saving on transport costs.

The amount was used to buy additional products for the business.\r\n\r\nThe profit she\u2019s earning is just enough for their day-to-day expenditures. She aims to have an array of products to offer to clients and obtain more patrons that will result in increased sales. She decided to apply for another loan of Php 10, 000 since she wants to have products on stock such as bottled drinks and grocery items to add to her variety store business.\r\n\r\nOn a weekly basis, Sharon regularly meets with her co-fellowship members to share her life\u2019s testimony and experience of the business, to draw strength and inspiration from the fellowship and listen to the Word of God.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

They produce containers, drums, barbecues, barrels and food steamers, among other aluminium products. Her husband started this business because his parents showed him the technique and experience to work independently. At the beginning they did not count on enough tools or a workshop in good condition, but gradually they could overcome this difficulties. Nowadays, they have been able to enlarge the workshop, buy tools and also employ five more people.<br \/><br \/>The couple accomplishes good team work since while Rafael, her husband, makes the products, Laura goes to sell in nearby communities or delivers the goods already ordered. \"There are days when sales are very good and days when they are not, but it is our business and we like to do it\" she happily comments. <br \/><br \/>This is the first time that they are requesting VFMexico's support, which they expect to use to buy, mainly, aluminium sheets, since they represent the major expense, in addition to rivets and paint. Her goal is now to increase the product production to generate more income. <br \/><br \/>The other members of the group are Rosa, J.

Carolina wants to continuously support her family, which is why she\u2019s hardworking and determined to make the business grow. Her goal is to have her children finish college and to maintain good health for her family. \r\n\r\nCarolina is involved in a pig farming business, selling poultry supplies, and selling ready-to-wear clothes. She's thankful to God for being blessed of having  those businesses. To have complete poultry supplies and a variety of clothes to sell is what she wants to maintain.  An approximate amount of Php 20, 000 is what she needs, which is why she applied for the loan. She's hoping that CCT would once again grant her loan request.\r\n\r\nCarolina is consistent in attending a weekly fellowship group for CCT partners that consists of 15 to 30 members.

","en":"Meet Firuza, a 29-year-old native of the city of Tursunzoda and the mother of two daughters.  Her husband works as a handyman and renovates houses abroad.  Firuza herself has her own small farming business at home.  She is very serious about her work and spends a lot of time on her land.  She is also a caring and hardworking mother.  She doesn't wait for the money that her husbands sends home, but works at her own business in order to feed and clothe her children.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Firuza would like to prepare her soil for the coming planting season and treat it with mineral fertilizers.  She needs a certain amount of mineral fertilizers and she is taking a loan to make this purchase.
