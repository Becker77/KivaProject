With the opportunity to earn up to $2,000 per hectare of land, Rhoda hopes to realize better yields and plans on using her additional income to ensure that all her children get a post-secondary education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1970222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-12-03T15:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-02T15:20:06Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rhoda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":15317.33,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":15317.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-03T18:27:31Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JenniferN"}},{"id":988465,"name":"Norbibi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norbibi very kind and bright woman.

With the opportunity to earn up to $2000 per Hectare of land, Nuhu hopes to realize better yields and plans on using his additional income to ensure that all his children get a post secondary education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2039996,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-12-03T15:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-02T15:40:07Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nuhu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":14514.88,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":14514.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-03T17:08:50Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":987224,"name":"Gilberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gilberto, de 35 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta sexto grado, vive con su esposa y sus 4 hijos, mientras su esposa se dedica a los oficios dom\u00e9sticos.\n\nGilberto, trabaja en la pesca artesanal desde hace 10 a\u00f1os y adem\u00e1s de eso trabaja remendando redes desde muy joven y sale al mar todos los d\u00edas dependiendo de la marea y se embarca en la tarde para pescar por la noche o por la madrugada.\n\nGilberto, necesita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar un equipo de pesca, porque tiene uno pero ya es muy viejo y el rendimiento es menos. \n\nGilberto, sue\u00f1a con tener un equipo m\u00e1s para poder tener mejores ingresos y adem\u00e1s de eso desea ver crecer a todos sus hijos.  \n","en":"Gilberto is 35 and studied through the sixth grade.

His wife died and now lives with his elderly mother in a traditional hut that is not well ventilated, nor warms up well in winter. He lives with 4 of his children and 2 of his grandchildren. Neither of his children work proper jobs hence earn very little.He works long hours in his farm with 1 of his children while the other 2 are employed in other people's farms with the youngest of 14 still going to school during the week and helping in the field on Saturdays and Sundays. \n\nTogether with his youngest child, Mosiuoa had to wake up very early between 4am and 5am during the week, to start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water and warming the house for his family before going out to attend to daily work because he could not afford any other means. However with little money he makes while working,plus his mother's pension money,which is not much, and the little his other children make;he is now able to afford to buy gas and paraffin both which are very expensive.\n\nHe finds himself having to pay about R500 to R600 a month to have sufficient gas,paraffin and groceries which include candles for lighting and charcoal for his traditional home made heater;money he hardly makes. Not only is gas expensive for Mosiuoa and many like him, but it is highly flammable and when inhaled can lead to lung diseases even death. Candles have proven to cause a lot of fire accidents even deaths because they are often forgotten to blown out which is dangerous and the traditional heater is worse in Mosiuoa's family of small children like Mosiuoa's grandchildren. \n\nMosiuoa has requested a loan from Kiva lenders, in order to be able to purchase clean cook stoves which provide Mosiuoa and 7 other people from his village, who are living in the similar circumstances, the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families, and that does not require a lot of wood, which is hard to find in Lesotho, nor expensive paraffin and gas. This stove can be started with the use of very little, readily available biomass like dry twigs and dry cow dung that do not require lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the homes. \n\nThis stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery which runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones and a mini LED lamp. A life improving package for these people. This stove saves them time to be with their family, saves energy, eliminates the element of toxic inhalation, house burning and has given them the freedom to have a better lit home to see better in the evening while cooking and enables children to do their homework.

Benefiting from Babban Gona\u2019s marketing support, Bashiru has the opportunity to generate earnings of up to $2,000 per hectare of land. <br \/><br \/>Bashiru is thankful that he no longer has to worry about lacking money to repair his house or move into a bigger home and looks forward to using his additional earnings to ensure that all his children get a post-secondary education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2040129,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-12-03T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-02T18:50:03Z","loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Vegan"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bashiru","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":32859.97,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":32859.97}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-09T15:06:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":987295,"name":"Rebeca Veronica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rebeca de 34 a\u00f1os de edad, vive al lado de su compa\u00f1ero de vida, su hija de 1 a\u00f1o y su hijo de 7 a\u00f1os de edad.

Hauwa is thankful that she now has the opportunity to improve the life of her children and family and looks forward to using her additional earnings to diversify her farm and grow other crops."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2025299,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-12-03T22:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-02T22:20:06Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hauwa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":15371.54,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":15371.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-04T05:53:24Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":988664,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Victoria is married and is the mother of 4 children, all of whom are going to school  She is the owner of her house  She makes cheese, which she learned with her mother when she was little She needs a loan to buy a cow because she wants to increase her cheese production and needs more milk.<br \/><br \/> She will appreciate your help as she works hard and she is healthy"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2040124,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cheese Making","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a cow for more milk for cheese making","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":48,"posted_date":"2015-12-03T22:30:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-02T22:30:01Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":543.03},{"due_date":"2016-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":549.76},{"due_date":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":561.31},{"due_date":"2016-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":563.54},{"due_date":"2016-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":572.44},{"due_date":"2016-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":577.63},{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":586.24},{"due_date":"2016-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":592.06},{"due_date":"2016-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":599.4},{"due_date":"2016-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":607.57},{"due_date":"2016-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":614.37},{"due_date":"2016-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":632.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.52},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.5},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.19},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.52},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.82},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.58},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.84},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.69},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.77},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.97},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.96},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-09T21:33:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":988280,"name":"Maricel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Two years ago, 32-year-old Maricel successfully started her own business.

With the opportunity to earn up to $2000 per hectare of land, Hamisu hopes to realize better yields and plans on using his additional income to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2040432,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-12-04T00:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-03T00:00:04Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hamisu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":19566.86,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":19566.86}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-06T02:06:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sandi Chamberlain","image":202541}},{"id":988708,"name":"Musa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Musa is maize farmer from Nabai village.

Samaila is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2040467,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-12-04T00:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-03T00:20:04Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samaila","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":18282,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":18282}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-06T03:21:06Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mike & Jeanne Kataoka","image":371733}},{"id":988594,"name":"Ouwyece Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":" \nMadou  Il est celui qui a la corde du b\u0153uf en main c\u2019est un \u00e9leveur de b\u0153uf. \u00c2g\u00e9 de 42 ans, il est malien  et p\u00e8re 08 enfants dont quatre(4)  fr\u00e9quentent l\u2019\u00e9cole.\nSa femme est commer\u00e7ante et \u00e9leveuse de moutons et ch\u00e8vres.\nClient  fid\u00e8le et cr\u00e9dible du RMCR,Madou exerce l\u2019\u00e9levage il y a 7 ans de cela, il vend ses b\u0153ufs  au march\u00e9 non loin de sa localit\u00e9. \nIl a emprunt\u00e9 300 000FCFA pour augmenter son chiffre d\u2019affaire pour son activit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9levage.
