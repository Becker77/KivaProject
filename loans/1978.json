With it she will purchase dairy products, dry grains, bread, ingredients for Christmas foods, chicken, oil, eggs, sugar, and cleaning products.

She came to study at AUCA from the south part of Kyrgyzstan. She didn\u2019t choose to study ICP accidentally, but had made her mind up after some political issues in Kyrgyzstan. <br \/><br \/>The Kyrgyz Revolution of 2010, also known as the Second Kyrgyz Revolution, began in April, 2010, with the ousting of the Kyrgyz president in the capital Bishkek. It was followed by increased ethnic tension involving Kyrgyz people and Uzbeks in the south of the country, which escalated in June, 2010. The violence ultimately led to the consolidation of a new parliamentary system in Kyrgyzstan. <br \/><br \/>All of this brought many problems for the citizens of this country, and Alina wanted to find answers to her questions about why all this was happening in her Motherland.<br \/><br \/>Alina entered AUCA with a hope to become a big politician who could make a difference in her country in the future. She dreamed to study at AUCA, as it is accredited in Kyrgyzstan and in the USA, and it provides quality education in English, which opens good perspectives in her life. <br \/><br \/>Alina has a family of five, and she is the youngest child in her family. Her parents are retired and get a small pension from the state. <br \/><br \/>Thanks to the diligence of her elder sister, her sister studies in one of the universities of Moscow on a budgetary basis. Her elder brother is a sophomore at another local university. Alina\u2019s student life caused additional expenses for her family as now her parents have to pay for two students\u2019 tuition fees. They do gardening and raise cattle and sell them to earn extra money, but still the money is not enough to cover Alina\u2019s tuition. <br \/><br \/>Since Alina and her brother study in the capital, they have to rent a flat and pay for utilities, food and transportation. They are always short of money.<br \/><br \/>Having applied to AUCA, Alina and her family were happy to find out about a Kiva loan, which is provided at an interest-free rate to the AUCA student and can be paid back after her graduation. Alina thanks all Kiva lenders for their support and notes that Kiva is an indispensable loan for her and others in Kyrgyzstan."}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2041207,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for her higher education at AUCA.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Osh","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":326,"posted_date":"2015-12-04T13:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-03T13:40:02Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#FemaleEducation"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":67,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-04T17:00:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"kathleen melymuka","image":985313}},{"id":987847,"name":"Erick Mauricio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Erick, de 22 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta noveno grado, vive en casa de sus padres, su pap\u00e1 trabaja como jornalero en la alcald\u00eda del pueblo y su mam\u00e1 en los oficios del hogar. \n\nErick, trabaja como jornal en las labores agr\u00edcolas y como ayudante de alba\u00f1iler\u00eda en ocasiones en la misma comunidad. \n\nErick, necesita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar una yunta de terneros para engorde, con esto tendr\u00e1 ingresos a futuro y ser\u00e1 una forma de auto empleo para la \u00e9poca de verano. \n\nErick, sue\u00f1a con empezar a estudiar a distancia el bachillerato y as\u00ed poder aplicar a nuevas oportunidades laborales.\n","en":"Erick, 22, studied up to ninth grade.

Amadu is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family and looks forward to using his additional earnings to ensure that all his children get a post secondary education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2040346,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-12-04T14:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-03T14:30:13Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amadu ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":14835.5,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":14835.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-05T03:48:13Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":987849,"name":"Gloria Marina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gloria, tiene 33 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta primer grado, est\u00e1 soltera y vive con sus t\u00edas y una prima.\n\nGloria, se dedica a trabajar como empleada dom\u00e9stica y en la temporada escolar trabaja como cocinera en la escuela que est\u00e1 en su comunidad y en tiempo de vacaci\u00f3n trabaja con sus t\u00edas en la peque\u00f1a ganader\u00eda familiar.\n\nGloria, necesita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar una vaca para repasto, porque quiere aprovechar el forraje que queda del cultivo de ma\u00edz y del sorgo.\n\nGloria, sue\u00f1a con comenzar a construir una casa para ella.\n","en":"Gloria is 33 years old, she studied until the first grade, she is single, and lives with her aunts and a cousin. <br \/>Gloria works as a domestic employee and during the school season she works as a cook in the school of her community.

It greatly sustained her variety store business and helped cover her daily household and personal needs. Despite her status as single, she feels a sense of fulfillment that she is able to provide assistance to her siblings, nephews, and nieces.\r\n\r\nWhen CCT partnered with Kiva, it gave her better chances to avail higher loans that will further improve her business. Recently, her requested loan of 15,000 PHP was granted and went a long way. She bought more dry goods and grocery items, which she sold for additional profits.   \r\n\r\nThis time she's positive that you will trust her again. She's seeking for another 15,000 PHP loan to procure more quantities of groceries and cases of beverages. She puts forth her best effort to give the best service to her loyal and increasing customers.

Sabiu is thankful that he now has the opportunity to improve the life of his children and family, and looks forward to using his additional earnings to diversify his farm and grow other crops.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2041363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-12-04T16:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-03T16:30:02Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabiu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":12203.14,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":12203.14}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-06T08:19:12Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sandi Chamberlain","image":202541}},{"id":988959,"name":"Chanorn's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chanorn\u2019s group live in a rural village in Prey Veng province in Cambodia.

With Babban Gona\u2019s support, Ashiru will store the maize he harvests and delay it\u2019s sale until a date later in the season when he can obtain a significantly higher price for his maize, at a premium up to 37% more than the harvest price. <br \/><br \/>With the opportunity to earn up to $2,000 per hectare of land, Ashiru now has the opportunity to actualize his dream to grow his agriculture business for himself and family members, and would like to use this additional income to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2041665,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-12-04T22:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-03T22:30:05Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ashiru","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":14881.13,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":14881.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-05T17:49:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lynn Cerra","image":860417}},{"id":978302,"name":"Tiessiri Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Ass\u00e9tou est la personne qui pr\u00e9sente le mouton sur la photo, \u00e2g\u00e9 de 32 ans, elle est membre du groupe Ti\u00e9ssiri  constitu\u00e9 en majorit\u00e9 femmes, nationalit\u00e9 malienne mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 6 enfants dont 3 scolaris\u00e9s.\nAss\u00e9tou n\u2019a jamais fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9cole, r\u00e9side \u00e0 Saalo il y a 20 ans de cela, elle ach\u00e8te les moutons dans les march\u00e9s fait l'\u00e9levage pendant huit mois  et revend dans les grands march\u00e9s,elle peut gagner par mois 20 000 fcfa de profit. \nPour acheter plus de moutons, elle fait recourt au pr\u00eat RMCR afin de pouvoir continuer son \u00e9levage de mouton.

With Babban Gona\u2019s support, Salamatu can store her maize, and sell it in the future for up to 37% higher than the market price at harvest. <br \/><br \/>Salamatu is grateful to be part of the Babban Gona family, and in the end, hopes to use her increased earnings to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1948419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-12-04T23:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-03T23:00:04Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"volunteer_pick"},{"name":"volunteer_like"},{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salamatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":12526.09,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":12526.09}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-05T23:02:08Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maureen Wharton","image":null}},{"id":987895,"name":"Ely Merary","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ely, de 34 a\u00f1os de edad, estudio hasta bachillerato, no pudo continuar con sus estudios debido a la falta de apoyo de sus padres y la distancia; est\u00e1 acompa\u00f1ada, su pareja trabaja en construcci\u00f3n y ella es madre de dos j\u00f3venes. \n\nEly, tiene una tienda desde hace tres a\u00f1os, la coloco gracias a la motivaci\u00f3n de su madre y de su padre; pero aparte de eso ella trabaja tres d\u00edas a la semana en otra tienda, en donde le han apoyado para que ella se supere, mientras ella trabaja su esposo le ayuda a vender en su tienda cuando tiene tiempo. \n\nEly, necesita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar m\u00e1s productos de primera necesidad como az\u00facar, arroz, frijoles, ma\u00edz, aceite, leche, caf\u00e9, sal, huevos y otros productos para poder generar m\u00e1s ingresos que le permitan ir creciendo poco a poco con el negocio. \n\nEly, sue\u00f1a con incrementar su inventario y que su tienda sea rentable y tener muchos clientes en la comunidad.\n","en":"Ely is 34 and finished high school but couldn't continue her studies because of a lack of support from her parents and the distance.
