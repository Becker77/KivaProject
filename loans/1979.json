grade three education. He couldn't continue at school as his parents were poor. He is married, and his wife looks after the household. They have two children.<br \/><br \/>Since he was 12 years old, Roberto has worked on the land. His parents inspired him to take on this work so that he would be an upstanding man with an income to pay household expenses. Now he is grateful for this effort as he learned the work very well and knows how to grow maize.

With the opportunity to earn up to $2000 per Hectare of land, Jummai hopes to realize better yields and plans on using her additional income to acquire more land to put into the Babban Gona program."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2041501,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-12-05T21:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-04T21:20:05Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jummai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":18282,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":18282}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-05T21:25:22Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":988016,"name":"Ku\u00f1a Katupyry Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Ku\u00f1a Katupyry se form\u00f3 en la ciudad de It\u00e1,  es un grupo muy unido que trabaja ayud\u00e1ndose las unas a las otras, y de esa forma quieren poder ayudar a sus seres queridos.\nUna de las integrantes es la Sra.

Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long term as the cost of firewood will be reduced.

Phanice also decided to purchase a solar light as part of her loan, which she is very excited about, as it will allow her to have light during dark hours for her children to be able to study.\n\nObtaining this loan means that Phanice's Group will be able to receive a total of 6 solar lights, as well as farming inputs to plant a total of 6.5 acres.\""}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2034853,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Teso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-12-06T09:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-05T09:00:03Z","loan_amount":775,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Phanice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Petronila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josphat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Humphrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Okimong Silas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alfred","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":77600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":775}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-08T07:40:58Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":989640,"name":"Burambagira School","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Uganda!

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of their budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing two water filtration systems will therefore save the schools money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV and Tulip Filtration water treatment systems with 450 litre tank and 5 Sets of 20 Litre Buckets, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nBurambagira SS School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

Installing a water filtration system will, therefore, save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a Tulip Filtration water treatment system, with 5 sets of 20 litre buckets which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nShalom Primary School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

With Babban Gona\u2019s support, Bala will store the maize he harvests and delay it\u2019s sale until a date later in the season when he can obtain a significantly higher price for his maize at a premium up to 37% more than the harvest price. \nWith the opportunity to earn up to $2000 per Hectare of land, Bala now has the opportunity to actualize his dream to grow his agriculture business for himself and family members and would like to use this additional income to ensure that all his children get a post secondary education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1948060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-12-06T13:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-05T13:10:03Z","loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bala","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":10415.2,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":10415.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-06T20:28:16Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":989154,"name":"Saira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saira  is a hardworking woman.

She started this business with 10,000 som (KGS).\r\n\r\nThanks to Mira's persistent work, her farm currently has a cow and a horse. She also has a plot of land of 1.50 hectares, on which she grows haricots. Her business brings in around 4,500 som (KGS) per month. With an aim to further develop her business, Mira turned to the bank \"Bai Tushum\" for a loan in the amount of 35,000 som (KGS) to purchase a cow and increase her herd.
