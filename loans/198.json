I am teaching them about the business so that they can continue with it.  <p>This loan will be used to buy paper, ink, cardboard, stickers and other supplies\r\n\r\n<p>Entre mis clientes me llaman Quique, y soy due\u00f1o de una imprenta en la que hago libretas, postales, calendarios, calcomanias. Tengo varios a\u00f1os de tener mi negocio y tengo varios contratos con escuelas, colegios y otros negocios ambulantes. Mis clientes me prefieren por la calidad de producto que les brindo y los buenos precios que les ofrezco. Ahorita que es fin de a\u00f1o, la demanda crece en la elaboracion de calendarios, libretas y stickers, asi como los talonarios de pago de escuelas y colegios es por eso que necesito realizar una buena inversion en la compra de los materiales necesarios para atender a todos mis clientes. Soy padre de tres hijos a quienes les ense\u00f1e el negocio para que ellos continuen con este."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Printing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Compra de papel, tinta, cartulinas, sticker y otros","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Comayaguela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.133333 -86.383333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":5,"posted_date":"2006-11-06T17:49:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raul Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-11-20T22:49:58Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2006-12-06T16:17:01Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-08T00:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":2879},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-01-06T16:50:35Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-08T00:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":4005},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-02-06T13:21:54Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-08T00:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":6810},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-03-06T10:30:52Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-08T00:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9479},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-04-06T16:04:58Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-08T00:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":12492},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2007-05-07T15:41:34Z","settlement_date":"2007-05-08T00:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15406}],"funded_date":"2006-11-06T22:49:58Z","paid_date":"2007-05-07T15:41:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":5500,"name":"Kereta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kereta L. has a small fruit and vegetable farm for her business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This tall (or short) water pipe is used to smoke fruit-flavored tobacco. Ahmad requested a loan from Al Majmoua in order to purchase merchandise for his shop, like a billiard to attract younger customers and make his coffee shop a nice place to hang out and have a good time. This is his fourth loan cycle, and he has always paid on time. \r\n<p>\r\nAhmad's previous loans helped him start a new business selling scrap metal. This second business is a way to improve his income. Ahmad is an active man who does his best to improve his family's financial situation, and he even said that if he had more time, he would consider starting a third job. \r\n<p>\r\nAhmad is special in his work, because his clients feel comfortable coming to his shop and enjoying a nice coffee or drink with their narguileh. His clients are his friends, neighbors, passersby, and people from his region. When he first started his business, he had difficulty purchasing all the necessary merchandise for his shop.

Her previous loan of 14,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.

","en":"Mankanay is 54 years old, married, and has raised two children. During the Soviet times, Mankanay milked cows at a collective farm, while her husband operated a combine harvester. After collective farms ceased to exist, Mankanay and her husband decided to start their own farm, raising and selling animals. They started out in 1995, with 20,000 KGS, and today their farm brings in 10,000 KGS per month from sales of dairy and meat. Also, Mankanay grows various crops for the animals on her own land, allowing her to save money on feed. With the goal of increasing the number of heads of cattle on her farm, Mankanay has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 125,000 KGS, to purchase additional animals. Income from the loan will be used to expand her farm.

To spend her spare time, Gusti Ayu started her business in pig farming. All the capital of Rp 3,000,000 that she got from Dinari is used to purchase 1 female pig that cost Rp 1,000,000 and the rest is used for purchasing the pig food and raising the piglets. Now Gusti Ayu Putu Mertha has 9 piglets. She spends Rp 10,000 daily for the pig food. The pig food mixtures consist of rice and wheat chaff. When the piglets reach the age of 2 months, they can be sold for about Rp 200,000 each as the pigs that she raises are local pigs that are cheaper than the superior type of pigs. Gusti Ayu Putu Mertha really enjoys running this business because it has become her hobby and also she can earn additional income for her family.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kustini Lim, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nGusti Ayu Putu Mertha dan suaminya, Gusti Putu Ngurah Sutawan, sudah berkeluarga hampir 25 tahun. Tetapi sampai saat ini belum juga dikaruniai  anak. Untuk mengisi waktu yang terluang Gusti Ayu menyibukkan diri dengan usahanya yaitu beternak induk babi. Semua modal yang dipakai didapat dari  Dinari sebesar Rp. 3.000.000,-. Modal ini dipakai untuk membeli 1 induk babi yang harganya     Rp. 1.000.000,- sisanya untuk pakan dan pemeliharaan anaknya. Saat ini induk Gusti Ayu Putu Mertha memiliki anak 9 ekor. Untuk biaya pakan setiap hari menghabiskan modal Rp.10.000.-  Adapun campuran pakannya yaitu dedak padi dan dedak gandum. Setelah berumur kurang lebih  2 bulan, 9 ekor anak babi  ini baru bisa dijual dengan perkiraan  harga perekor mencapai  Rp. 200.000.- karena babi yang dipelihara adalah jenis lokal jadi harganya lebih murah dari babi jenis unggul. Gusti Ayu Putu Mertha sangat senang selain sebagai saluran hobinya, juga bisa menghasilkan pendapatan bagi keluarganya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":122385,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Naomi has 2 years of experience in this business.  Naomi needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Naomi joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Naomi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Naomi L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

V. was born in the district of Namaacha, Maputo province, in southern Mozambique.  She is 25 years old, married, and the mother of 3 children who are 10, 7, and 1 years old.  The two oldest go to school.  She only finished the 8th grade; she was not able to continue on due to an early pregnancy.  She lives in her own home with her family and does not support anybody else.\r\n\r\nShe left Namaacha for Boane with her parents when she was very young.  Later on, she married her husband and they decided to get their own place.  She has had her own business in Boane for more than 2 years.  She doesn't have any employees but her husband, who is an automotive electrician at a Petromoc service station, helps her out.  She earns about 4,000 MZN monthly, and with her husband's help with household expenses, is able to save some in her Millennium Bim bank account.\r\n\r\nShe has not had loans with other banks.  She found out about Hluvuku through her mother, who works in the same area and is also a client of the institution.  This is Margarida's second loan, which has a value of 15,000 MZN.  She plans to use it to buy construction materials (cement, support beams, sand, zinc plates, etc.) in order to continue building her house.  The previous loan was for 9,250 MZN, for the same purpose.  She promises to  pay back the loan in a timely manner in order to be able to have access to others.  In the future, she would like to request more loans in order to continue with the construction of her house.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Erika Korowin, Kiva

M. started a business six years ago in the Concord of Malambo neighborhood, a municipality 10 minutes from Barranquilla, where she lives with her two children, ages 19 and 24 years.  She began selling fabric paints and supplies for the production of dummies and she taught people how to manufacture these products.  From there her permanent clientele grew and Sonia achieved the goal of becoming a recognized point of sale.  She is a wise woman   who learns and teaches everything she can.  She is qualified in foam crafts and in the production of sandals through the National Learning Service \"SEINE\".  Four years ago she began to sell the supplies for these same products, taking advantage of the fact that many people who were qualified in the skills undertook micro-businesses producing these crafts.  This has assured her a permanent market.  At present Sonia lives with her youngest son.  She is paying for his studies in Psychology thanks to her work in the micro-business, where she sells what she manufactures and also the commodities, materials and supplies of many crafts that she also practices.  Currently she is requesting a loan to buy linings for templates, gallons of glue, platforms, thread, buttons, fabrics, foam and glitter, in order to be prepared for the month of December to make footwear and Christmas decorations, an art that she also knows perfectly.  She expects to increase her sales by 30% since at this time of year the number of clients asking for these articles grows considerably.  On the other hand the production of footwear and of Christmas articles by other micro-businesses dedicated to these activities also increases, and they buy the supplies for their production from Sonia.  Sonia joined the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation 2 years ago and this is her second loan.  With the first one she managed to enlarge her working capital a little and to add new clients.  Her greatest challenge the previous year occurred when there was a decrease in her sales but she managed to add new product lines and thus has managed to maintain her business.  Among her achievements is the recent purchase of her dwelling in this same neighborhood.

Maricel B. knows this truth and grabs every opportunity that comes her way. Maricel, 36, attended college and now is married to Salvador, who works as a branch manager of a pizza chain in town.  Maricel works hard to help her husband earn for their daily needs and prepare financially for the future of their elementary grade child. Together, they live in Pasay City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nMaricel currently runs a sari-sari (variety) store, in which she sells items that are needed daily by neighbors in her community. Products on her shelves range from soap to candies and energy drinks to rice. Having been at least seven years in business, she knows how to pay her dues on time. She also has an excellent reputation with her fellow community partners in CCT* and, most important, her customers. Monthly, she is able to earn an average of 10000 Philippines pesos (PHP).\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a 20000 PHP loan. She intends to use this money to purchase more products for her store, all the more needed now that the Christmas season is here. Maricel plans to take this opportunity to drive her business toward more profitability.\r\n\r\nMaricel is never without challenges, both in her business and personal life.

She earns her living by operating a business selling cosmetics. Her husband Joel D. J., who is 40 years old, works as a government employee to earn his living. They have two children who are 7 and 9 years old. The children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores. Donna May joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Donna May has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use for additional capital for her cosmetics business to continue to save up for the future education of her children. Donna May is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She took advantage of the fact that the primary product is cheese and it is a product that she buys in larger quantities. This is another business that earns a second source of income and it has done very well. She also sells complimentary products that she prepares, such as frozen fruit snacks. She prepares them with natural fruits from the region, such as soursop, mango, coconut, and even chocolate. Her greatest dream is to give her business a better infrastructure and to be able to support the person and professional development of her family. As she works towards her goals she works with a contribution margin of 61.29%. She is very eager to increase her working capital to expand her products. This is exactly the reason why she requests a Kiva loan, a first time loan through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). With it she will purchase kitchen implements such as a galvanized steel table, a heated display, and a pizza oven. She will be able to profit from her husband's technical knowledge with respect to the preparation of these products. She plans to have an affect on the community especially because there is not much competition in their neighborhood and surrounding areas. Her goal is to generate more income.

Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns a minimum of 350 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business.\r\n\r\nShe expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nElsa hopes her business will grow into a mini-grocery and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

Ten years ago Minerva began to selling grocery items, buying small quantities of bread and milk to sell.  She needed to start this business because her husband's salary was not enough to cover the education of their three children.  The two oldest have now completed their university studies, and the youngest continues her studies and helps her mother with the business.  During the last ten years, Minerva has expanded the range of products she offers.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> However, lately her customers have been requesting items that she doesn't carry, so they've gone to the competition.  Now Minerva can't generate enough income to cover the costs of her daughter's education,  so she is requesting a loan, to be paid back in 6 months, to purchase additional merchandise such as office supplies (paper, pens and pencils, notebooks).   By winning back her customers and growing her income, she will be able to achieve her dream that her daughter finishes university.  With your help Minerva will be able to give her daughter a better future.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\nHace 10 a\u00f1os que Minerva comenz\u00f3 la venta de abarrotes comprando un poco de leche pan y latas. Minerva tubo que comenzar este negocio  puesto que no les alcanzaba con el sueldo de su esposo para pagar los estudios de sus 3 hijos de los cuales los 2 mayores lograron terminar la universidad satisfactoriamente y la m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a continua estudiando y por las tardes le ayuda a Minerva en el negocio. En estos 10 a\u00f1os Minerva a logrado aumentar la gama de productos en su tienda.<p>\r\n\r\nSin embargo sus clientes le han pedido \u00faltimamente art\u00edculos que ella no posee esto hace que su clientela se vallan con la competencia y por lo tanto no puede adquirir tantos ingresos como ella desear\u00eda para poder pagar los gastos de la universidad de su hija. Es por esto que Minerva esta solicitando un cr\u00e9dito de US $750, que esta dispuesta a pagarlos en un plazo de 6 meses, con este dinero Minerva podr\u00e1 comprar mas mercanc\u00eda como papeler\u00eda (libretas, l\u00e1pices, plumas, colores entre otras cosas) y asi poder cumplir su sue\u00f1o, que su hija termine la Universidad. Con tu ayuda Minerva podr\u00e1 sacar adelante a su hija.\r\n\r\n<p> Translated by Kiva volunteer, Emily Charnes <\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":108348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL MERCHANDISE FOR HER SMALL SHOP SO HER COMPETITION DOESN'T TAKE HER CUSTOMERS AWAY,  AND INCREASE HER INCOME SO THAT SHE CAN PAY FOR HER DAUGHTER TO FINISH UNIVERSITY.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Montemorelos, Nuevo Le\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2007-12-31T13:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Minerva","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-14T15:16:42Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2008-01-31T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-30T09:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":125163},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2008-02-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-30T09:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144592},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2008-03-31T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-30T09:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":169842},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2008-04-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-30T09:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196079},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2008-05-31T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-30T09:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":223884},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2008-06-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-30T09:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":252466}],"funded_date":"2007-12-31T15:16:42Z","paid_date":"2008-06-30T09:04:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":34205,"name":"Sin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sin S., age, 29, works selling a variety of vegetables, making on average around $2.50 each day.

She now serves french fries and hot dogs, desserts, beverages, etc. What she most wants is to see her children grow up with a good education; thus together with her husband\u2019s income as an electric technician almost all of their income is spent on their children\u2019s future.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Eliza Wethey, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nTodos los d\u00edas, desde hace quince a\u00f1os, Carmen se dedica \u00edntegramente a su fuente de soda.

Evonne also plans to contribute 100,000 CFA ($200 USD) of her personal savings towards these purchases.  \r\n \r\nThis is Evonne's fifth loan from GHAPE; she has been a member since 2004. She has been working in her \"buyam sellam\" business for a number of years now and has since found the items she sells from suppliers; this ensures she gets the best prices on these items. Evonne now has many customers who come to her for all of their vegetables. She allows some people to create tabs with her for their purchases and pay her at the end of the month. Her contribution to her community provides them with these items in closer proximity to their community, cutting down on their travel costs and the time involved in searching for these items.\r\n \r\nWith the profits from this loan, Evonne plans to send her children to school and support them after school. She will also consider adding other food stuffs to her stall.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

Her disappointments about life being poor are oftentimes overtaken by excitement to face more challenge because of the inspiration brought about by her husband and children.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Angelita joined ASHI and requested a loan which she used to start up a buy and sell business. Now, she is requesting a much larger loan, wanting to grow her business, and profits as well, to be able to improve her family\u2019s lifestyle.\r\n\r\nAngelita\u2019s husband supports her decision in this because he saw from her previous loan that she is happy having her business and spending her profits on the needs of their children, especially for their education.

Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb T. (10107010029) is a 33-year-old female living in the town of \u0110\u00f4ng Anh - H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i.  T. is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by SEDA.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is L\u1ef1c Canh 3 (6).\r\n\r\nT. is married and has one infant child.  To make a living, T. makes and sells a variety of food products in the local community.  T. has been engaged in this business for over seven years and earns approximately $165 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  T. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.028.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  She is now requesting a new loan of 4.578.000 VND which will again be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This will be her 5th loan from SEDA.  T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.

Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.

M. was born in the district of Manjacaze, Gaza province, in southern Mozambique.  She is 52 years old, single, and the mother of 2 children who are 17 and 15 years old.  Both of them go to school.  She only completed the 8th grade and did not continue because of a lack of financial means.  She lives in her own home with her children and also supports 2 grandchildren who live with her.\r\n\r\nShe left Manjacaze for Xai-Xai when she was very young because of her father's job transfer.  In 2000, she left Xai-Xai for Boane where she established her home.  She has had her own business for more than 12 years.  She works around 12 hours each day and doesn't have any employees.  She sells hair extensions and earns about 6,000 MZN per month, which she uses to pay for household expenses.  She even saves some monthly through Xitique (a traditional rotating savings system).\r\n\r\nShe had a previous loan with the GUEGUE Credit Association, but did not continue with them for various reasons.  She found out about Hluvuku through her neighbor, who is also a client of the institution.  She is her 4th loan, which has a value of 15,000 MZN.  She plans to use it to buy supplies (bundles of used clothing, hair products, shoes, etc.) in order to increase her stock.  The previous loans were for 9,000 MZN, 13,000 MZN, and 13,000 MZN, all for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay back the loan in a timely manner so she can have access to others.  In the future, she would like to request more loans to use for her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Erika Korowin, Kiva

With her entrepreneurial spirit, Melody saw an unfilled need and decided to launch a babysitting placement service in April, 2008. \r\n\r\nMelody's business has brought independence to her life. The flexibility of being her own boss allows her to still continue her career as a singer and performer in New York City and spend more time with her son.\r\n\r\nMelody found traditional bank loans too costly and difficult to acquire. She was recommended to ACCION USA for an affordable, small business loan. Melody will use her ACCION USA loan to purchase another computer for her growing staff, to provide age-appropriate toys for babysitters, and to ramp up her promotional efforts. Her vision is to expand her babysitting service; therefore, creating more jobs and at the same time raising awareness on the importance of child development.\r\n\r\n<b>About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the new caf\u00e9 on your corner and the delivery service that brings the fresh baked goods acquired the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated 10 million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis.\u201d Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education. \r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild the economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":516652,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Child

She is very grateful to the institution for its support.\t<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":601380,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-09-18T00:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patricia Gina \t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":58.15},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":69.45},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":75.13},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":83.72},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":84.55},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":88.53},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":91.44},{"due_date":"2011-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":95.46},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":98.87},{"due_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":103.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.15},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.45},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.13},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.12},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.72},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.55},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.53},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.44},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.46},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.87},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.15,"local_amount":58.15,"processed_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:38:53Z","rounded_local_amount":58.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177394042},{"amount":69.45,"local_amount":69.45,"processed_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:48:50Z","rounded_local_amount":69.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182532485},{"amount":73.33,"local_amount":73.33,"processed_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":73.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188669026},{"amount":75.13,"local_amount":75.13,"processed_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:59:00Z","rounded_local_amount":75.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191412455},{"amount":78.12,"local_amount":78.12,"processed_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-25T09:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":78.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195830881},{"amount":83.72,"local_amount":83.72,"processed_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:52:44Z","rounded_local_amount":83.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201273243},{"amount":84.55,"local_amount":84.55,"processed_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":84.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206140403},{"amount":88.53,"local_amount":88.53,"processed_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":88.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211213335},{"amount":91.44,"local_amount":91.44,"processed_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:57:50Z","rounded_local_amount":91.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216491740},{"amount":95.46,"local_amount":95.46,"processed_date":"2011-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:41:40Z","rounded_local_amount":95.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221655055},{"amount":98.87,"local_amount":98.87,"processed_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:54:23Z","rounded_local_amount":98.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227022987},{"amount":103.25,"local_amount":103.25,"processed_date":"2011-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":103.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232782183}],"funded_date":"2010-09-18T16:12:16Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T08:48:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

She is now requesting a new loan of 7.392.000 VND, which will be used to purchase a new sewing machine.  The loan will be her fourth loan from SEDA.

She is 40 years old. Wilma is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Wilma is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Wilma joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. \r\n\r\nWilma is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be her 10th loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They both know how to read and write and have four dependent children who are in school.  They have lived in the north of Colomi, in a community called Rodeo Alto-Candelaria for the past ten years.  They own some cattle (both for meat and milk).\r\n\r\nOctavio tells us that he is investing some savings that he had in building his house so that his family can live more comfortably.  They are farmers and every year they grow potatoes, <i>papaliza<\/i> and <i>oca<\/i> (native tubers) and beans.  He came to request a loan in order to buy a plot of farmland.\r\n\r\nFinally, Octavio tells us that they feel very happy to have received a positive response and to know they have a good future ahead of them.

She lives in Ica, a city currently characterized by increased investment, not only in the sector of food exports, i.e. in farms, but also in the opening of new shopping centers which offer many jobs to residents of Ica. In her spare time Roxana enjoys a good book or watches her favorite TV programs. It is well known that Peru has the most delicious food in the world. One of Roxana's favorite dishes is \"Carapulcra con Sopa Seca\", a typical dish of southern Peru, made from pork, groundnuts, potatoes, noodles and chicken. Roxana is a teacher, but communication science is what she would have liked to study. She is married and her husband drives a motor taxi. They have three children, aged 4, 10 and 16. Their youngest child goes to kindergarten, their second one is in fifth grade of elementary school and the eldest in fifth grade of secondary school.\n\nRoxana sells clothes to housewives in her neighborhood and to her colleagues at the school where she works. She spends approximately two hours a day with this activity. Roxana got the incentive to launch this business from her husband who had noticed her skill with this kind of activity.\n\nOn an average day she serves two customers, which gives her an average income of 75 new soles per day. On a good day she can earn 100 new soles, which helps her to pay for additional household expenditures. Her business is successful because she is friendly with her customers who recommend her for her good service. She is very grateful to Kiva lenders because this loan enables her to buy additional clothes for her business and have a greater product range on offer. \n\nThis improvement will help Roxana to have more variety of clothes to offer and thus more sales and more income. In a few months she could have a car. However, her biggest dreams are to provide her children with a good education, so that they may become successful professionals, as well as to own a boutique for her clothing business and a transportation company.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":959638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

At this time she is seven months pregnant. Liliana and her family live in Imperial, a cozy city south of Lima (the capital). Imperial is a very calm city where one can see the Afroperuvian influence. The people make a living in agriculture and producing the flagship product of Pisco (a liquor). Liliana and her husband both work to provide for their growing family, and it's for this reason her husband is currently making a living as a baker. Liliana also was working, but because of her pregnancy she can't continue as a grocer's assistant, where she only earned tips for her services. To make headway and to increase the income she was making, she and her husband were able to purchase a car, which they have rented out as a taxi for the past two years. She also has dedicated a lot of time to the car's care so that it generates the necessary revenue. Currently, Liliana has been able to scrape together a little bit of money, and she hopes you lend them the remaining sum to repair the car's engine, which is very damaged. Thanks to this help she will be able to finish her pregnancy peacefully and she and her husband won't have to worry about the

In the beginning, his business was not big and could be placed on a small counter. Munavvar in that time was looking after her small son. Gradually the son became older and she started to help her husband to trade. She came to Microinvest 4 years ago, when they started from a small amount of $60. This money they spent as current capital. The business grew and it was time to think about their expansion of trade. The spouses decided to rent a small store. Today her business is a store with an assortment of goods, from food products to industrial goods. All their family is involved in the business and the spouses can live to trade with their children.

Two of Battsetseg's children are university students, while her youngest daughter is a high school student. Although her husband runs a small carpentry shop, their income was not adequate to pay the family\u2019s monthly expenses, which is especially burdensome with two children attending university. Hence, she decided to start a small private business to boost her family's income. She rents a small stall in the local shopping mall and sells wool and cashmere products.

A batey is a small rural community built by a sugar company to house their field workers. Bateyes are usually isolated with little or no access to electricity, potable running water, or medical services. Santa Lucia is particularly remote, and the community is quite small. Despite those difficulties, Santa has a successful business selling clothing to her community. With this loan, her second with Esperanza International, Santa plans on purchasing more merchandise and styles of clothing to sell to her customers.\r\n\r\nSanta\u2019s dream is to eventually be able to sell clothing in other communities. Before she had access to loans, this dream could never come true. Now, it is almost within reach as her business grows and she increases her profits.

Her first was for 1,000,000 colones over twenty-four months and was dispersed in 2003. Lisbeth owned a corner store but, unfortunately, she had to close down the project because three mini-supermarkets opened in close proximity to her small store. The competition was too much and she was crowded out of the market.\r\n\r\nNot to be deterred by the breakdown of her first enterprise, Lisbeth has since opened a beauty salon named \u201cLisbet\u2019s Salon\u201d. She has two years of experience working in salons and so, five months ago, she decided to open her own business. For the last five months, she has been working hard to keep the salon profitable.\r\n\r\nBusiness hours are from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., Tuesday to Saturday. Lisbeth works alone in her salon and offers a range of services including manicures, pedicures, haircuts and hair extensions. In a good month she earns 400,000; in bad months 160,000. The loan officer that has been working with Lisbeth describes her as hardworking with a fighting spirit and a strong history of punctual repayments.The current loan will be used to invest in her new business.\r\n\r\nLisbeth is applying for this loan to reinforce her working capital. She will use the loan to invest in general activities conducive to the growth of her salon. This last year was hard on business but in January her products and services have become popular in her community.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, Lisbeth will use this loan to buy a swivel chair to replace her old one in an effort to provide better service to her clients.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Epenesa has many years of experience in this business.  Epenesa needs a loan of WST $1000 to rent land to raise additional crops.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Epenesa joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Epenesa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Epenesa L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He works together with his brothers. Azam, together with his wife, have 3 children to support. Azam has asked for a loan of $1400 USD to purchase more grocery products, allowing him to expand his options and increase his inventory. He believes that this will allow him to reach a wider customer base so he can increase his income to help provide for his family. Azam looks forward to seeing the results of this investment and hopes that his family can become more economically secure for the future. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They are now very happily working in their second cycle with the Committee of Entrepreneurial Women Program.\r\n\r\nSilvia has a henhouse that is very well established.

Taking into account the consumption of poultry instead of beef due to the economy, she now has good, fixed customers.\r\n\r\nShe wishes to expand her business by purchasing more chicks.  She will also purchase balanced feed and equipment to provide for the chicks.

Muy pronto cosechar\u00e1 25 sacos de papa y 15 sacos de habas, con los que obtendr\u00e1 una buena ganancia, y as\u00ed incrementar sus ahorros con los que piensa muy pronto comprar su propio terreno. Ella pertenece al banco comunal \u201cSan jer\u00f3nimo de Queta\u201d, y este es el s\u00e9ptimo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, donde se siente realizada, pues el apoyo que recibe de su asociaci\u00f3n le ayuda en la mejora de sus cultivos. Nelly, dentro de estos meses cosechar\u00e1 papa, por ello con el cr\u00e9dito est\u00e1 pensando comprar 2 bolsas de semilla de arveja y varios sacos de papa, los cuales esparcir\u00e1 en sus terrenos agr\u00edcolas, despu\u00e9s de su cosecha. \n\n","en":"Nelly is 23 years old and a hard-working woman.  She lives together with her husband Jos\u00e9 and her 6 year-old son Daniel, in a rental house, in the town of Tapo.  Nelly has been farming since she was young.  She started 7 years ago.  Over the years she has learned farming techniques and also the knowledge needed in order to be able to make progress and get ahead.  Her main crops are potatoes, peas and beans which she grows on rented land.  What Nelly most likes about her work is being able to share with her husband the desire to get ahead since they both go out to work every day.  The most difficult part of her work is obtaining her own working capital and the expenses that she incurs in paying the annual rent on her land and her son's education expenses.\r\n\r\nVery soon, Nelly will harvest 25 sacks of potatoes and 15 sacks of beans which will make her good profits and this will increase her savings with which she is planning to buy her own plot of land very soon.  Nelly belongs to the \"San Jer\u00f3nimo de Queta\" community bank and this is her seventh loan with MFP where she feels fulfilled since the support that she receives from her association helps her to improve her crops.  In a few months Nelly will harvest her potatoes and is planning to use her loan money to buy 2 bags of pea seeds and several sacks of potato which she will spread over her farmland after her harvest."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":729751,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy pea seeds and sacks of organic manure","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-15T11:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2008.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245035}],"funded_date":"2011-03-15T15:22:39Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":285011,"name":"Juvencia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juvencia B., age 58, owns and operates a general store, where she buys and sells such items as canned goods, snack foods, shampoo, soap, and biscuits to members of the local community.

Her primary cultivations are of wheat, potatoes, barley, peas, and corn. She also raises cows and bulls to sell them at the livestock fairs. At the time of the harvest her wholesale buyers come to her fields to purchase everything that was produced. This is how she generates an income for herself and she is able to save on the transportation costs associated with the trip to the central market of the city. She and her husband have realized that their business is a good field of work especially because the difficulties they have encountered throughout the years have been overcome and because they have managed to improve the quality of their life. She has been working with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) for many years and she has always demonstrated responsibility with her loans and she inspires the same attitude among the other members of the group.

She and her partner have no children, but she has four children from her previous marriage. She now lives with her partner in a home of their own, and together they're working to have a better life. Marjjie sells refreshments at town events. She and her partner have a truck that they use to transport cargo. There are events every weekend, so she takes her supplies to set up her stand, where she ministers to the thirst and hunger of the attendees. She has been doing this work for five years on her own, but her partner helps her with transporting her things and also contributes to the family income by using the truck to tranport passengers. What she likes best about her work is that it gives her time to do a lot at home. Her business is going well, as she attends a lot of events and has good sales, enough to pay her bills.

She usually takes her products in her truck, and also takes Artemio\u2019s products with her so they can share their freight expenses. \r\nArtemio wakes up at 4 am every morning. He prepares his food, feeds his guinea pigs and, around 9 am he is already heading to the farm. Every Friday, he harvest his items and then he goes to the river to wash the carrots, lettuce, spinach, and then he puts the spinach in baskets, the carrots in sacks.  Every Saturday, around 3 am, he transports them to the city. \r\nThis activity is very important to him, as it is to every person who harvests vegetables. Besides, it is very profitable, especially during the months of January and March, as after that season the prices always drop. \r\nThis is the sixth time he requests for a loan from Microfinanzas Prisma, and he has never had a problem making his payments.

Tolib, who lives in Pendjikent, Tajikistan, is dedicated to the cattle business to which he attends very diligently in his community. From very early in the morning he tends the animals and he returns in the afternoons, having been exposed to the sun and exhausted from all this. He does this in order to bring food to his table for his spouse and beloved four children. Tolib says that he works with only one aim in mind - to provide his children with a proper education.\r\n<p>\r\nNow, Tolib would like to expand his business and purchase two calves. For this purpose, he has applied for $400 USD and with your help he hopes to reach his aim. Be an important part of the growth of Tolib\u2019s business.\r\n<p><br>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

and her small son, Rub\u00e9n, who is barely one and a half years old.  Rub\u00e9n is the motor that drives her to get ahead.  Because she had to support her baby by herself, she became a merchant selling groceries (basic needs items).  Her father helps her in the business.  She also started selling clothes a year ago.  \r\n\r\nShe is aware that she had her son very young.  She had a lot of professional plans that were thwarted.  But, she knew how to assume the roll of being a mother.  Her son is the reason for her efforts.  She has made various customers by selling clothes, and they always place lots of orders for the latest styles in the market.  This allows her to get greater income, and she considers her activity profitable.  For the future she plans to save in order to give her son an adequate quality of life.  Above all, she wants to give him a good education.  She plans to set up a clothing store to distribute her products wholesale and retail.  She also wants to have modeling shows with the creations she will make later.  She wants to study design and fashion.\r\n\r\nThis is Jhomaira\u2019s first loan with MFP.  She is sure that she will make her payments punctually because she wants to access more loans that will allow her to grow economically.  That way she will improve her general situation.  She says that she likes to work with the members of her communal bank because she knows them very well.  She plans to use the money from the loan to buy clothing and footwear.  Her customers have asked for these items, and she will take advantage of the Christmas season.  She expects to have good earnings.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":459628,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buy merchandise for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-28T20:50:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jhomaira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:31Z","rounded_local_amount":168.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124397},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:07Z","rounded_local_amount":168.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960138},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":168.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992982},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:40Z","rounded_local_amount":168.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717768},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":168.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751444},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:43Z","rounded_local_amount":166.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933893}],"funded_date":"2009-12-28T23:55:38Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":169729,"name":"Araba","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Araba is a 36-year-old woman who is divorced and the mother of two children.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of bingo in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/Bingo#\r\n\r\nLuaupu joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Luaupu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Luaupu F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She has owned a shop since 2007. She sells toys for children, dishes, home cleaning products, groceries and many other things. When she first started her business, she wasn\u2019t able to offer a large quantity of merchandise, therefore she decided to have various kinds of merchandise and offer all she could to her clients. Her clients are her friends, neighbors and tourists. \r\n\r\n<p>She decided to open her shop because she always wanted to have work of her own and to be self-reliant.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

business ventures:   general store, buying and selling of crabs and shrimp, and transportation businesses. She lives in Brgy. 2, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1997 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her general store, buying and selling of crabs and shrimp and transportation businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP16,000. Amalyn is now borrowing PHP 27,000 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 15th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom.\r\n\r\nAmalyn aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\n About NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is 23 years old.  Delmar is married and has 1 infant-aged child.  To make a living, Delmar owns and operates a transportation business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing motorcycle transport services in the local community.  Delmar has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Delmar joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Delmar has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI.  Delmar is requesting a new loan of 16,000 PHP which will be used to purchase equipment to improve the business.  This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Delmar from ASKI.  He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She makes her home here in a simple structure with her husband and two children. She says that her most difficult challenge is the plan she has to get a divorce. In the meantime, she plans to continue enjoying sharing with her entire family (parents and others) and cooking.\r\n\r\nBalbina is excited to be taking her 6th loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She has had her business for 5 years, starting with a loan she had. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying different beauty and cosmetic products. She will use the profits to buy some medicine for her mother and save because she wants to have a bigger locale for her business. Her goal is to have a bigger salon and a clothing store.\r\n \r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she prefer Esperanza's payments and the unity it creates by having group loans, and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally. Her group is located in Puerto Plata, a port town on the north coast where the economy is based on tourism. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":651079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy beauty products and cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Puerto Plata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19.75 -70.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2010-11-25T17:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Balbina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leonora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Georgina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":4048.57},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":3857.48},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3929.49},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":4002.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4077.55},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4153.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4231.2},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":4310.19},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":4390.65},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":4472.6},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":4556.09},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3969.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":109.31},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.15},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.1},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.08},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.09},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.15},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":114.24},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.38},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.54},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.76},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.02},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":107.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":109.31,"local_amount":4048.57,"processed_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":4071.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534148},{"amount":104.15,"local_amount":3857.48,"processed_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":3879.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534149},{"amount":106.1,"local_amount":3929.49,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:19:31Z","rounded_local_amount":3952.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534150},{"amount":108.08,"local_amount":4002.83,"processed_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:59:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4025.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188670912},{"amount":347.94,"local_amount":12886.7,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:02:52Z","rounded_local_amount":12960.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414236},{"amount":112.86,"local_amount":4180.09,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:34:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4204.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195991116},{"amount":362.28,"local_amount":13417.84,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:54:50Z","rounded_local_amount":13494.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201275188},{"amount":99.28,"local_amount":3677,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:54:35Z","rounded_local_amount":3698.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206142449}],"funded_date":"2010-11-29T05:59:34Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:54:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":256344,"name":"Biasha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Biasha is a married woman with six children.

Considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus productos desde la chacra hasta la ciudad de san francisco; lugar donde le ofrecen mejores precios por sus productos; con el cr\u00e9dito solicitado contratara jornaleros para que le apoyen en el desmonte de malezas que aquejan sus plantaciones.\nPero ahora lo que m\u00e1s prioriza es comprar mas semillas de cacao ya que cuenta con espacio suficiente para cultivar. Este es cr\u00e9dito numero 01 con MFP, esta dispuesto a pagar todas sus cuotas puntualmente, ya que desea acceder a otro cr\u00e9dito m\u00e1s adelante. En su banco comunal es un socio muy participe.\nCon los 1,000 nuevos soles contratara jornaleros para que le apoyen en el desmonte de malezas que aquejan sus plantaciones.\n\n\n\n","en":"Julio, aged 62, is married to Domitila, aged 52. As a result of their relationship they have two children: Hern\u00e1n is 23 years old and Reina 14. They live happily together in their own house. Julio is a man who puts a lot of effort every day into providing the best for his children. He is a farmer with 6 hectares of land, where he has been growing cacao plants for the past 15 years. At harvest time he counts on the support of hired day laborers and thus the fruit is quickly harvested and sold to wholesalers who pay him a very good price for each kilogram of his goods. Julio says that his biggest challenge is to transport the goods from the farm to the city of San Francisco, a place where he gets a better price.\r\n\r\nJulio applies for this loan of 1000 new soles to hire day laborers to weed his plantations. But currently his highest priority is to buy cacao seeds because he has enough acreage to plant them. This is his first loan with the microfinance institution Microfinanzas Prisma. He is committed to pay the installments on time, because later on he wants to have access to another loan. He is very involved in his communal bank.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":977851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire day laborers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-13T23:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":109.6},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":113.6},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":119.61},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":122.12},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":126.57},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":131.68},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":136.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":140.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.1},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.6},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.85},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.8},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.46},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.38},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.13},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.1,"local_amount":109.6,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":110.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246252},{"amount":42.6,"local_amount":113.6,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:49Z","rounded_local_amount":114.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386263},{"amount":44.85,"local_amount":119.61,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:37Z","rounded_local_amount":120.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099355},{"amount":45.8,"local_amount":122.12,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":123.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713501},{"amount":47.46,"local_amount":126.57,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":127.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202393},{"amount":49.38,"local_amount":131.68,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:58Z","rounded_local_amount":132.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287098074},{"amount":51.13,"local_amount":136.33,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:56Z","rounded_local_amount":137.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400933},{"amount":52.68,"local_amount":140.49,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:31Z","rounded_local_amount":141.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455449}],"funded_date":"2012-01-16T18:00:34Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robert Mouris","image":538858}},{"id":383406,"name":"Resty","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Resty sells newspapers at the roadside on a retail basis.
