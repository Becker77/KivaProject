The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of their budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children.

Su negocio es exitoso porque las presas de pollo son grandes en relaci\u00f3n al precio de la comida. La ventaja de su negocio es que cuenta con ventas diarias, la desventaja es la falta de muebles de comedor para atender a m\u00e1s clientes. Su sue\u00f1o es tener otro puesto de venta, ella desea comprar mesas y sillas  para vender comida a m\u00e1s clientes. Esta es la 1 secuencia de pr\u00e9stamos con la instituci\u00f3n en 5 a\u00f1os que realiza esta actividad.\nEs por esos motivos que Sarah solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar mesas y sillas para vender pollo a la broaster.\n","en":"Sarah is 35 years old.  She lives with her partner and has 3 children, ages 3, 10 and 18.  Her business is selling Broaster style ( pressure fried) chicken.  <br \/><br \/>She is very entrepreneurial, friendly and hardworking.  Her business is located in the 'Nuevo dia' neighborhood, which was set up to shelter survivors when the river flooded years ago.  Now it is a thriving manufacturing area.  <br \/><br \/>Sarah has brown skin, long black hair and a robust figure (seated on the left in the photo and dressed in a purple shirt).  Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed, which she speaks in with her family.  She speaks Spanish for general culture and in her business.  She shares her life with her partner who works as a bus driver, and with her children who attend school.  The family lives in a rented room constructed of brick with a corrugated tin roof and a concrete floor.  It has potable water, electricity and plumbing.  <br \/><br \/>The desire to improve her business drove her to set up a lending group.  The businesses of the members are:  a green grocer, sales of second-hand clothing, a taxi service, a repair shop for appliances, a neighborhood store, a book store, and egg sales.   Her business is selling Broaster style chicken.  She does this from noon to midnight everyday.  <br \/><br \/> \u201cEvery serving of chicken I comes with French fries and rice.  Customers are always satisfied after eating my chickens...\", she comments.  Her business is successful because the servings of chicken are large relative to the price of the meal.  The advantage of her business is that she has daily sales.  The disadvantage is that she doesn't have enough dining furniture to serve more customers.  Her dream is to have another location.  She wants to buy more tables and chairs to sell food to more customers.  This is her first loan cycle with the bank in the five years that she has had her business.  <br \/><br \/>For these reasons Sarah is requesting a loan to purchase tables and chairs to sell Broaster style chicken."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2040803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy tables and chairs to sell Broaster  style chicken.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-12-06T22:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-05T22:40:02Z","loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#FirstLoan"},{"name":"#WomanOwnedBiz"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Urbana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marinela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adelaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1334.47},{"due_date":"2015-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1382.15},{"due_date":"2016-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1407.31},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":1432.93},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1459.01},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1485.56},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1512.59},{"due_date":"2016-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1540.13},{"due_date":"2016-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1568.16},{"due_date":"2016-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1596.69},{"due_date":"2016-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1625.76},{"due_date":"2016-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1655.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.61},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":201.56},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":205.23},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.97},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.77},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.65},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":220.59},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.6},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":228.69},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.85},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.09},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":241.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michele Magrino","image":387464}},{"id":989937,"name":"Delia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Delia is a married woman with two children.

Her business is making blankets from sheeps' wool.  She is strong, dedicated, and very hardworking.  She runs her business in the \"Huarina\" area, which is 35 kilometers from the city, and close to the sacred lake Titicaca.  The citizens of the area work mainly in agriculture, fishing, and livestock farming.  It has a cold and dry climate with a maximum temperature of 10 degrees centigrade.  She has tan skin, long black hair which she braids, and dresses in the traditional way (hat, blanket, and skirt).  <br \/><br \/>She shares her life with her husband, who works in fishing, while her daughters are in school and are also working in the same business as her.  They live in their own home made from adobe, with a corrugated iron roof and cement floor.  They have electricity, but no potable water or sewer connection in their home, because the basic services aren't available in the area.  <br \/><br \/>Her business is making woven fabrics such as the \"aguayo\", which is woven by hand and is worn by the women of Altiplano.  Each woman has her own aguayo, which are made with llama, sheep, or alpaca wool and is dyed with bright colors.  She comments that \"with the help of my daughters, we want to weave greater quantities in order to sell them in other towns...\".  Her business is successful because wearing these garments is almost obligatory for the customs and traditions.  The advantage of her business is that she has her daughters' help with weaving, the disadvantage is that she lacks a loom in order to produce a greater quantity. Her dream is to increase her production in order to sell at fairs in neighboring towns.  <br \/><br \/>She would like to buy an artisanal loom and sheeps' wool.  This is her first loan cycle with the institution in the 16 years she has been doing this work.

Still, her family members are not happy due to the non-availability of a good RCC house that they own.<br \/><br \/>They are staying at a rented house with a high rate of rent and without sufficient facilities. It is very difficult to leave during the rainy season. It is also very critical to stay during the summer and winter season. In this situation, she decided to construct a house with a good standard.

They are especially proud of their roots. The place where they live is wonderful as it is tranquil and preserves the important traditions. The majority of the population celebrates religious festivals with dances, music, and parades.<br \/><br \/>Sra. Rosa is one of the most friendly members. She is always in a very good humour and goes about her work with the goal of watching over the wellbeing of her family. Her family consists of her husband Pedro, who is a businessman, and their four children, three of whom are currently at school. Her eldest daughter is studying to be a seamstress, another is at college, and the youngest in secondary school.<br \/><br \/>At the same time as starting her family, Rosa and her husband began their business selling shoes. However, some time later, they put their efforts into raising animals, believing it gave them better opportunities for development. So, twenty years later, they pay for household expenses and the education of their children from this work. The animals are bought when they are very small so they can control the healthy development of each one. Rosa explains that they buy the animals at the market and return there to sell them when they are sure of obtaining a good profit.<br \/><br \/>One of the difficulties they face is when the animals get sick. However, they have set aside money to cover such events.

With Babban Gona\u2019s support, Maryam will store the maize she harvests and delay it\u2019s sale until a date later in the season when she can obtain a significantly higher price for her maize at a premium up to 37% more than the harvest price.<br \/> <br \/>With the opportunity to earn up to $2,000 per hectare of land, Maryam now has the opportunity to actualize her dream to grow her agriculture business for herself and family members and would like to use this additional income to ensure that all her children get a post secondary education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2043937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to eliminate the pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-12-07T16:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-06T16:20:05Z","loan_amount":100,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maryam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":15412.17,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":15412.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-08T01:51:19Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Etchison","image":null}},{"id":990176,"name":"Shakila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shakila  is a 31-year-old married woman.

The smell of burned sugarcane is in the air and the whole community is in motion by 5 in the morning to carry out its activities.  The sugar harvest is a part of the community identity, and so the residents consider themselves privileged to come from a sugar region.  The Los Globos group, whose name refers to a local business, was formed In a place surrounded by sugarcane plants and pastureland.  The members are: Graciela, who sells tacos and local food, Adriana and Marilu, footwear from catalogs, Odulia, meat, Natalia, taxi service, Dulce and Juan, clothing, Azucena, groceries and food, Nieves M., cosmetics, Nieves B., home goods, and Carolina, lingerie.  \r\n\r\nGraciela, known to everyone as \"Chela\", has a friendly character and shares with any person that she knows.  She belongs to a family of merchants.  Her uncles made a living at a bakery and her mother sold local food in the community for more than 30 years.  Following the family example, she started selling local food.  In the beginning she only wanted to make an investment of her free time, but later, as the demand from her customers increased, she went from selling out of her kitchen to establishing a business outside of her home.  \"I started it for fun and now it's my biggest accomplishment,\" she happily comments.  Also, the profits allowed her to build a sheet metal roof to protect herself from the sun and occasionally the rain.  \r\n\r\nOne thing that gives her a lot of joy is being able to provide employment for three people who help her, mostly with the preparation of lunches for students from a nearby primary school.  She also makes tacos from various ingredients on the weekend and her children help her deliver the orders to homes.  \"What I like the most is the fellowship with my customers, to see them happy while they enjoy my food,\" says Chela, who attributes the success of her business to her distinct seasoning and customer service.  \r\n\r\nThe loan will allow her to buy meat, tortillas, vegetables, chiles, plates, and soft drinks, since her sales go up with the beginning of the sugar harvest season.\r\n\r\n*This photo was taken outside of Azucena's store.

Las ganancias obtenidas le han permitido comenzar una nueva actividad junto con su esposo, adem\u00e1s de realizar remodelaciones a su hogar.\n   Para Juana lo m\u00e1s importante de sus actividades es el trato con las personas pues le satisface y alienta saber que dej\u00f3 satisfecho a un cliente. Para lograrlo ha solicitado un nuevo pr\u00e9stamo para comprar anillos, aretes, pulseras, tintes, per\u00f3xido, spray, pasadores y peines para invertir en ambas actividades. Finalmente comenta, \u201cestoy feliz por la gran familia que tengo y por conocer a gente que conf\u00eda en nosotros, Dios los bendiga\u201d.\n\n*La fotograf\u00eda fue tomada en un antiguo pozo, Do\u00f1a Juana es quien viste blusa color rosa y falda blanca, su peque\u00f1o hijo est\u00e1 junto a ella.\n","en":"Only 20 minutes from \"La Novia del Sol\" (\"the Bride of the Sun\"), among sugarcane plants and mango trees, you can find a community where you can still appreciate the roots of the Mazatec culture.  Most of the older adults speak some variety of the language originating from the area now known as Veracruz. \r\nA group called Manantial, whose name identifies their place of origin, formed in this community.  The members are: Juana, who sells silver items and styles hair, Anai, chicken, Georgina, cosmetics, Sebasti\u00e1n, sugarcane, Eva, clothing, Rosa, stationary and photos, and Rubicela with Gabriela, local food.  \r\n\r\nJuana is a very charismatic and centered woman.  \"The economic necessity and desire to provide the best for my family motivated me to start my business,\" she says.  She has been making a living selling silver items on foot for eight years.  She also provides hair styling services in people's homes since, as she puts it, \"I like everything related to beauty.\"  This allows her to combine her business activities, since after doing a cut or a brushing, she offers her silver items.  In order to achieve the success that she has had as a stylist, she went to beauty school, and her friendliness also made her customers want to recommend her to more people.  The profits that she has gained have allowed her to start a new business with her husband and remodel her home.  \r\n\r\nFor Juana, the most important thing in her business is customer service, since it nourishes and satisfies her to leave her customers satisfied.  She has requested a new loan to buy rings, earrings, bracelets, dyes, peroxide, hairspray, clips, and combs to invest in both of her businesses.  Finally, she comments, \"I am happy for the big family that I have and to know people who believe in us.  God bless you.\"\r\n\r\n*This photo was taken in an old well.  Juana is wearing a pink shirt and a white skirt, with her little son by her side.
