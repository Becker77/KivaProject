Those things have brought her to the point where today she has a proper kitchen where she makes delicious cakes that are much in-demand in her community.  Her success has been notable, above all because hers is main bakery to provide cakes for the weddings, baptisms, and birthdays of the residents.  \r\n \r\nTo continue her growth, she will use the loan to buy sprinkles, cake trays, plates, paint,  gel, eggs, milk, sugar, jam, butter, and flour.

She went into this field because she likes everything that has to do with computer science. She also has an uncle who works in this field, which sparked an interest in her. She also would like to innovate or create something new that could benefit many people. <br \/><br \/>She is doing very well in school. She has six months left to go to complete her studies and earn her professional degree. When she finishes, she would like to work for a company and gain lots of practical experience in order to achieve her dream one day, which is to start her own company. This would allow her to help her family, particularly her father, who is in delicate health. Another of Lizbeth's dreams is to be able to help homeless children and elderly people who live on the street.<br \/><br \/>The main hurdle that Lizbeth faces is that her parents are separated. She and her brother lived apart until four years ago, when they started living together again. She was living with her aunts, who didn't treat her very well because her father didn't help support her, but his illness prevented him from working and still does now. For this reason, it is still possible that Lisbeth might have to drop out from school even now that she is so close to finishing. <br \/><br \/>Because of everything that is going on, Lizbeth has come to KIVA for support, so that she can finish what she was so happy to start. She will use her loan to cover her monthly payments. Her grandparents won't have to worry so much and, without having to worry about finances, she will be even more motivated to work hard in order to get ahead.<br \/><br \/>Lizbeth would like to say a few words: \"I am very happy and grateful for the support you are giving me, especially because my grandparents won't have to worry so much about money. Your help motivates me to get ahead by letting me know that there are people out there who support young people like me in spite of the financial problems we may have. I won't give up and I will work hard to achieve my goals. God bless each and every one of you.

To alleviate this situation, a good solution is to install a satellite dish, which provides a coded signal to be reproduced on the TV. \"Most of the rural areas and neighborhoods located far from the city center do not have access to cable television. I offer them an alternative solution to stay on par with the rest of the population...\" he says. \r\n\r\nHis business is a success thanks to the fact that his customers live in rural and distant areas without access to television. The advantage of his business is that he takes care of sales and installation; the disadvantage is the lack of antennas and decoders to provide the service. \r\n\r\nHis dream is to expand his sales in rural areas. He wants to buy antennas and decoders so he can set up satellite television connections in the country. \r\n\r\nThis is his first loan sequence with our institution in three years of operating this business. It is for these reasons that Ever is requesting a loan to buy antennas and decoders to connect satellite television in the country.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2043023,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy antennas and decoders so he can set up satellite television connections in the country.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.5 -68.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2015-12-07T23:20:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-06T23:20:01Z","loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[{"name":"#Parent"},{"name":"#Technology"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ever Windsor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":39.52},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.32},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.92},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.99},{"due_date":"2016-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":67.01},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.46},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.81},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.41},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.53},{"due_date":"2016-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":82.63},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.19},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.62},{"due_date":"2017-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":92.77},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.51},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.82},{"due_date":"2017-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":105.48},{"due_date":"2017-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":111.14},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.52},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.32},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.92},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.99},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.01},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.46},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.81},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.41},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.53},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.63},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.19},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.62},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.77},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.51},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.82},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.48},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.14},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Pabst","image":1669945}},{"id":989719,"name":"Mirian Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mirian, solicita un nuevo cr\u00e9dito para poderlo invertir en la compra de productos comestibles, como cereales, agua, golosinas, granos b\u00e1sicos, etc., para surtir su mini tienda, en vista que se aproxima una buena temporada en la que considera podr\u00e1 obtener buenos ingresos.\nElla comenta que con el cr\u00e9dito anterior pudo incrementar su inventario y esto le permiti\u00f3 generar buenas ganancias pagar las deudas y suplir los gastos del hogar.

Considering the present-day financial status of his family and the overall crisis encountered by his home country Tajikistan, supplemented by the recent drastic cutoff of the migrants\u2019 remittances, the financial aid is the only opportunity available for him to continue his studies at AUCA - one of the most reputable educational institutions in Central Asia.<br \/><br \/>Asliddin came to study at AUCA from Tajikistan, where he has a father, a mother, younger sister and younger brother. His father is an accountant and his mother is a school-teacher. His younger brother studies at one of the universities of Russia on a budgetary basis. However he has to pay for his accommodations and live by himself. He has to have a part-time job, as the education cost in Russia is much higher than in Tajikistan. Asliddin\u2019s younger sister is also a student at the local university in his home town and his parents totally cover her tuition. Asliddin\u2019s parents\u2019 income is about 200 USD per month, which covers subsistence expenditures. <br \/><br \/>Kiva's loan will be a great help for him and his family to raise the next well-educated person in his family.

He chose to enroll in this university not only because it is one of the best universities in Central Asia, but also because his elder sibling studies there as a sophomore (giving him firsthand insight into the life and the quality of education). To become a freshman, Samat had to take extra English classes and improve his math knowledge, as AUCA selects only the best and most diligent students.<br \/><br \/>Samat\u2019s family lives in the neighboring country of Kazakhstan. There are 3 other people in his family: his father, mother, and elder brother, who also studies at AUCA. At present, Samat\u2019s mother is unemployed. His father doesn\u2019t have a permanent job, so he does everything he can to earn money and support his family. Thanks to diligence, last year, Samat\u2019s brother was blessed to get the donor\u2019s full scholarship to study at AUCA, decreasing the financial expenses of his family.  Of course, Samat\u2019s parents are happy to see their sons enroll in the best university, where they will be well-educated and will have a better life than their parents.  However, the current economic and political situation in their country doesn't warm their attitude. After joining the Customs Union of the Eurasian Economic Community, Kazakhstan has faced some economic problems.<br \/><br \/>In spite all of these circumstances, Samat hopes that Kiva lenders will support him and change his life for the better. Samat believes that AUCA is the right place for future leaders, as it helps students build leadership skills and prepare for modern life. <br \/><br \/>Through three years of collaboration between AUCA and Kiva, Kiva lenders have assisted more than 330 students in getting their bachelor degrees and have made a great impact in raising the future champions of democracy in Kyrgyzstan."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2045244,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Higher Education"],"use":"to pay for his higher education.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Taraz, Kazakhstan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":326,"posted_date":"2015-12-08T18:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-07T18:20:05Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Schooling"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2016-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":67,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2019-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2019-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2020-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2021-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Walker Fuller","image":null}},{"id":990697,"name":"Gina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gina is 30 years old and married with four children.

The past loans have helped her better support her family members. Now she is seeking for a loan to buy seeds and pesticides for supporting her cassava and use some of it to spend on plowing the field for growing. With this loan, she hopes to grow her cassava fruitfully and healthily and also hopes to make more income to improve her standard of living and keep her children in school."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2043789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy seeds and pesticides for supporting her cassava","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Kampong Cham province, Dambae district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2015-12-08T18:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-07T18:30:05Z","loan_amount":700,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sreyneang ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":2700000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1350000},{"due_date":"2016-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1350000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":990738,"name":"Boony","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Boony has five children, three of whom attend school.
