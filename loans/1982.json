","en":"Nurbubu is a 48-year-old widow and the mother of four children.  For the past 20 years, she has been involved in agriculture and animal husbandry, two activities which constitute her family's main source of income.  Thanks to her very hard work, she currently has three cows, 31 sheep and two horses on her farm.  She also grows barley and alfalfa on 1.2 hectares of leased land and 1.65 hectares of her own land.  She makes up to 35,000 som (KGS) every month from her combined activities.  Having realized that her farming business could be profitable, she has turned to Kiva's partner, Bai Tushum Bank, and requested a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) to buy six steers for fattening and resale.  She is planning to use the earnings from her loan to further expand her farming business and to improve her family's material well-being."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2035654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy six steers for fattening and resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Naryn district","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2015-12-09T03:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-08T03:20:03Z","loan_amount":2000,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"#Animals"},{"name":"#Parent"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nurbubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":2000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6150},{"due_date":"2015-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4602},{"due_date":"2016-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4735},{"due_date":"2016-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":4871},{"due_date":"2016-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5011},{"due_date":"2016-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5155},{"due_date":"2016-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5303},{"due_date":"2016-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5456},{"due_date":"2016-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5612},{"due_date":"2016-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5774},{"due_date":"2016-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5940},{"due_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":6111},{"due_date":"2016-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6286},{"due_date":"2016-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6467},{"due_date":"2017-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6653},{"due_date":"2017-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":6844},{"due_date":"2017-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7041},{"due_date":"2017-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7243},{"due_date":"2017-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7452},{"due_date":"2017-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7666},{"due_date":"2017-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":7886},{"due_date":"2017-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8113},{"due_date":"2017-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":8346},{"due_date":"2017-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":5283}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.36},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.13},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.95},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.81},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.73},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.71},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.75},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.83},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.99},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.2},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.48},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.81},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.23},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":88.71},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.25},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.88},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.57},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.36},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.21},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.15},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.17},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.28},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":990877,"name":"Asia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asia is 32 and lives in the area of Rawalpindi, Pakistan.

Her husband recently died and she now lives with her elderly mother and her youngest children in a traditional hut that is not well ventilated nor warms up well in winter. Neither she nor her eldest children work proper jobs and hence earn very little.\r\n\r\nShe works long hours on her farm with 1 of her children, the other one is employed on other peoples' farms, and the youngest at 13 is still going to school during the week and helping in the field on Saturdays and Sundays. Together with her eldest child, Mamohau has to wake up very early between 4am and 5am during the week, to start preparing the fire for cooking breakfast, heating water, and warming the house for her family before going out to attend to daily work because she can not afford any other means. \r\n\r\nHowever, with little money she makes while working, plus her mother's pension money which is not much, and the little money that the other child makes, she is now able to afford to buy gas and paraffin which are both very expensive. She finds herself having to pay about R500 to R600 a month to have sufficient gas, paraffin, and groceries which include candles for lighting and charcoal for her traditional home made heater; this is money she hardly makes. Not only is gas expensive for Mamohau and many like her, but it is highly flammable and when inhaled can lead to lung diseases and even death. Candles have proven to cause a lot of fire accidents, even deaths, because they are often forgotten and not blown out which is dangerous. The the traditional heater is bad for Momohau's family of young children and Mamohau's elderly mother. \r\n\r\nMamohau has requested a loan from Kiva lenders in order to be able to purchase clean cook stoves for her and 11 other people from her village who are living in similar circumstances.  This means the chance of cooking in a way that does not harm them and their families.  The stoves do not require a lot of wood which is hard to find in Lesotho, nor expensive paraffin and gas. This stove can be started with the use of very little, readily available biomass like dry twigs and dry cow dung that do not require lengths of time to collect. It does not produce smoke while burning, thus making it safe to be used inside the home. This stove comes with a solar panel for charging the battery which runs the fan in the stove, a USB port for charging phones, and a mini LED lamp. A life improving package for these people.\r\n\r\nThis stove saves them time to be with their family, saves energy, eliminates toxic inhalation, house burning, and has given them the freedom to have a better lit home to see better in the evening while cooking and enables children to do their homework.

With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to send her children to school.<br \/><br \/>With this loan, Rabecca\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 6.25 acres of land and purchase a total of 12 solar lights."}},"status":"funded","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2037630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation\t\t\t\t.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Teso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-12-09T10:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-08T10:10:02Z","loan_amount":925,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rabecca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charles","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice A","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Obed","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victor O","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lydia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joyce","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Franciscah I","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evans O","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose A","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis E","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aggrey P","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica A","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Donarld A","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":94400,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-09T15:15:29Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":988312,"name":"Akmal","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0410\u043a\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u041a\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0434\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0430. \u0415\u043c\u0443 29 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u043d \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0445 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c. \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0444\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c. \u041e\u0442 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0430 \u0410\u043a\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0438 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0435. \u041d\u043e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043e\u0441\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u044d\u0442\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0410\u043a\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0443  \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c, \u0444\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441. \u0421 \u044d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0438\u043c \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043e\u043d \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435.

Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 750 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. <br \/><br \/>Victorious Mixed Day & Boarding School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

This is Richard. He is the Head Teacher of St. Michael High School, a mixed school in the urban area of Sonde in Mukono with 700 students. St. Michael School has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 1000 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nSt. Michael School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Richard ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2045776,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Education provider","sector":"Education","themes":["Innovative Loans"],"use":"to purchase a water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mukono","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.25 32.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":329,"posted_date":"2015-12-09T15:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-08T15:20:04Z","loan_amount":1850,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[{"name":"user_favorite"},{"name":"#Eco-friendly"},{"name":"#Schooling"},{"name":"#HealthAndSanitation"},{"name":"#IncomeProducingDurableAsset"}],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"St. Michael High School","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":6088000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1217600},{"due_date":"2016-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1217600},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1217600},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1217600},{"due_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1217600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":370}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-10T21:11:27Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tim Gibson","image":1632475}},{"id":991057,"name":"Manasseh","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manasseh is a maize farmer from Gidan Samaila village.
