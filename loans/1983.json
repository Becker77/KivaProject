Hajara is thankful that she now has the opportunity to improve the life of her children and family and looks forward to using her additional earnings to ensure that all her children get a post secondary education."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":50,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":2046163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Purchases","sector":"Personal Use","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy food and clothing, eliminating pressure to sell maize for low prices at harvest","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NG","country":"Nigeria","town":"Kaduna","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":288,"posted_date":"2015-12-09T19:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-08T19:40:05Z","loan_amount":50,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hajara ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NGN","disbursal_amount":6890.92,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":50,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":6890.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2015-12-09T20:14:25Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":991255,"name":"Warna Sari Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Warna Sari Group has received loans from MUK and can be paid well.

And, as a result she will generate a larger income that will help her give a better quality of life to her children.\r\n\r\nOlinda\u2019s dream is to be able to reach a more stable life for her family and to expand her business and give her children higher education. \r\n"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2044377,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy chicken, vegetables, sugar, plates, utensils, firewood, propane gas, etc. This will help her take advantage of the Christmas season.\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":167,"posted_date":"2015-12-10T01:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-09T01:30:06Z","loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olinda Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1025,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":29.91},{"due_date":"2016-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":28.8},{"due_date":"2016-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":31.69},{"due_date":"2016-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":33.61},{"due_date":"2016-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2016-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":35.53},{"due_date":"2016-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":34.88},{"due_date":"2016-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":35.98},{"due_date":"2016-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":37.88},{"due_date":"2016-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":38.3},{"due_date":"2016-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":40.2},{"due_date":"2016-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":40.77},{"due_date":"2016-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":42.66},{"due_date":"2017-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":43.39},{"due_date":"2017-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":44.75},{"due_date":"2017-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":47.6},{"due_date":"2017-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":47.66},{"due_date":"2017-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2017-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50.71},{"due_date":"2017-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":52.59},{"due_date":"2017-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":53.96},{"due_date":"2017-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":55.48},{"due_date":"2017-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":57.63},{"due_date":"2017-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":59.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.91},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.8},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.69},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.61},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.85},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.53},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.88},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.98},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.88},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.3},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.2},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.77},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.66},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.39},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.75},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.6},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.66},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.54},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.71},{"due_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.59},{"due_date":"2017-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.96},{"due_date":"2017-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.48},{"due_date":"2017-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.63},{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Leah Sakr Lavender","image":1326256}},{"id":991371,"name":"Touch's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Touch, 42, is a married woman who is blessed with four children, three of whom are dependent on her and still in school.

A fundamental part of starting this business was the unfortunate illness of her mother which meant the business had to allow Horte to care for her and earn a good living at the same time.  Therefore, with a small awning and a table outside her home she started selling sweets.  Fortunately the business took off and some time later she was able to build a shop where she displays her products.<br \/><br \/>Even though she faces competition Horte knows that through excellent customer service, low prices and a wide variety of goods she can attract more customers.  She will use this loan to buy canned goods, soft drinks, milk and sugar which are the most popular products.  \"Very important holidays are near and I hope to increase my profits to expand my store.

In the workshop the family can be seen everyday creating figurines based on molds brought from the capital. They make elephants, owls, crosses, and pencil holders, just to mention a few pieces. Once the merchandise is ready, Gregorio and his children travel to different parts of the republic to offer their handmade crafts and they come back only when they finish selling all of the figurines.

Its a very tranquil community, characterized by its enormous dam, which is so big it can irrigate all the nearby corn fields, and it also provides fishing for some neighbors in the community.<br \/><br \/>Olidia is a very happy person, a worker with grand entrepreneurial spirit, always very preoccupied for her family's wellbeing. She is 29 years old and has been married to Victor for many years. Together they formed a family with five children; four of whom are studying, and three are sponsored by World Vision.<br \/><br \/>Since Olidia married Victor, she decided to help with household expenses because her Mother always advised her to start a business, raising and fattening sheep plus creating embroidery. This was a very good option because she would not have to leave home and could continue caring for her children, while at the same time helping cover household expenses. <br \/><br \/>Olidia buys her little lambs in the same community. She always tries to get them very young, then raise them and sell them to her neighbors, or taking advantage of some type of festival, she offers them to those who sponsor the fiesta. Olidia comments that she keeps the lambs at home between the age of eight months and a year, then she sells them for a good profit. She doesn't have to spend money to feed them since she takes advantage of the countryside. Very early, she takes them out to graze in the country. \"Now that the dry period has arrived, it is much easier because with the cultivation of corn, they are harvesting and cutting down the plants and there remains lots of stalks and this is what we take advantage of for the animals,\" Olidia comments very contentedly.<br \/><br \/>She is very pleased and grateful for VFMexico and Kiva, because for more than a year, she has requested loans that have helped her expand her business. With her earnings, she can cover her children's educational expenses and help build her house.

Olidia always cares for her little lambs very well, so that they will grow and develop and, thus, she can obtain good earnings.<br \/><br \/>The members of the group include Teresa, who invests in young bulls; Victoria, Carolina and Hilaria, who invest in bread; and Ma Marcela, who invest in clothing.<br \/><br \/>*The photograph was taken in the municipality's Garden of the Arches.

In spite of the difficulties they both suffer, they are confident that their effort, courage, and especially the love they show each other, will enable them to overcome every obstacle that comes their way.<br \/><br \/>They had their first child 10 months ago, after which home ownership became their main priority.<br \/><br \/>Ivan is studying upper secondary education (high school) and hopes in the not too distant future to have a professional career that will provide him more opportunities.<br \/><br \/>Both have support from their families and are sure that they will achieve their goals, as their limitations are not an impediment to live as God wills. <br \/><br \/>For now Maricela, in addition to her income from pensions, sells beauty products because she believes that having an extra income is needed to build her home as she has dreamed.
