For more than 54 years he has worked in the fields.  When he was young he would go to the nearby mountains to cut coffee.  It was there that he met Brigida, who is now his wife, and with whom he has lived for more than 40 years.  Ten years after meeting, they were able to acquire a small plot of land, which was gifted to them by relatives.  Twenty nine years ago they decided to build a house of strips and fronds of palm.  Since then they have had to adapt to the conditions brought about by this house.  At the beginning they lived very well, but with the passage of time they began to have many problems due to moths.  In addition, in the rainy season the entire interior of the house gets wet.<br \/><br \/>Fernando and Brigida had three girls, but all three married and went to live elsewhere.  As fate would have it, one of them had problems with her husband, and had to leave him while she was pregnant.  From that situation, Fernando and Brigida welcomed her into their house, and it was there, in the house of palm, that their grandson Jos\u00e9 Armando was born.   Later their daughter left to work elsewhere and reunited with the father of her child three years later.  Both parents, seeing the love and the manner in which Fernando and Brigida treated Jos\u00e9 Armando, decided to leave him with his grandparents for good.  Today Jos\u00e9 Armando continues living with his grandparents who love him like parents.  He goes almost every day to see his parents since they live in the same community.  Jos\u00e9 Armando wants to be a doctor when he grows up, and his grandparents confirm that this will be so, as they wish to offer him everything to realize his dream.   <br \/><br \/>Since they have lived in this community, Fernando and Brigida consider themselves blessed as they enjoy much tranquility and abundant water.  They have never had problems except for the terrible conditions in which they live in the current house of palm.  In their free time they go to walk through the fields and enjoy food that they heat over an open air fire.  <br \/><br \/>They receive help from their other daughters and believe that they will never fall behind on the loan that Kiva can provide them."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2045937,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

Cuastecomatillo is her husband Rigoberto's hometown and their two children were born there.  Given that Rigoberto's family members are common land holders, Elvira and him have made a living solely from Agriculture, mainly in the planting and harvesting of beans.  Ten years ago they acquired the land that they live in and, since they have always striven to have their own home, they decide to build a room with wooden boards and galvanized sheets.  \r\n\r\nElvira and her family enjoy where they live very much given that it is a very quiet place with extraordinary riches due to the water that flows from a nearby spring.  They consider that the only bad thing there is the lack of work during rainy season given that they cannot plant any product.  In addition they don't have public services such as telephone and internet nor junior high schools.  Their children are now studying in a school that is 30 minutes away from their home.  Everyday they go to school and when they return, Rigoberto helps his father with work in the fields and Itza helps her mother with house chores.  The main problem that they consider has affected them so far is the lack of a proper home as they are currently exposed to poisonous snakes, scorpions and spiders.  A proper home will bring them security, improved health and peacefulness above all.  \r\n\r\nRigoberto, junior would like to study to become a veterinarian and Itza would like to become a nurse.  They all struggle every day to make this a reality as they understand this would be the best for all of them.  Finally, Elvira shares that they live a very happy life and she considers that she has a very united family.  For them, the country allows them to live together day by day.  \r\n\r\nElvira's favorite  moment is to go and eat under the shadow of a tree and enjoy the wonderful smells that nature brings along,  Elvira's dream is that her family can live in a proper home where each can have its own space, where the walls are not built out of fragile wood boards and where the roof is not made out of sheet.  A place built with strong foundations like the ones she would like her children to build for their lives."}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":25,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2045986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She buys grocery supplies and clothes at wholesale prices and sells by the piece. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand her business, she is seeking a PHP 50,000 loan to fill her small store with essential food items such as bread, biscuits, canned good, instant noodles, eggs, oil, and toiletries. Part of the loan she will use to buy several ready to wear clothes to sell in their community, especially with Christmas just around the corner. She expects a higher demand of grocery items and Ready-To-Wear.\r\n\r\nPerla wishes to grow her store and have her own slot at the town's market.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term because the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a Tulip Filtration water treatment system with 5 Sets of 20 liter buckets which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \r\n\r\nKiwalazi P.

Since joining One Acre Fund in 2013, Linet has noticed that she has had a healthier life due to better nutrition.\r\n\r\nLinet described her harvest as good last year, but believes she can have a better one this year by continuing to work with One Acre Fund. She is very excited to also be purchasing a solar light, apart from fertilizer and maize, because she will now be able to reduce the consumption of paraffin fuel and therefore save more money. With the profits from this season\u2019s harvest, she plans to buy a cow.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Linet\u2019s Group will be able to plant a total of 5 acres of land and purchase a total of 7 solar lights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"}},"status":"fundraising","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":0,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2033067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to purchase a solar light and gain access to cost efficient hybrid seeds and fertilizer for maize cultivation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2015-12-11T14:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2016-01-10T14:30:03Z","loan_amount":650,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Linet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annety","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fridah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Douglas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Metrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":65125,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sandi Chamberlain","image":202541}},{"id":991826,"name":"Ali","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ali makes pickled vegetables.
