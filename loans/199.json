She is 42 years old. Pacita is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Pacita owns and operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products such as milo, nestea juice, coffeemate, coffee, shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. Pacita has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Pacita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Pacita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Pacita is requesting a new loan of 3000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Pacita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She retails the products at the great market in Bougouni, for cash or credit, to a clientele mostly made up of women.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, Adiara expects to make an average profit of 17,500 CFA francs a month.

This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas, known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy), with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provide services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices, and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":35714,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Farm rice and invest in pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-18T00:44:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ernesto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-04T05:50:17Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-12T22:22:06Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31429},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:20:18Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40403},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T19:48:03Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53269},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-29T23:17:40Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73628},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T00:33:39Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":88531},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T17:42:26Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:22:53Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99027}],"funded_date":"2007-05-21T05:50:17Z","paid_date":"2007-12-18T17:42:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14160,"name":"Thuy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Thuy S. and her husband are farmers in Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia.

Zebi Amonovna is selling children's clothing for the past 16 years. She is married and has five children. After the collapse of the Soviet Union (USSR) she and her husband lost their jobs. Her husband is currently unemployed. Zebi had to start selling on the market to feed her family. Her older son was also helping her. As her children grew older her income was not enough. Her older son had to go to Russia to find work. He was sending home US$100 a month, but it was still not enough. In the early 2006 Zebi obtained a loan to expand her business. She started buying merchandise in large quantities (wholesale) for a lower price and selling it retail or semi-wholesale. Her younger son, Zubaidullo is helping her with the business. Zebi wants to be more competitive and intends to travel to Bishkek, the Republic of Kyrgyztan, herself to purchase merchandise which will allow her to start selling wholesale.\r\n<p> <b>Translated

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is starting a business venture,  which is flower garden.  Metuli needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchse additional garden equipments.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Metuli joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Metuli's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Metuli Maliota are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Today, he transports people throughout his town and the surrounding local area. He previously operated between his province and the surrounding cities. However, a bus service was installed, which cut into his profits. This caused him to make the change to becoming a local driver. Bayrmagnai is a well experienced driver and has good communication skills. His business is very important to him because it is the only source of income for his family. Bayrmagnai is focused on the future and says, \"I would like to stabilize my business and will work hard to pay back my loan in full.\" He is requesting a 1,500,000 tugrug (~ 1,100 USD) loan to

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255705,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is a very resourceful mother whose hard work brings a livelihood to the family. Comfort supports herself through the sale of used clothing and bed sheets. Selling of used clothing and bed sheets has a very big market share in Ghana, as brand new clothes are very expensive for the economically active poor. She has been in this business for the past 30 years. She travels to a nearby city called Accra to purchase her stock of goods. She wants to use the loan to buy more bales of used clothing to increase her inventory. She normally concentrates on kid\u2019s wear, bed sheets and used towel sales.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":369386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more common household goods for reselling.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-08-14T16:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Huruma E.

He is married and he is the father of 3 children, still in his care. He has become the best autobody specialist because he has been in this occupation since 1994. Therefore as an experienced veteran in the field he opened his shop, located in the district of Ablogame in the city of Lome. He has many loyal customers that appreciate the work well-done. He also has a number of apprenticeships, given that many parents want their children to become like him. He currently requires a new painting tool, which is why he is requesting a loan from Wages (Kiva Field Partner). The loan will also be used to expand and improve his general auto mechanic workshop.

He is 38 years old, married and the father of 3 children, who are 8, 5, and 3 years old.  His oldest child attends school.  Armando went to school up until his 3rd year of the Industrial Institute, but stopped his studies because he had to work in order to support his family.  He lives in his own home and is not financially responsible for anyone except his immediate family.  He left Chimoio for Boane in 1999 when he was transferred with the [military] service.  A short time after that he built his own home where he still lives with his family. He is an employee of Mozambique Electricity company where he works as an electrician.  He has worked there for 8 years, for 8 hours a day from Monday through Friday.  He learned how to do this work in Chimoio in 1998.  His monthly salary is 7.465,00mt and he is able to save a little each month.  He has never had a loan with any other financial institution and this is his first loan with Hluvuku, for 15.000,00mt.  He will use the money to buy sand, cement, steel, rocks and other building materials to finish his project.  He heard about Hluvuku because he lives next to the Boane branch.  He is committed to paying his loan off on-time in order to qualify for other loans to furnish his home and to open a business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Rachel Crouch, Kiva

She doesn\u2019t pay rent for business premises because she sells from her home. She works in a semi urban area which is in the outskirts of Kampala. She works seven days a week. She receives an average of thirty customers a day and sells to all categories of people both on retail and wholesale. Her greatest monthly expenses include feeding the family and school fees for her children. Her major business challenges are transportation and seasonality. She has been in this business for six years and with MCDT for ten years servicing her twentieth loan, working with the same group mates. Resty joined MCDT because it was near her home and was working with poor women. She wants to use this loan to buy more sacks of charcoal for use during the festive season. She aspires to see her business grower bigger and starts selling on wholesale only and also going directly to

She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her rug-making business.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for an 8,000 PHP loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying supplies needed to continue production of her rugs, like fabric, thread and so on.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow. She hopes to have more patrons and loyal customers\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Together they live in a modest house in a quiet zone of the central sierra of Peru. She works in agriculture because she says it is what she knows how to do best. She learned how to do it by observing her relatives and neighbors in the community. Currently she works together with her husband growing potatoes, peas and corn. Although the farming work is self-sacrificing because you have to get up early every day to care for the crops in order to ensure a good production, she says that during the harvest she gets her reward. Since the better you care for your crops the better the products they will produce. Because her natural products are good quality, she has regular customers in the largest market in the city and from the sales she gets regular profits, which allows her to give her family an appropriate quality of life. For the future she plans to plant larger plots of land. She also wants to buy some heads of cattle to raise and have for whatever difficulty that may arise. This is her third loan with MFP and she is very thankful to all the people who made the loan possible as it will allow her to continue working in search of progress. Also, she says that she is satisfied with the performance of her communal group because all the members are very responsible with making their payments. Yolanda plans to invest the requested loan in buying bags of various fertilizers that she needs to improve the productivity of her crops.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Fanning, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":586239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy bags of fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-19T21:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1539.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463119}],"funded_date":"2010-08-20T00:58:34Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Fanning","image":null}},{"id":228075,"name":"Jenifer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jenifer N. is 20 years old and lives in the town of Kasubi, in the Kampala region of Uganda.

Saijalol is a very happy and sociable 56-year-old man. He says he is a happily married man with a hard-working woman who has supported him in achieving all of his dreams. They have ten children and they would have liked to have more. Saijalol\u2019s family is one that loves working in agriculture. The whole family works together to harvest different vegetables. It has been six years since Saijalol began working the land he loves so much. His wife sells the products in the local market. Saijalol also earns some extra income by breeding cattle.\r\n\r\nSaijalol is requesting a loan to acquire agricultural supplies that are necessary to maintain the crops. With part of the loan he will also buy young cattle.  His dream is that his children inherit the love to work the land that he and his wife acquired with great effort, and that some day their children will inherit.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In most cases, she purchases the fish she sells from fishermen who bring their catch to Lugazi town.\r\n\r\nHer biggest challenge has been the fact that she has to sell her fish while moving. This, she says, has stifled the growth of her business as some of her clients are not easily accessible. She has to spend money every day to reach some of them and some of these clients reside in far off places. This, needless to say, has played havoc with the consolidation of her finances.\r\n\r\nShe says this business's gross profits total up to UGX 50,000 weekly.\r\n\r\nSarah says this Kiva loan is to help her construct a permanent stall from which she can sell her fish."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":816375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To construct a permanent fishing-selling stall.

children.  Since 1991, she has been involved in animal husbandry and agriculture, two activities which constitute her family's main source of income.  She started in this business with 10,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her very hard work, she has come to the point where she has six cows and 10 sheep on her farm.  She also grows alfalfa on one hectare of land.  She makes a monthly income of 5,000 som (KGS), which is not enough for a decent life.  For this reason, and in order to further grow her business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC and requested a loan of 150,000 som (KGS) to buy two bulls.  She is planning to use the earnings from her loan to further develop her business and to improve her family's well-being."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1830809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Vulnerable Groups"],"use":"to buy two bulls in order to increase her income.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Kazarman village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zuurakan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":587.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":587.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sophie Narayan","image":1284174}},{"id":978775,"name":"Unidas Con Esperanza 1 & 2 Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Grimilda is one of the members of Unidas con Esperanza (Unite with Esperanza) 1 & 2.

In many parts of this area, running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long-term partner and her three children.\r\n\r\nTomasina is excited to be taking her tenth loan with Esperanza, after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business to buy rice, flour, other foods, and a freezer. Her business is a colmado, a place where you can find all the ingredients and products to make your daily meals. Normally colmados are in local neighborhoods so that customers have a short distance to walk from their homes. She will use the profits to pay for her children's expenses at the university, to buy a vehicle, and also to finish building her house so that she has a safer home for her family. She thanks you all for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3400,"image":{"id":562038,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

She is 50 years old. Leonora is widowed and has 8 children. To make a living, Leonora owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale. Leonora has been engaged in her business for over 25 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Leonora joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Leonora is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Leonora from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He was employed as an assistant on a truck that delivered goods from store to store.  Her son acted upon the urge to become an entrepreneur, so he decided to involve his mother in the business and now Ana sells from her home.  Her future goal is to remodel a bedroom facing the street and convert it into a storage space.  At that point, she plans to hire vendors to handle the distribution.  However, her greatest challenge is still a lack of sufficient capital.

M. is a 43-year-old man, who is a practicing doctor. He is married and has three adult children. He lives in Kayole, an informal settlement within Nairobi, where he also runs his medical clinic. Apart from his family, he takes care of two children orphaned by HIV\/AIDS.<P>\r\n\r\nDr. M. began a clinic back in his rural home in 1996 using some of his own savings amounting to about Ksh. 70,000 (USD 1000), that he had put aside when he was still employed by the Kenyan government. By 1998, the clinic's business had grown tremendously, so that he had moved locations thrice, in order to accommodate the immense need for medical services. <P>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately in 1998, he encountered several difficulties when the landlord where his business was located increased the rent to four times higher; the rent shot from about US$ 570 to US$ 1715. He therefore found that due to this steep increase in overhead, he could no longer manage to pay the workers he had employed, let alone continue with the operations of the clinic. Apart from this, his clinic also suffered tremendously due to non-payment of medical bills, i.e., many patients he had admitted failed to remit payments. To further compound the problem, many of these patients were either relatives or neighbours from his home area, making it more difficult for him to reclaim payments, since culturally, it would seem very insensitive of him. By the year 2001, he had incurred a working loss of Ksh. 1.5 million, (US$ 21,430). This amount has not been paid to date. <P>\r\n\t\r\nIn addition to these problems, he encountered another issue when he traveled to attend a seminar and was away for three months. Upon his return, he found that his staff had stolen and sold off most of the medical equipment he had acquired, and the clinic had actually been run down.  This was a very difficult experience for him, therefore he decided to close what was remaining of the clinic, and he carried away the little furniture that was left. It is with this furniture that he decided to start off a small clinic within Kayole, an informal settlement within Nairobi. <P>\r\n\r\nThe Exodus clinic is located in the Kayole area of Nairobi, in the middle of a low-income group of residents. The clinic is formally registered with the Ministry of Health in Kenya. Most of the patients that Dr. M. attends to are mothers and children, together with HIV\/AIDS patients. His aim of setting up the clinic was to reach the less privileged in Kenyan society, by providing medical service that is affordable for them. <P>\r\n\r\nDr. M. now intends to set apart a child welfare clinic within his premises, from where he will be in a better position to provide services related to the growth and well-being of children ages five years and below, from the Kayole area. From here he intends to provide vaccinations and health education for the parents, and he will also include family planning services. As an extension, he intends to provide home-based care, that is, door-to-door vaccination services, and generally attempt to raise the awareness of the community concerning the importance of vaccination for children. <P>\r\n\r\nDr. M. is therefore requesting a loan amounting to US$ 950 with which he will be able to partition off a part of the treatment room, in order to create space for the child welfare clinic. The loan will also enable him to purchase furniture for his clinic, acquire an assortment of medical drugs, a scale for babies, surgical forceps and scissors. He will also purchase a small television set that will keep the children busy as they wait to receive treatment.  He intends to repay the loan within a period of 12 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":78448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Medical

She has four children. She works selling basic grains. She has run this business for more than six years. Her shop is located in her home. Her business is run with little capital, but with much desire to get ahead. She must pay her household expenses as well as provide food and education for her children. Little by little she has increased her inventory using the small income her business generates. Her customers return to her shop because Martha is very helpful and always attends to her customers with a smile. The funds she is requesting will be used as capital to purchase rice, sugar, beans, oil and corn. Her greatest dream is for her children to complete their studies and get ahead.

He sells all types of men\u2019s and women\u2019s cotton pants. When he started his business, he was selling pants he had sewn himself. As it took a long time and a lot of hard work to sew each pair of pants, he started to sell ready made ones. Today, his working capital exceeds 2,200,000 tugrugs (~1,520 USD) and his sales are approximately 2,000,000 tugrugs (~1,380 USD) per month with a profit of 300,000-400,000 tugrugs (~210-270 USD).\r\n\r\nBatsukh is an experienced and hardworking businessman.

Ameen s.a.l. offers special incentives to loan officers who recruit female clients.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect her (i.e. blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in her picture, not indicating her name and location, etc.). Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

More than anything, Christian considers himself an educator.  Christian, once a victim of poor credit himself, tells his clients how he raised his credit score from 400 and now owns two cars and a house.

In order to improve her small business, she needs more products, and for this reason requires financing in order to purchase:  4 quintal (about 400 kilos) of rice at US$42 per quintal, 2 quintals of sugar at US$26 per quintal, 1 quintal of beans at US$80 per quintal, 2 bags of bath tissue at US$10 per bag, 2 cans of oil at US$27 each, 2 cases of soda at US$19 each, 3 cases of 3 minute soup at US$25 each, 2 cases of Maggie soup at US$7 each, and 3 cases of sardines at US$19 per case\r\n\r\n\r\nTranslated from Spanish by Elizabeth Novesky, Kiva translator\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Norma A. tiene 70 a\u00f1os de edad, es originaria de Bluefields, es viuda y aunque  tiene  7 hijos solamente vive con dos de ellos y unos nietos.Desde hace 28 a\u00f1os administra una pulperia en donde vende granos basicos, gaseosas, carne de res, pollo, chiverias y otros productos. Una de las ventajas que tiene este negocio es que en ese sector solamente existen dos pulperias las cuales cubren un radio de dos manzanas, lo que hace que tengan bastantes clientes. Al igual que muchas pulperias do\u00f1a Norma le da credito a sus clientes, pero solamente a los buenos pagadores ya que en el pasado muchos quedaron morosos con el negocio. Para superarse en este peque\u00f1o negocio necesita mas productos y para tal fin requiere de un financiamientos para comprar:  4 quintales de arroz a US$ 42 dolares cada quintal, 2 quintales de azucar a US$ 26 dolares el quintal, 1 quintal de frijolesa US$ 80 dolares el quintal, 2 bolsones de belvet (papel higienico) a US$ 10 dolares cada bolson, 2 bidones de aceite a US$ 27 dolares cada

She reports she has been a part of this group for approximately 4 years. When she joined she was a little uncertain and afraid that she wouldn't be able to pay off the debt, but since she needed money she took the risk. She sells candy and ice cream at a sports field and it's going well for her. With that income she has been able to get her family ahead by herself, since she is a widow. Her daughter is also in the group. Right now she needs the loan to be able to repair her ice cream machine. The other members of the group also have their own businesses such as the sale of clothes, stuffed animals, ice cream, baked goods, sewing clothing, and the sale of cards and internet service. They all need the loan, once again, to continue investing in their businesses and to grow day by day. \r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

She lives in the neighborhood of San Francisco de Rum\u00ed Pamba, an hour and a half from Cant\u00f3n San Miguel in Bolivar province. \r\nNancy is a member of the rural loan group \"San Francisco de Rumi Pamba\", which is composed of 25 members in total, of whom the majority are farmers. \r\nNancy has worked in agriculture all her life, and this is the primary source of income for her family. Among the most outstanding crops of her area are: corn and potatoes. Every harvest time, she sells her produce in the city of Guaranda.\r\nNancy is requesting a loan to buy urea soil additive, fertilizers, and seeds. Her goal is to improve her land so that it will bring her greater income. One of the challenges that she faces is that at harvest time the price of produce is very low. There is also a risk of loosing her crop. Nancy says that in her free time she helps her mother with the household chores and when there isn't much work to do she goes out for a stroll in San Miguel.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":537238,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Urea soil additives, fertilizer, and seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"San Miguel","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":159,"posted_date":"2010-05-09T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy Maribel   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:48:17Z","rounded_local_amount":700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188659658}],"funded_date":"2010-05-13T03:48:28Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:48:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Hynd","image":607121}},{"id":203542,"name":"The United Brothers Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These are members of the \u201cUnited Brothers\u201d group.

She earns her living by selling fish. Her husband, Vicente D., is 49 years old and works as a baker. As time permits, he also helps his wife in her business. The couple has seven children who range in age from 7 to 24 years old.  Four of her children are already employed and helping out while the other three are still in school. Teresita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she wanted a better life for her family. With the help of eight previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she is succeeding in lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. She is applying for a new loan for PHP 11,000 which she intends to use to increase her income so that she can repair her house.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through its poverty alleviation program, NWTF is empowering women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.
