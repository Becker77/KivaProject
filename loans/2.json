She manages the business and also packs their finished products for their later sale.  They use delivery vehicles to make their sales, which they pay for with a percentage of the sales they make.  Her brother makes their products.\r\n\r\nWhen they started their business, Celia says it was difficult because they didn't have any capital.  Their first investments were made thanks to their savings and help from their parents.  Celia, along with her brother, who is always attending to their business, are getting ahead.  Their goal is to have their own location.  She says she is very happy with the help that Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya has offered them through their credits and the confidence that they have in her.  She uses the credits to purchase supplies (flour, egges, anise, yeast, butter, etc.).<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva

and wanted to earn money on their own. Once they found a coffee shop for sale on the internet, they knew buying it was the perfect chance to take. Over the last three years, they have invested significant amounts of time and money into renovating the cafe, even cashing in their 401k. Many of the cafe's customers  had left when the cafe became run-down, before Heidi and her husband bought it. Their hard work has paid off - they have been able to get back many old customers, who remark how positive the new management has been for the business. \n\nThey will use this ACCION USA loan to help remodel their kitchen so that they can add new equipment, like a deep fryer and a basic stove, to add more food items like soups, sandwiches, and french fries to their menu. With these new items, they think they can increase their profit margin.\n\nIn the past, Heidi has used credit cards as a cash cushion\/emergency fund when unforeseen expenses come up, but she says that interest rates are so high nowadays that the convenience is not worth the price. She is thankful that she was able to receive the ACCION USA loan so that she will not have to pay so much interest. \n\nIn the future, Heidi plans to grow the coffee by opening up in more locations and possibly roasting her own coffee beans. She looks forward to the day when she can hopefully pass the business down to her children!

His original profession is teaching the Koran. After some years of being a teacher, Mr. B. has decided to switch to photography and video recording, something he had been doing as a side activity before. With over 20 years of experience, he is very much in demand and enjoys a good reputation thanks to the high quality of his recordings, mostly  taken during weddings, christenings, birthday parties and so on. He has his own studio in Hamdallaye near the Tieba military base. In order to keep his business going and to better meet the customer demand, about two years ago he decided to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. He is now on his second individual loan, having duly repaid his earlier loan. The second loan will allow him to purchase a new camera, photo film, blank video tapes, batteries etc. His goal is to reach an average monthly  income of 95,000 West African Francs, which will be used essentially to increase his business capital, contribute to the family budget and pay off the interest on his loan. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":552614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchasing a photo camera and accessories (film, blank tapes, batteries etc)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-06-11T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ousmane ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.84},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:28Z","rounded_local_amount":25106.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699747},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:08Z","rounded_local_amount":25106.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913648},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":25106.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180786},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":25106.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476753},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":25106.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613463},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":25106.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751899}],"funded_date":"2010-06-11T23:31:22Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":211102,"name":"Ruby Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ruby tiene 23 a\u00f1os  de edad es soltera vive  con sus padres ella tiene un peque\u00f1o negocio del servcio de fotocopias, se inicio con el apoyo de sus padres.

","en":"Mohamad is a 33-year-old, single man from Bint Jbeil. Since 2005 he has owned a bookstore, in which he sells school books, stationery, school bags and photography. Mohamad previously dealt with A.-Majmoua and enjoys a good reputation. He is now asking for a loan to boost his business as the new academic year approaches. In the beginning he lacked capitA. and he improved it with the previous loan he obtained from the group. The business is now developing gradually. His good manner with customers and his reasonable prices at a time of economic difficulties distinguish him and his business from other bookshops in the neighborhood. Mohamad hopes to one day open another branch in another area and to keep developing his business to include different areas.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Arabic by Rebecca Saab Saade, Kiva

request for the third time.  Her son is getting married in October, and Natalya and her husband spent a lot of money on wedding preparations.

She was having some health issues so she could not work on tasks that require force. She has 3 children and 2 of them had suddenly developed illness which had left sequela. So everything is relied on her husband, Mr Li\u00ean, who works on their small piece of land so things are very difficult for the family. She then joined TYM and got a loan which she used to buy goods from H. Noi city then to resell. Everyday her husband would go to every hamlet in the village to sell the goods. After a while, someone she knows teaches her how to make those paper horses and other religious objects made with paper and bamboo that people would burn as offerings in religious ceremony. So she learned the trade since it is not a forceful task. She applied for a loan and started this business. She had since then obtained numerous loans totaling in the thousands usd. This had turned her life around, things have really improved for her family. She has a lot of customers especially during the end of the year (when there are a lot of ceremonies). Her income is 200-220 USD a month. This time she is requesting a loan of 1200 USD to buy material (paper, bamboo).\r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer.<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nHo\u00e0n c\u1ea3nh gia \u0111inh ch\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb H\u00e0, 39 tu\u1ed5i, tr\u01b0\u1edbc khi tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 r\u1ea5t kh\u00f3 kh\u0103n v\u1ec1 c\u1ea3 v\u1eadt ch\u1ea5t l\u1eabn tinh th\u1ea7n.

She began her business selling fruit and other products, but later noticed that selling beer was more profitable, and so she now sells beer.

Para Lucy lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de su trabajo es conseguir la ropa que vende, ya que es muy exigente con sus proveedores, espera tener en el futuro una tienda de ropa m\u00e1s grande donde pueda vender con mayor comodidad. Lleva 15 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y lo que m\u00e1s disfruta de su trabajo, es ver como le queda la ropa que vende a los peque\u00f1os clientes, puesto que a ella le gustan mucho los ni\u00f1os. Lucy desea que su negocio progrese y poder tener una mejor vida. Este es su segundo pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, al igual como hizo con su anterior cr\u00e9dito, desea pagarlo a tiempo y sin dificultades, en su banco comunal es muy respetada, ya que es la socia m\u00e1s activa y comprometida.

That is why her stall is very busy with customers. For Lucy, the most difficult part of the job is getting the clothes she sells, as it is very demanding dealing with the suppliers. She hopes in the future to have a larger clothing shop where she can sell with greater ease. \r\n\r\nShe has been doing this work for 15 years and what she enjoys most is to see how the clothes that she sells to her young clients look, because she is very fond of children. Lucy wants to advance her business and be able to have a better life. This is her second loan with MFP and like she did with her previous credit she wants to pay on time and without difficulties.

Marifjon, 34, is married and has three children. He lives in Spitamen town and works in the agricultural industry. Twelve years ago he decided to begin to cultivate land that he owned. He did so to generate more income that would enable him to support his family. \r\n<p>\r\nMarifjon grows wheat, corn and vegetables, which he must give the proper care so that he can produce a full, healthy harvest.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Thanks to her husband\u2019s support they were able to get a home of their own where they live in harmony.  \r\n\r\nAntonia joined the group of sales promoters through a friend\u2019s invitation.  They sell medicinal products that are very effective for the variety of ailments that people usually experience.  The business is profitable.  The products are expensive, and for every sale she receives a commission.  This pays the household expenses.  She has been in the business for four years.  \r\n\r\nShe has been given the opportunity to be part of the leadership; they serve as counselors for the new salespeople.  The leaders train and support the new people in their sales.  The leaders also motivate the new people to get ahead, and, with time, to specialize in order to set up a place to consult and tend to their customers in a personalized manner.  That will improve the health and quality of life of the customers.\r\n\r\nAntonia has worked with MFP for three years, and this is her sixth loan.  Concerning her work team, she is grateful for the organization and responsibility that the leaders require of each member.  With the 800 PEN she will buy merchandise that her customers need.

Winter temperatures can average -20 Celsius. Sixty percent of the city population live in tents called gers, with wooden frames covered by layers of wool felt. On average, households located in the Ger Districts use 5 tons of coal and 1.5 tons of wood per year. Sixty percent of the pollution in the city during the heating season is attributed to coal burned in the Ger Districts. The bottom fifth spend as much as 40% of their monthly winter income on heating fuels.\r\n\r\nXacBank has worked with MicroEnergy Credits to launch a line of eco-products consisting of energy

This has been her means of working to help out her children.  She lives in the Memorial Sandino neighborhood where she has many clients.  She purchases the pork, butchers it, then sells it as meat, as well as selling fries, chicharron, tamales, sausage, and lard, getting more out of a pig than she would by selling it whole.  Some months ago she had a lot of difficulty due to the swine flu, because sale of pork products was prohibited.  This was a critical time for her, since this is what she knows how to do.  She is growing more tired, but thanks to God she is getting ahead now in pork sales.  With this loan she will buy several pigs for butchering in order to improve her profits.  The loans from Afodenic have been quite beneficial to her, enabling her to keep her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Sanford, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":492095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of several pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-02-21T02:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felix Amada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28.87,"local_amount":577.48,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:27Z","rounded_local_amount":605.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604544},{"amount":28.05,"local_amount":560.99,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:31:13Z","rounded_local_amount":588.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144640017},{"amount":27.73,"local_amount":554.65,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:25Z","rounded_local_amount":581.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821805},{"amount":28.35,"local_amount":566.92,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":594.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561815},{"amount":28.1,"local_amount":561.93,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:29Z","rounded_local_amount":589.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770734},{"amount":27.69,"local_amount":553.78,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:46:14Z","rounded_local_amount":580.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204625},{"amount":28.12,"local_amount":562.45,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":589.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177330332},{"amount":53.09,"local_amount":1061.8,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1113.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182465495}],"funded_date":"2010-02-21T02:54:13Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T11:42:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Geoffrey and Susan Gall","image":107956}},{"id":182373,"name":"Areas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo \u00c1reas est\u00e1 integrado por tres personas trabajadoras  y emprendedoras los cuales se dedican a comercializar perecederos.

On average, they are 37 years old and have four children. They all live in Darabougou, a village in the rural community of Sakoiba (4th administrative region of Mali). They know each other through parent, marriage, and neighbor connections. This group of women works with condiments (tomato concentrate, onions, etc.), in the restaurant business, and makes pasta from buckwheat flour, Fatoumata M.'s specialty. In order to meet their customers' needs, they decided to join Soro Yiriwaso; they are asking for their first loan together.\r\nFatoumata M. has made wholewheat spaghetti with the help of a manual machine for five years. She plans on using this loan to buy 25 kg of flour, 2 kg of salt, and other ingredients. To make spaghetti each day, she kneads 4 kg of flour until it forms a smooth, homogeneous paste. With her machine, she transforms this paste into spaghetti of varying thickness which she dries on cotton canvas mats.  The pasta is protected by a light, white fabric for sanitary purposes.

This group is from the community of San Pablo Huantepec in the town of Jilotepec, State of Mexico, in Mexico.  The members of the group are photographed at Marisol\u2019s snow cone stand.  She started her natural snow cone business a year ago.  Marisol is requesting a loan to buy containers and ingredients that are needed to make her product.  She says that she currently has a limited supply of materials; therefore she only offers a few flavors.  With this loan she hopes to diversify her product and attract more customers.  However, she needs these items to maintain her business.  Her customers consist of travelers, which explains why her stand is located on the side of the road and constantly changes location since she looks for strategic areas where she can improve her sales.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Mar\u00eda de los Santos M. S. is Marisol\u2019s mother.  They have been working together making snow cones for three years.  Just like her daughter, Mar\u00eda started her working so that she could gain experience.  She now wants to start her own business and live independently because she believes there may come a time in the future when her children won\u2019t be able to support her financially.  Mar\u00eda thought it would be best to have her own small business so that she could save and build up some assets for when she is not able to work so that she and her husband can continue to live decently.  Upon applying for this loan, Mar\u00eda was very excited because she wants to be self-sufficient for many years to come and believes this project will help her do that.  She is 46 years old, married, and has four children (three daughters and a son).  Mar\u00eda has a sixth grade education.  She will use her loan to buy snow cone cups, ice chests, glasses, scoops, spoons, and raw materials needed to start her business.  She expects to generate income gradually so that she can save for a better future.\r\n<p>\r\nMaricela S. M. is the group president.  She is 22 years old, married, and has two daughters who are both 3 years old.  Maricela completed her education through the third year of high school.  She started a pizzeria a year ago.  Maricela is requesting a loan to buy a screened door for her business so that her shop stays clean.  She wants to provide her children with the opportunity to study.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group consists of 12 members.  This is the first time they have requested a loan from CrediCom\u00fan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married with five children who are between the ages of nine and twenty. Four of the children are currently attending school. Pamela has been farming for the last twenty years in Kitale town, western Kenya. Her mixed farm produces maize, beans, bananas and milk which she sells locally.

She earns her living by operating one business venture: a sari-sari (general) store  business. She has 3 children who are 15 to 24 years old. \r\n\r\nLucy  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1994 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lucy  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500 which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future and cover their daily needs. Lucy  A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

is a 27-year-old woman who lives in Oebufu village and is married to Alex, a 30 year old man.  They have three children:  5 year-old Indi, who is in kindergarten, and Inda and Intan, who are 4 and 3 years old.  \r\n\r\nEmi, a woman who diligently attends family worship services, runs a billiard business. She purchased a secondhand billiard table and leases it to those who love to play this kind of sport. She has been running the billiard business for about three years. The condition of the billiard cloth is currently not good \u2013 it is scratched and it has an impact on her income. The income from her billiard business is currently between IDR 20,000 - 30,000 per day.  Her husband's income from the motor-taxi business is unstable. \r\n\r\nErni also farms vegetables. The farm is situated close to her house. She grows vegetables in a small quantity as she only had a little money to buy seeds and fertilizer. When she heard about TLM Lending Programs, she thought about improving the farm with various vegetable seeds and sufficient fertilizer.

All of these businesspeople will use their loans to add to their current businesses.\r\n<p>\r\nPrevious loans have helped them a lot. John was able to buy a new sewing machine with previous loans.

They named their group Active Group. They are local entrepreneurs in the town of Makeni. This is the fifth time they\u2019ve received a Kiva loan through SMT. Most recently, each one in the group received a loan of 600,000 LE. That loan created meaningful impacts in the lives of these borrowers: they were able to use the proceeds to pay for their children\u2019s school fees and were also able to feed and clothe themselves and their children with the income generated from the loans. They could also add to the daily allowances their husband\u2019s give them for food. Today, they are requesting a loan of 800,000 LE each to buy more goods to add to their businesses.\r\n<P>\r\nKadiatu S. (right) is the leader of the group. She is thirty-five years of age. She was born in Kabala in the Koindadugu District, north of Sierra Leone. Marriage brought her to Makeni City where today she is managing her business. She is married with five children. Three of her children are in secondary school and the other two are in primary school. Her husband is a civil servant, working for the Ministry of Agriculture. Kadiatu sells locally produced items like rice, ground nuts and palm oil. She has been in this business for over 15 years now.\r\n<P>\r\nWith this new loan, Kadiatu will expand her business. She will be able to buy at least 266 pans of ground nuts and 1,000 cups of rice. Kadiatu buys the ground nuts and rice from Kabala, a 180-mile round trip. The fare to and from Kabala is 24,000 LE. In Kabala, a measuring pan of ground nuts costs her 1500 LE. She sells a pan in Makeni at 3000 LE. A cup of rice costs her 4000 LE in Kabala and she sells it at Le 6000 in Makeni.\r\n<P>\r\nThe only challenge she is facing in her business is the difficulty of getting vehicles to transport her goods from the farming villages where the items are grown to Kabala. Vehicles seldom travel those routes because of bad roads. And the few that do brave the roads often charge higher prices. To Kadiatu and colleagues in the group, an increase in profit means making their lives better.

Greshiel is separated from her spouse and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Greshiel owns and operates a business venture making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling specialty food products, such as fish balls. She also sells stick brooms in the local community. Greshiel has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Greshiel joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Greshiel has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI. Greshiel is requesting another loan of 4000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Greshiel from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

With experience gained over 20 years in the purchase and sales of cattle, Begmat has been able to bring stability to his family. \r\n<p>\r\nBegmat would now like to purchase more cattle to create more income for his large family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Luciana is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Luciana from HSPFI.

He lives in the village of Lchashen, in the Gegharkunik region, with his mother, his wife and two young daughters. Albert's mother is an invalid, and his wife teaches at a rural school, but at the moment is on maternity leave. After graduating from high school, Albert lived in Russia for many years, and on his return to Armenia he took a job at the Sevan bread factory as a baker. Along with his work at the bakery, Albert is engaged in agriculture.  He breeds cows, sheep and pigs, and he grows potatoes. The family's primary income comes from the sale of agricultural products, which enables him to support his family. Albert needs a loan of 500,000 drams to purchase feed for livestock, as well as to buy a few calves that will help him in the future to increase his family's income.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":824107,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

He is married, and has five children aged 2, 6, 9, 14 and 24 years. He has four additional dependents who live with him. They are his younger brother and sisters, and he assists with their schooling.  In 1995, Hassan established his provision and mobile phone card top-up business. He began his business because he wanted to be self employed and get a source of income to provide livelihood for his family. Working seven days a week and twelve hours a day, he earns about Le 1,600,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Hassan has already received and successfully repaid two loans, and now needs a new loan in order to buy sugar, milk, margarine, mayonnaise, ovaltine and mobile phone recharge cards for his business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

Por eso, en aras de incrementar sus ingresos econ\u00f3micos se ha avocado tambi\u00e9n a la siembra de flores, las cuales son muy rentables en los meses de mayo y octubre, pues llega a sacar m\u00e1s de lo previsto. Dependiendo de c\u00f3mo se encuentre el mercado, llega a vender la docena a 80 soles, en el caso de cada paquete (como nos muestra en la foto), los vende entre 6 a 7 soles. Entonces prefiere sembrar justo para que cosechar en las fechas de mayor demanda, ya que de ese modo ayuda econ\u00f3micamente a su madre y a su hermana menor en sus estudios, y eso lo llena de mucha satisfacci\u00f3n. Esta es la primera vez que tiene la oportunidad de acceder a un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP y es debido a la invitaci\u00f3n de un integrante de un banco comunal quien lo recomend\u00f3.

He lives with his mother and his sister whom he loves a lot. Five years ago he started to plant flowers (gladiolus) on his mother\u2019s small farm and other times on rented land. Since he was 18 he has grown peas which has gone very well. Therefore, in the interest of increasing his income, he started to plant flowers. The flowers are very profitable in the months of May and October, and he has earned more than he foresaw. Depending on how the market is, he can sell a dozen flowers for 80 soles. Each package (as he shows us in the photo) sells for 6 or 7 soles. Therefore he prefers to plant so that he harvests in the times of highest demand since he financially helps his mother and his younger sister in her studies, which gives him great satisfaction. This is the first time that he has had the opportunity to access a loan with MFP and it is due to the invitation of a member of a community bank who recommended him. Marcos commits to adhering to the rules and being punctual in all of his payments. With the money he is asking for right now he will buy chemical fertilizers to fertilize the plot of gladiolus flowers and therefore have a good production in the month of October.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kelley Maynard, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":368301,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Flowers","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fertlizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-12T17:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1029,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959577}],"funded_date":"2009-08-13T00:34:24Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kelley Maynard","image":248986}},{"id":132479,"name":"Merlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merlita D.

Zaida is 50 years old. Her husband, Ernesto, works as a tricycle driver and also helps manage their duck-raising business. They have four children with one still attending school. The family lives in the village of Mambagaton, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental.\r\n<p>\r\nZaida raises ducks and sells the duck eggs to several regular customers in nearby villages, towns and cities. She thought of this business because their location is very conducive to duck raising with mostly farmlands in the surrounding area.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2003, she joined NWTF Project Dungganon to access additional capital for her business. When she received her loan, she used it to buy more ducks and feed. Now her operation is big enough that she has hired a caretaker to watch the ducks (she now has more than 350 ducks and they produce more than 200 eggs per day). She now earns a monthly income of about 24,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) and she saves most of this for the education of her youngest son and also to defray household expenses. \r\n<p>\r\nHer previous loan of 19,500 PHP was used as additional capital for her duck-raising business. She was able to repay her loan on time and in full without delays, and she has maintained her good record. Now on her 14th loan cycle, she is borrowing 20,000 PHP which she intends to use as working capital so that she can buy eggs from other duck raisers to meet the demand of her customers.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <i>Dungganon<\/i> (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

Teresita has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 4000 PHP when she sells one of her pigs.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Teresita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her business and living situation. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 16000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 18000 PHP, which she will use to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the eighth loan taken by Teresita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & provide working capital. He is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be his 2nd loan from ASKI.

She is full of energy and motivation to improve her business, which had been founded 12 years ago. After tying the marriage knot, Sapargul and her husband, like most families in Uzgen, took their first small steps in starting a livestock business. Back then, Sapargul could never have guessed that 5000 soms of starting capital would turn out to be possibly the best investment in all her career. Raising livestock always has been socially important for the local population, along with farming and trade. Already as a young girl, Sapargul would go together with her friends to guard farm animals at grazing fields with plenty of fresh grass and spring water. And now our client still takes the issue of nutrition and other living conditions of her livestock very responsibly. She has her animals regularly examined by  a veterinarian, since the products she sells have a direct impact on consumers\u2019 health. In recent years, however, storm clouds have gathered over this business. An increase in expenditures led to a reduced business revenue, and the attempt to raise prices in a perceptible way has been met with anger by the consumers. It had come to the point that their monthly income fell all the way down to 2,000 soms, which was insufficient even to provide for the day-to-day needs of their two children: their daughter Akhbermet, who is in 7th grade, and their 3-year old son Emir. This was the last drop for Sapargul, and she decided to also go into agriculture as a parallel activity. Uzgen offers auspicious conditions for agriculture. This idea led Sparagul to forming a group in order to take out a loan from Kiva. The concrete purpose of this loan is purchasing fertilizer to prepare soil in the spring."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":729541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Uzgen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2011-03-18T09:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sapargul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0427\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0430","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"\u0420\u0430\u0437\u0438\u044f","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3228},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3327},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3539},{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3656},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":3788},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3989},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":4153},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":4320}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.94},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.09},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.22},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.07},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.43},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.98},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":69.94,"local_amount":3228,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:34:49Z","rounded_local_amount":3317.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201324294},{"amount":72.91,"local_amount":3365,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:30:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3458.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206192742},{"amount":76.72,"local_amount":3541,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-17T08:05:56Z","rounded_local_amount":3639.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211571546},{"amount":78.35,"local_amount":3616,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3716.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216546206},{"amount":82.07,"local_amount":3788,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:10:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3893.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221714802},{"amount":86.43,"local_amount":3989,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:54:16Z","rounded_local_amount":4100.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227085129},{"amount":89.98,"local_amount":4153,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:44:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4268.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232846792},{"amount":93.6,"local_amount":4320,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":4440.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238661822}],"funded_date":"2011-03-19T00:32:36Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:52:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":284911,"name":"Neri","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La socia pertenece al banco comunal\u201d VILCANOTA\u201d; El banco est\u00e1 ubicado en el distrito de Urubamba,  perteneciente a la provincia de Urubamba y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

She is married to Florante, a businessman, and she is the mother of their children. Together they work hard for a safe and secure future for their family.\r\n\r\nEncarnacion operates a meat business. She buys live pigs, cows and chickens directly from hog raisers, livestock and poultry dealers, slaughters them, and then delivers them to the fast food chains. She has several fast food chain company patrons who buy the cut meat. They prefer Encarnacion\u2019s products since they are assured of its freshness and cleanliness. It is also a little cheaper to buy meat from an independent meat dealer than the ones in the market who sometimes use the services of professional slaughter houses for their meat. The cost of slaughter is added to the final price of the cut meat and passed along to the customers. Thus, Encarnacion has many patrons who regularly anticipate her meat. Her regular customers are Chowking and Teriyaki Boy. She earns a minimum of PHP 933 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 12,000. She will be using the loan to buy meat and chicken to be delivered to fast food chains. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nEncarnacion hopes that her business will continue to be successful, just as she fervently hopes that her children will be able to graduate one day and be finished with their studies.

She is married and has two children - the oldest is 28 years old and the youngest - 27. Her husband works as a master cabinet maker in the locale furniture factory. Larisa's older son is married and lives with his own family and the youngest son is working in Russia. Since 2002 Larisa has been managing her own business: she sells women's and men's shoes and clothes in a rented market stall at the Kapan's city market. Larisa travels to the capital city of Erevan once a month. She does not take weekends off and so helps her husband and her family's income. Larisa needs a loan of 300,000 dram to purchase clothing for the fall season in preparation for the starting college school year. This is Larisa's 9th loan with KIVA and she has never been late to pay back her debt. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":845647,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fall season young adult clothes for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AM","country":"Armenia","town":"Kapan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40 45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":146,"posted_date":"2011-08-10T18:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Larisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AMD","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":21570},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":23520},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":23620},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":24330},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":24480},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":24850},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25390},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":25620},{"due_date":"2012-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":26010},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":26450},{"due_date":"2012-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":26840},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":27320}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.32},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.68},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.95},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.91},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.32},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.34},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.82},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.46},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.52},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.74},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.81},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.13}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":65.81,"local_amount":23930,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:58:18Z","rounded_local_amount":24198.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232866032},{"amount":71.28,"local_amount":25920,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:09:03Z","rounded_local_amount":26210.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238682065},{"amount":71.64,"local_amount":26050,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:53:18Z","rounded_local_amount":26341.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244637517},{"amount":73.7,"local_amount":26800,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:04:00Z","rounded_local_amount":27100.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250853913},{"amount":74.19,"local_amount":26980,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:31:14Z","rounded_local_amount":27282.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257263612},{"amount":75.35,"local_amount":27400,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:44:00Z","rounded_local_amount":27706.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263404790},{"amount":76.89,"local_amount":27960,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":28273.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270119207},{"amount":77.66,"local_amount":28240,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:47:09Z","rounded_local_amount":28556.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276736223},{"amount":78.84,"local_amount":28670,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-20T08:33:28Z","rounded_local_amount":28991.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283226667},{"amount":80.13,"local_amount":29140,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:00:11Z","rounded_local_amount":29466.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287457199},{"amount":79.51,"local_amount":28910,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-17T08:22:51Z","rounded_local_amount":29233.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294636213}],"funded_date":"2011-08-20T17:56:47Z","paid_date":"2012-08-17T08:22:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":329994,"name":"Lourdes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lourdes is 53 years old and married with five children.

M.  lives in the Luz de Barranquilla neighborhood.  She is 34, and together with her spouse (at left in the photo) she has a business making and selling foods, a business she started when her spouse was unemployed after having worked with one company for 20 years.  From there she had the idea to make delicious dishes of rice with fish and rice with chicken.  Part of her routine is to arise very early, starting the task of preparing the rice at 2:00 am, so that later her spouse can go out selling it at a strategic spot at the exit from the city of Barranquilla on the way to the city of Santa Marta.  Bellamis joined the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation program three years ago and has received three loans.  Currently she is requesting a loan of $800, partly to enlarge her tiny kitchen that hardly holds the industrial range that she bought with the last loan.  With the rest she will buy raw materials and supplies in large volume, in order to pay the best price for her supplies and increase her profits.  This will greatly help her 3 children, ages 17, 16 and 1, to get ahead.  She fully agrees with her spouse that there is much to be done, because the two elder are studying for their BA and the younger is in a public daycare.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

Also it gives her a lot of pain to recall that her husband passed away at the same time due to a heart attack.

Perlita is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like fruits, vegetables and dry goods. This will be the 18th loan taken out by Perlita from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her business and to financially support her family. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years. Based in Bohol, they have numerous branches throughout the Philippines. In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring. CEVI not only provides credit for its clients but additionally savings, insurance, and training which are provided through regular cluster group meetings.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":585307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Nghi\u00eam Th\u1ecb (20201020065) is a 31 year-old female living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh. C. is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by SEDA. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Nghi\u00eam X\u00e1 2 (8).\r\n\r\nC. is married and has 3 school-aged children. To making a living, C. owns & operates a business providing hairdressing & beauty services to local community members. C. has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 3,800,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, C. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. C. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & working capital.  She is now requesting a new loan of 7,840,000 VND which will be used to invest in renovating the business. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by C. from SEDA. C. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb S. (0) is a 62 year-old female who is requesting a 6,496,000 VND loan to support her business of making & selling food.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nC.

She is married to Enrique, 50, who is a driver. She is a mother of three children: Her eldest has just graduated from college; the second one is still in college; and the youngest is in high school. She keeps herself busy attending to the needs of her family and attending to her business.\r\n\r\nTeresita has a car wash. She has three car-wash boys who cater to their numerous customers. Their rate for a car wash depends upon the type of the vehicle. Car owners pay 60 Philippines pesos (Php), Jeepneys are Php 80, and delivery trucks are Php 100\u2013150. Her regular customers are the owners of the vehicles that reside within her community, and some are drivers who regularly pass by their busy area. She also sells different car accessories as additional income. She earns a minimum of 500 Php in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTeresita is requesting a loan amounting to 8,000 Php that will serve as additional capital. She will spend it to buy additional car accessories and tires for her business. She believes that different designs of car accessories will definitely help her boost her income. Her profits help her to pay water and electricity bills, and some are saved for future expenditures.  \r\n\r\nTeresita dreams of having another car wash in another area. She wants her children to become degree holders.

They formed the group to help finance their economic activities. There are many people in the committee who carry out a variety of activities to make a living. The loan they receive from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguay is very useful in financing each member's small businesses, which they have developed thanks to this program. All the women are mothers and hard workers, and what brings them together and strengthens their bond is a common commitment to the loan. <p>\r\nThe loan will be used to purchase various items, the majority being raw materials or supplies for the members' various business activities. For example, Mar\u00eda Beatriz C. plans to invest her loan in the purchase of fabrics, buttons, threads and all the other materials needed to make clothing. These types items will be acquired by all the members who work as seamstresses. Others who make a living selling desserts and candies will invest in the purchase of sugar, flour, vanilla, eggs, milk, among other items.

She enjoys making different crafts very much, and it is an activity that she can perform in her house whenever she wants.  At the same time, she can take care of her grandchildren.  She began the business in March 2006 thanks to a teacher that taught her to make crafts.  She first started making handbags and bathroom sets, and later began making things related to each coming season, such as paper flowers for the Day of the Dead and decorations for Christmas, Friendship Day, Children's Day, Mother's Day, etc.  Thanks to God, she has been getting more customers through recommendations from other people who liked her work.  She needs a loan of $6,000 MXN that she will repay in 12 installments that she will use to purchase raw materials such as cloth, glue, foamy, thread, scissors, paper, etc.  This will allow her make decorations that her customers entrust her to make for special dates and events.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Josh Wilcox, Kiva

She is 44; divorced; and the mother of 6 children who are 21, 17, 15, 13, 9, and 3.  Five of them are in school.  She studied through 10th grade and didn't continue due to the lack of financial resources.  She lives in her own home with her children in Boane and also supports her nephew who lives with her. <p>\r\nShe left Morumbene for Chowke (in the province of Gaza) in 1984 with her husband when he was transferred there for his job.  In 1986, he was transferred to Boane, where they started their home.  Later she separated from her husband, and she continues to live in the same home with her children.  She has worked as a community health worker at an orphanage (which is called Casa de Gaiato) for more than 8 years and has a monthly salary of 3,500 meticais, which she applies to her home's expenses and still saves some in the commercial bank, BCI.<p>\r\nShe has never had a loan with another bank.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through her colleages, who are also clients of the institution.  This is her second loan, and it is for 8,500 meticais.  She will use it to purchase construction materials (cement, sand, and to pay for labor) to continue expanding her home.  Her previous loan was for 7,000 meticais, which she used for the same purpose.<p>\r\nIn the future, she hopes to request more loans to be able to finish her home and to give more comfort to her
