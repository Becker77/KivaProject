Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":115363,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stock of shoes in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-01-17T05:45:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esinely","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-31T08:41:36Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":34285.71,"processed_date":"2008-02-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-31T09:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":34380,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145846},{"amount":30,"local_amount":34285.71,"processed_date":"2008-03-31T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-31T09:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":34380,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":170114},{"amount":30,"local_amount":34285.71,"processed_date":"2008-04-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-31T09:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":34380,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196946},{"amount":30,"local_amount":34285.71,"processed_date":"2008-05-31T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-31T09:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":34380,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":224204},{"amount":30,"local_amount":34285.71,"processed_date":"2008-06-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-31T09:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":34380,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":253251},{"amount":25,"local_amount":28571.43,"processed_date":"2008-07-31T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-31T09:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":28650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":282191}],"funded_date":"2008-01-17T08:41:36Z","paid_date":"2008-07-31T09:06:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":35593,"name":"Furaha 2 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Scholstica is single and 29 years old with no children.

In the morning, he pastures cattle in the mountain plains with neighboring children. In the evening, he comes back home. Mohira's husband works in a farm. He has only seasonal profit. That makes their cattle business their single source of income during the winter time. Mohira has been a client of MicroInvest since the middle of 2007. Using the first credit, she was able to buy a cow, and using the second one, she bought 2 young bulls.

Mado runs a cement store and also sells 10kg sacks of corn flour. She has been in business since 1994. She began her business with US$ 60, selling palm oil from 1994 to 1995. In 1996, her business slowed down because of the deterioration of her health. \r\n\r\nIn 1998, Mado decided to change her business by starting to sell rice, semolina and vegetable oil. Most of her working capital was focused on semolina because of the profit it was generating. Unfortunately, in 1999 many companies closed in DRCongo due to the war and insecurity, including those that were producing Mado\u2019s goods. So her business regressed until 2007 when she re-launched it, offering new types of products. She began selling women\u2019s slippers, vegetable oil, and corn flour. \r\n\r\nAfter learning through her friend about Hope\u2019s loan program, she decided to join one of its groups in May 2008. Mado has already received two loans from Hope that she repaid correctly. Currently, her working capital is about $170. With her next loan she is planning to purchase 28 10kg sacks of corn flour to increase the inventory of her business. Mado\u2019s dream is to do corn and manioc farming and be a provider of those products in her area. She runs her business in the northern and most populated area of Kinshasa.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":269043,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase 28 10kg sacks of corn flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

A Tajik chest is traditionally given to one's daughter when she marries, therefore the chests are continually in high demand.  Wood that has dried for three years is needed for construction of a chest, special tin for decoration and they are painted with paints made from natural dyes.  Abdugufron's chests are strong and beautiful and sell quickly.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in her own house and what she desires the most is to live in her old age in peace. She has a brick oven located in the outskirts of the city. Each morning she gets up very early to mix and mold the bricks, those of which afterward will dry for 10 days and she will put in her oven. This activity has generated an income for her that allowed her to give the best to her three children. It\u2019s for this reason that she is still doing it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, what she likes the most about her job is selling her bricks and seeing that her work is well worth it.

She is 57 years old. She was the third child in a large, low-income family. Because she had to help her mother in the household from early childhood, she left secondary school after the 7th grade. Damira got married at the age of 22. Soon she gave a birth to a son and two daughters. At that time Damira\u2019s husband started breeding sheep. It was not a very profitable activity and additional earnings were required in order to support their family. That\u2019s why, without education and practical knowledge, Damira decided get into sales.\r\n\r\nDamira started, as do many people in her situation, selling at a local market. Her start as an entrepreneur was successful due to strong efforts. Starting with a capital of only 2,000 Kyrgyz Som, she managed to multiply her investments within one year. After five years of selling groceries in the market, Damira managed to purchase a sales stall and open up a small grocery store near her house. From this moment the shop became a family business. Her grown up children started to help their mother in the shop. \r\n\r\nIn 2009, Damira obtained her first loan of 100,000 Kyrgyz Som from Bai Tushum and Partners. She used it to construct a shop on her own land. Her activity started to bring in permanent profit and her clientele increased.\r\n\r\nThen a tragic accident happened: her only son had a car accident. He needed expensive medical treatment. At the same time, Damira\u2019s granddaughter was born, which further increased the family\u2019s expenditures.\r\n\r\nDamira wants to take a loan of 100,000 Kyrgyz Som to expand the range of products in her shop. She hopes that this will help her increase her revenue. In the future, Damira plans to buy an apartment for her son in Karabalta and marry her daughters off well. \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

sawali making (woven bamboo mats used for walls), fish vending and a general store.  She lives in the municipality of Quezon, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her sawali making, fish vending and general store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,800. Nayme is now borrowing PHP 15,000 to fund the operation of her business.  This will be her eighth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Nayme aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

As Wiliani has 2 children who are still studying at school and her husband\u2019s income as a farmer is not always reliable, she uses the pig farming business to support the family. She gets Rp.700,000 (about $76) of profit per 6 months. 1 piglet usually can be sold for Rp.150.000 (about $16) to Rp.175.000 (about $19) and 1 female pig usually can give birth to 5 to 10 piglets.

Wiliani sangat bersyukur sekali atas pinjaman yang diberikan oleh DINARI. Karena melalui pinjaman ini Wiliani bisa membeli 6 ekor bibit untuk penggemukan ,dengan harapan usahanya ini semakin maju dan hasil yang diperolehpun lebih meningkat."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":68892,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To add more growing pigs and pig's food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-09-26T15:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Luh Wiliani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-10T16:42:34Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-10-11T04:47:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65673},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-23T03:20:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85215},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:15:44Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100222},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-17T04:04:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116783},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-18T02:26:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137354},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:23:54Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:24:55Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164640}],"funded_date":"2007-09-26T16:42:34Z","paid_date":"2008-03-24T04:23:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":23321,"name":"Somaly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. I.

Jos\u00e9 is retired from the Mozambican Armed Forces.  He contributed his youth so that the country could consolidate the victories gained with Independence in a climate of peace and harmony among Mozambicans.  In this process of civil war that occurred in the country, he lost a leg, making him disabled.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nDespite this, Jos\u00e9 didn't lose heart, neither did he let himself become depressed, and much less consider himself disabled.  To the contrary--he rolled up his sleeves and went to fight.  The fight to secure daily bread for his family.  Because his disability pension that he gets from the Ministry of Defense isn't sufficient to sustain his family, he decided to enroll in the FDM credit program to be able to benefit from a loan.  This is how he came to buy clothing in Maputo and sell them in one of the markets in the city of Xai-Xai.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nUnfortunately, his wife, not contenting herself with a disabled husband, robbed him of some of his goods and left him and the children, still young.  This was two years ago.  At the moment, Jos\u00e9 isn't thinking of finding another wife.  He says he has strength to raise the children alone.  Still, it's possible in the medium-term future that he'll consider finding a companion.  But he would be really careful to choose the one that would become his future wife and mother of his children, to not fall into the same trap he fell into the first time.  But despite this, Jos\u00e9 is convinced that life shouldn't stop, that the only path is forward.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe travels twice a month to Maputo in order to buy clothes and sandals for his stall.  On the first trip he bought clothing worth 3000 meticais, and on the second trip, clothing worth 1500, as it was to replenish stock.  In the future, if the business goes well, he's thinking of improving his home using conventional building materials, as it is currently made of wood and stucco.<p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Portuguese by Ilse Ackerman, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n<p>\r\nJose Alberto M., nao casou oficialmente, mas vivia com uma mulher com quem teve 3 filhos.

Ele contribuiu com a sua juventude para que o Pais pudesse consolidar as conquistas alcancadas com a Independencia num clima de paz e harmonia entre os Mocambicanos. Nesse processo de guerra civil que gracou o Pais ele ficou sem uma perna o que lhe relegou a uma posicao de deficiente fisico.<p>\r\n<p>\r\nApesar disso Jose nao desanimou, e nem se deixou abater muito menos considerar-se invalido. Antes pelo contrario arregacou as mangas e foi a luta. Luta para garantir o pao de cada dia para o seu agregado familiar. Pelo facto de a sua pensao de invalidez que ele recebe do Ministerio de Defesa nao ser suficiente para sustentar sua familia, ele resolveu entrar para o programa de credio do FDM para poder se beneficiar de um emprestimo. Assim ele passou a comprar roupa em Maputo e a vende-la num dos mercados da cidade de Xai-Xai.<p>\r\n<p>\r\ninfelizmente a sua esposa certamente nao se contentando em ter um marido deficiente fisico, roubou-lhe alguns bens e abandonou-o a ele e aos filhos ainda menores. isto faz 2 anos. Neste momento Jose nao pensa em arranjar outra mulher. Diz ele que tem forcas para criar os filhos sozinho. Todavia e possivel que num futuro a medio prazo pensa em arranjar uma companheira.

From a very early age she wanted to be independent and currently helps her parents plant and harvest efficiently.  She produces cocoa beans and coca leaves to sell and has gradually been improving her sales.  She owes all this to her parents who taught her the skills and gave her the tools to be an efficient farmer.\r\n\r\nRosa realizes that there are many things still to improve both with respect to quality and to quantity and she will achieve this as time passes; it\u2019s only the lack of funds that keeps her from introducing mechanization that would allow for large scale production.\r\n\r\nGenerally she works alone but occasionally her family helps her; she always needs help from field hands during harvest time, however.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is already a widow and she is both father and mother to three young hard-working adults. By the grace of God, Fe has managed to support her children's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nFe P. operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling at piece rate.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 9,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more groceries, toiletries and beverages, etc. to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nFe  dreams of being able to renovate her house soon, with all of her work with the business.

She is a successful bread salesperson, making the most delicious breads in the Laykakota Market (a well-known market in the city of Puno). <p>\r\n\r\nShe likes to converse with her neighbors, but she hates to sell her breads when it's raining, because the market always ends up getting wet. She knows that to succeed she needs to work very hard and she already has 10 years of experience in this tiring business. In the future, she'd like to have a store where she could sell her breads and other products, and also offer more amenities to her clients.

He works as a cab driver in and around the city of El Alto.  He starts work at 6:00am and finishes around 8:00pm.  His wife, Sra. Pastora, earns money selling food in the 16 de Julio market on Thursdays and Sundays.  People congregate in the market to buy what they need and enjoy the variety of dishes for sale.  The family's greatest dream is to build a house of their own, a dream that they work for with all their might.  Sr. Eusebio helps his wife with food sales because she sells a lot on market days and needs his help.  With the money from the loan, Sr. Eusebio will buy the supplies that his wife needs to make her delicious meals.

They have four children who are between 21 and 40 years old. \r\n\r\nDelia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 12 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Delia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 13th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15000, with which she intends to buy stock for the general store and fertilizers for her rice and corn plantation so that she can continue to save for future improvements to the businesses. \r\n\r\nDelia D.

After eight solidarity (group) loans, all of which have been fully repaid, she is on her eighth individual loan and the seven preceding loans have been fully repaid.\r\n\r\nShe intends to buy 10 bags of n\u00e9r\u00e9 nuts with this loan.  She gets her supplies at the Koutiala Grand Market and sells her goods in Bamako (capital of Mali) and outside the country to a clientele composed of men and women in cash and by credit.  With her working capital bolstered, she estimates that she will earn an average profit of 150,000 CFA per month that she plans to use to pay the interest on the Soro loan and to support her family, as she is a widow.  Very courageous and motivated, she always depends on the Soro financing to build her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":778936,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy n\u00e9r\u00e9 nuts for making Sounbala","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-05-27T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.22},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.22},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.23},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.22},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.22},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.22},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":122.23},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.22},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":122.22,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:30Z","rounded_local_amount":56614.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750947},{"amount":122.22,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:52Z","rounded_local_amount":56614.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120257},{"amount":122.23,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":56614.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232882096},{"amount":122.22,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":56614.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699190},{"amount":122.22,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":56614.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655452},{"amount":122.22,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:57Z","rounded_local_amount":56614.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874262},{"amount":122.23,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":56614.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283053},{"amount":122.22,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-04T08:24:50Z","rounded_local_amount":56614.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424470},{"amount":122.22,"local_amount":55555.52,"processed_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":56614.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270139787}],"funded_date":"2011-05-28T01:12:51Z","paid_date":"2012-05-11T08:20:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Connie Archea","image":607010}},{"id":306906,"name":"Lusia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lusia is 42 years of age and married with five children.

She mainly offers rugs from those round palm-sized ones to the much larger doormats and other crafts that most rug-makers come up with every day. As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, rugs are one of the most common products that can be bought, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php15,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials like fabric, thread and other materials. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGeraldine dreams to be able to give all of her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. And she also wants to have her own warehouse for the rugs that she is selling. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n \r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is 62 years old, married and has seven children. While most of her children are adults, she still has her younger ones who go to school and hope to finish college someday. Dionisia owns and operates a business raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. She also raises ducks. Dionisia has been engaged in her business for over 25 years.\r\n\r\nDionisia joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to do business. Dionisia has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. Dionisia is requesting a new loan of 8,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Dionisia from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

She is 39 years old, married, and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Daisy owns and operates a business in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The primary source of income for the business comes from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, canned goods, snacks and toothpaste in the local community. Daisy has been involved in this business for over 15 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Daisy joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Daisy has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI. The previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Daisy is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell, such beverages and canned goods. This will be the third loan taken out by Daisy from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

He teaches mathematics in his town's secondary school.  His wife is a nurse at the local hospital, where she works with sick patients on the night shift.  On occasion he does not see his wife for a week at a time, and raising six children was no easy matter.  Adullo needed to find other sources of income, and took up driving a cab for a local taxi company.  In the beginning, his fares were in town, but now because the pay is higher he takes on ones further afield, to distant towns and regions throughout Tajikistan. Their children are now grown and each of them earns a living and assists his father, including one son who wires money from Russia.  Since business is good, his son recommended that he sell his current vehicle and seek assistance from MicroInvest for buying a new, more reliable vehicle better suited to mountain driving.  Acting on his son's advice, Abdullo took out a loan and together with the money he had saved purchased an SUV that carries more passengers and makes it easy to drive the mountain passes, both good for his earnings.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Joyce ., Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She lives with her daughter Katy, age 20, in her own home in the Palcamayo area. From her childhood, she has worked in agriculture and with livestock; \"I took care of my parents' pigs and helped with the harvest\", she says. With time, she invested her strength and time in improving; so when she was young, she worked as a baker for 10 years. She still sells breads, cakes and other products. From her earnings, she has been able to save money and purchase her own land to cultivate vegetables, products which she sells wholesale in the central market of the capital. She recently opened a small store in her home. This way, she will be able to generate additional income for herself. Working in agriculture does not give her enough income, so she found it necessary to find a partner to help her with the sowing and the harvest, so that she only works alone on her land until harvest time. Her greatest wish is to purchase and sell land and to continue supporting her daughter in her agribusiness studies. This is her tenth loan with MFP, and she is grateful for the support that her community bank has offered her in the development of her goals. With the 1000 soles that she is requesting, she will invest in the purchase of fertilizer for her next harvest, and pay her daughter's tuition.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":604533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase bags of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269331}],"funded_date":"2010-10-04T05:58:32Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":237268,"name":"Juana Liliana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En las afueras de Portoviejo en Km 5 v\u00eda Manta  encontramos el Banco Comunal Loma De Los Vientos, que se re\u00fanen cada quince d\u00edas, lugar de gente dedicada a la agricultura y cr\u00eda de animales.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Liliana tiene 26 a\u00f1os de edad y mantiene una relaci\u00f3n de uni\u00f3n libre de la cual tiene tres hijos de 6, 5, y una hermosa bebita de un a\u00f1o,  su marido trabaja en una granja de pollos, tiene una casa de ca\u00f1a.\n\nVende cartillas que es una modalidad de venta de artefactos en sistema acumulativo.

Previously, he sold vegetables wholesale and retail at a food market and then decided to change his speciality.  Since then, his income rose and currently amounts to 6 000 hryvnia.  Ivan plans to use the 7 000 hryvnia Kiva loan to buy winter tires and make regular repairs to his car engine.  This business is Ivan's primary source of income.  One of the goals that Ivan sets for himself is to purchase a newer car.  In the future, Ivan plans to continue working in this field because for now he does not see other, more interesting

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns a profit by buying supplies at wholesale prices and reselling them by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of PHP 22,000. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAmelita dreams of being able to give her all her children a good and high quality education through her hard work in her business. She also hopes to have her own grocery store. She faithfully meets with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God, which  she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Maria M. is married with four children.  She sells dried fish, vegetables, rice and candies in the village of Kikurala in Northern Sierra Leone. <P>Maria has been in business for five years but due to lack of capital, she could not make enough profit to expand and diversify her business.

All the previous loans have all been paid back in full and on time, and now they hope to receive an even larger loan. This group of 20 hardworking people have all started to realize that they have the ability to change their future, and have all started to experience some success. Receiving a 7th loan is not something that all borrowers end up getting to, and that is in it self a great testament to the character and hard work of this group.<p>\r\n\r\nYnes J. is the group representative, and a perfect example to represent this group. Ynes is a very outgoing, hardworking mother to 3 children. She is an extremely loving mother and has done everything in her power to proviD. her children with everything she never had. Ynes has lived in extreme poverty her whole life, and decided a few years back that she wanted to change her future and the future of her family. She received her first loan from Esperanza International and started a small salon from her house. From there she kept working hard and kept increasing the services and products of her salon, and today she has a very successful business. She can finally afford to pay for all of life's basic necessities, and even some luxuries. She has never been happier than she is now, and feels like she can beat poverty. The best part is that she is a testament to her children that they don't have to accept poverty as part of their lives, and can create a better life. Ynes is very excited about the future and is happy with the changes SHE maD. in her life! She is on the right path, and ready to keep increasing her business.<p>\r\n\r\nThank you for your support of Ynes, and the group.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3675,"image":{"id":271209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Todos sus hermanos se fueron a Lima en busca de un mejor porvenir, y le han propuesto irse con ellos, pero \u00e9l prefiere apostar por el arte de labrar la tierra, como \u00e9l llama a la agricultura, ya que le gusta mucho esta actividad. A\u00f1os atr\u00e1s solo sembraba en chacras temporales (regadas por la lluvia), y sus cosechas eran en los meses abril a mayo.

Han pasado m\u00e1s de tres a\u00f1os y por fin est\u00e1 viendo los frutos de su esfuerzo. Ahora sus cosechas son  cada dos o tres veces por a\u00f1o, y cree haber aprendido las t\u00e9cnicas para convertirse en un gran agricultor.

","en":"Nazario is about to turn 30, he is single, and still lives in his mother's house along with his sister.  His other siblings all left for Lima to look for a better future, and have proposed that he go with them, but he prefers to stay and work the land, as he refers to agriculture, since he really likes this activity.  Many years ago he only farmed small plots of land (watered by the rain), and his harvests were in the months of April and May.  But he wanted a change from renting land and changed all the seeds according to the type of land.  More than three years have passed and he is finally seeing the fruit of his labor.  Now his crops are harvested two or three times a year, and he believes he has learned the techniques to become a great farmer.  His upcoming goals are to farm on the coast, since he has a large quantity of seeds especially for  that climate.  In this way he will increase his production which will increase his earnings and make his work a very profitable activity.  Last year Nazario was the president of his community bank, and he completed all his tasks very well.  This is his eighth loan with MFP and in all this time he has shown responsibility in his payments.  The money he is asking for is for buying chemical fertilizers for planting his new coastal crops.  \r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Meinecke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":292722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T18:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nazario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1552.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080275}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T20:43:08Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Meinecke","image":557397}},{"id":101232,"name":"Vun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Vun H., 55, and her husband, Mr. Den Yem, 57, live on an Island in Mekong River about fifteen kilometers from Phnom Penh.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Francisca Zoila is a member of the Hope Communal Bank, which is in the District of Juanjui, Mariscal C\u00e1ceres Province, Department of San Mart\u00edn.  She is 46 years old, single, and the mother of 3 children of whom 2 are still dependents.\r\n<p>\r\nFrancisca has been engaged in sewing for 24 years.  With the help of a little capital, she took the initiative to utilize her sewing skills by opening a dressmaking shop out of her house.  Her business is well suited for welcoming customers, whom she greets with her friendly and charming personality.  \r\n<p>\r\nFrancisca informs us that her business is doing well.  Her customers place their orders in advance.  One of her goals is to open a boutique selling couture fashions and manufacture the garments using modern industrial equipment.  With her loan of 1500 soles, she will purchase a sewing machine and an <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Overlock\" target=\"_blank\" >overlock stitcher<\/a> because her current equipment is in disrepair.  In addition, Francisca will use any leftover money to buy pins, scissors, and paper molds.\r\n<p>\r\nToday Francisca feels she is an accomplished woman and continues to strive for her other dreams. She thanks Manuela Ramos for helping her start her business and supporting many more women who want to grow as entrepreneurs.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":422307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase sewing equipment & materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-11-09T23:10:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca Zoila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:43:03Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835891},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:08:58Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727663},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118118033},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123953757},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:10Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128986876},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:08Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713014}],"funded_date":"2009-11-10T10:23:50Z","paid_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}}]}
