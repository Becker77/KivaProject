Aora Dak village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from Genga borehole. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, meaning that Julia and her family may fall sick and become unable to work or attend school.\n\nJulia works as a subsistence farmer, but has also volunteered her time to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program that enables her community to drink safe water and stay healthy. Julia and four other promoters in her community, including Evalyne, William, Janes and John, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Julia will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. Julia wants to be a promoter because she believes that the dispenser system will kill bacteria in water, preventing waterborne diseases and improving health within the community.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Julia\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1804151,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To provide communities with free access to chlorine to treat their drinking water","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evalyne ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"William ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janes ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2250,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":868290,"name":"Manik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Manik is a 27-year-old woman.

is a self-sacrificing, loving father, 64 years old with eight children, six of whom are independent.  In spite of his age, he continues to fight to get his beloved family ahead and improve their economic situation.  Ever since he was very little, Santos has been around people raising animals, and thanks to this knowledge, he dedicates himself to selling herd animals, work that he learned from his humble parents.  With experience gained over time in the purchase and sales of all herd animals \u2013 cattle, sheep, and alpaca \u2013 he has been able to bring stability to his family.  The desire that Santos harbors in his heart is that of increasing his capital to invest in acquiring more animals. By selling these, he can create more income and pay for the higher education and trade of each of his two younger children. Above all, he hopes to offer a better quality of life for his darling wife Mar\u00eda, who always supports him unconditionally in his daily work.

Halima thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":256021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more clothes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Halima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:22Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436415},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130687},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:53Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027484},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:41Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613485},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010564},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232855},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664659},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:47:31Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105390},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022535},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:59Z","rounded_local_amount":50437.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867784}],"funded_date":"2009-02-02T18:13:44Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Napier","image":null}},{"id":88072,"name":"Muna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Muna H. is thirty years old.

Her stand is located in the Cerro Colorado market (an important market in the city of Juliaca).  It is very busy because of its good location.  She is a charismatic sales person.  She always convinces her customers to take something home.  What she likes best about her business is talking with her neighboring sales people.  That makes the long working hours more amenable.  She has been doing this for 28 years.  The most difficult part is having to stay in her stand all day.

He buys general provisions wholesale and sells to the residents of Sheriff Quarter. He has been running this business for one year and is hoping to improve to a bigger store with branches around town in the future. Abu had been facing some financial problems over the last months with his business but fought hard to maintain it because it is his only means of income. He talks to his customers in a good manner in order encourage them to continue buying from him.\r\n\r\nAbu needs this loan in order to purchase more provisional goods like vegetable oil, bath soap, cigarettes, margarine, etc., to improve business.

She has regular customers and she goes out at dawn and returns home in the afternoon.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":554311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":" To buy potatoes, carrots, corn, broad beans, fruit, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-06-15T19:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:08Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892580},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:55Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632931},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:17Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846965},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:02Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113425},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:52Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407017}],"funded_date":"2010-06-15T21:22:01Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":211830,"name":"Savorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Savorn S. is 36 years old and lives in Damnak village in Takeo province.

She is married to H. F. A., who makes shoe boxes on order. He has contracts with different shoe-making companies. They give him orders and he makes the boxes according to different shoes sizes to make an income. His business is going very well and he is making good profits from it. \r\n\r\nSakina makes and sells bread. She operates a tandoor (a wood-burning over made of mud that is used to make breads on commercial level in Pakistan) and works very hard in the burning heat all the day to earn a living for her family. Her business is also going well. She sells her bread for 5 PKRs and earns almost 100-150 PKRs on daily basis. \r\n\r\nSakina has applied for a loan from Asasah to financially assist her husband, who has large orders to fulfill these days. With the help of the loan, he will buy raw materials that are used to make of shoe boxes, such as hard paper and gum, in large quantities. \r\n<p>\r\nSakina is very confident that her husband will not let her down and that he will make good use of the loan to gain maximum benefits from his business.

With the money he plans to buy more supplies, snacks, and drinks before prices go up in December, which is usually what happens. With his previous loan, he bought more stock at better prices so his profits went up slightly. \r\n\r\nEdgardo\u2019s dream is to expand his store and gradually bring in stationery to sell. This will help him diversify into other areas and bring in new customers. His biggest challenge is having enough working capital. His customers pay their bills every six days, and he pays for his merchandise every 27 days. His profit margin is 23%, and he has a credit capacity of 65%.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":651941,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy more supplies, snacks, and drinks before prices go up","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Galapa-Atl\u00e1ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-11-26T22:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgardo Jos\u00e9","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":72635},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":77179},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":78465},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":79773},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":81103},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82454},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83828},{"due_date":"2011-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":85226},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":86646},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88090},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":89558},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":95043}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.95},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.45},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.15},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.88},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.61},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.11},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.45},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.26},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":39.95,"local_amount":72635,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T23:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":75524.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427715},{"amount":42.45,"local_amount":77179,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":80248.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001137},{"amount":43.15,"local_amount":78465,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:23Z","rounded_local_amount":81585.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289147},{"amount":43.88,"local_amount":79773,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:30Z","rounded_local_amount":82945.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157289},{"amount":44.61,"local_amount":81103,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":84328.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230301},{"amount":45.34,"local_amount":82454,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":85733.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509169},{"amount":46.11,"local_amount":83828,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":87162.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673393},{"amount":244.51,"local_amount":444563,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:47Z","rounded_local_amount":462245.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325134}],"funded_date":"2010-12-21T05:29:07Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":256908,"name":"Roger Jaime","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Roger tiene como actividad la venta de comida atendiendo con el servicio de comida y bebida a una instituci\u00f3n de la ciudad, esta actividad la desarrolla juntamente con su mam\u00e1, esta actividad se constituye en su principal fuente de ingreso para el y su familia.

He was born into a large family with seven children and from childhood was compelled to be healed because of poor health. Unfortunately, his sense of hearing seriously suffered and now he needs to use a hearing device. From early childhood, Konichbek had a propensity to fine arts and gave his first performance in 4th grade. After graduating from college, he became an artist and worked as a layout man. \r\n\r\n<p>In 1980, Konichbek got married and soon became a father of one son and one daughter. His marriage was very happy, but in 1997 tragedy shattered his life - his beloved wife died and he became a single parent, taking care of his children by himself.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Abraham will educate his children and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Khalunyanu A group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph above, Abraham is pictured with his group members.

She dropped out of school after two years of high school to marry her husband Christian Chirinos.  They have a son, 11, and a daughter, 7.  She started out selling \"marcianos\" (a traditional sweet) but because she's always looking for ways to generate more revenue from the business, she jumped in to selling material for building small fishing boats and nets.  With her first 300-soles loan, that she repaid in 4 installments, she bought material for iced marcianos because that's what her customers wanted when she got the loan in the summer.  With this 1000-soles loan, to be repaid in 6 installments, she will invest in nails and wood for building small fishing boats.

This is 35-year-old Husna O. from Mbeya. She is married with four children, between the ages of 5 and 13. Husna has been running a salon since 2005. This is a place where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or plaited, and made to look like your own. <P>\r\n\r\nHusna works at the business for 5-8 hours per day, 7 days per week, and is assisted by her husband. Husna currently earns about 150 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 700 USD in order to purchase salon facilities. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Husna  thanks you for your support!<P>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<P>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. <P>\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":256111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase salon facilities ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-16T20:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Husna S.

The idea for the business came from Kifah, who has good experience in this area and wanted to help her husband to improve the family income. Many people prefer natural herbs over ordinary medicine since they have no side effects. Also, they are cheaper, especially since the GAZA strip is under siege and modern medicine is very expensive. So, Kifah thought of creating this micro business.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe business is primarily managed by Kifah since her husband is employed elsewhere, but he helps her after finishing his work. They asked FATEN for this loan in order to meet the high demand and buy new herbs and oil.

The family has access to electricity, but no piped water, and gets two meals a day. \r\n<p>\r\nTeopista doesn\u2019t incur additional transportation costs to and from shopping, because she buys from people who get what she needs from surrounding villages. She has a small bar where she sells all types of beer and local gin. She sells to all categories of people, at both retail and wholesale prices. Teopista works seven days a week, receiving an average of thirty customers a day. Her major business challenges include thieves and the rainy season which hinders her customers from coming to her because she works from a muddy place. Teopista\u2018s monthly expenses include school fees, rent for her business premises and residence, and feeding the family. \r\n<p>\r\nShe has been in this business for fifteen years and with MCDT for five years, now servicing her twelfth loan and working with the same group mates. Teopista joined MCDT because it was near her home and also to increase her capital. She wants to use this loan to buy more jerrycans of local gin and crates of beer.

Its inhabitants are of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds.  There are elements of the coast, the mountains, and the plains.  This makes for special and harmonious social interactions and productivity among its inhabitants.\n\nJos\u00e9 is 28 years old, and he emigrated to the Turbaco municipality, which is ten kilometers to the east of Cartagena.  He was looking for opportunities for a college education.  In order to follow his dreams he started studying law at the university.  But, the death of his father obliged him to suspend this career because he had to work to support his family.\n\nThat is how he started working at carpentry and bricklaying.  But, these activities did not generate enough income to survive.  Looking back to his heritage, he started making products from the pre-Colombian culture.  He makes things like backpacks, hats, and fabric bags.  \n\nWith his dedication, creativity, and by studying his culture a great deal he created his own work tools for handicrafts.  He made various types of frames and a slide projector.  He uses them to make his products, which are very well received among locals and tourists.  This is because he combines the current tendencies with the pre-Colombian legacy.\n\nJos\u00e9 needs to make headway with the quality of his products because this attracts the most attention.  Therefore, he will use his current loan for the amount of  2,100,000 COP to get a serger (overlock machine) that will improve the quality.  He will also buy materials and supplies like fabric and paint.\n\nJos\u00e9 is a very supportive person, and he often does work to help his family.  He makes small handicrafts and distributes them to stores and hotels in tourist city of Cartagena through a consignment system.  He gets constant weekly orders from businesses in the city of Amurallada.\n\nHis goal is to finish his professional career and to create an interactive handicrafts store where the tourists know and feel the productive process of the articles they are buying.\n\nHe dreams of later exporting his handicrafts and having his own place where he produces what he loves the most, handicrafts from the pre-Colombian culture.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Her husband Romeo, who is 51 years old, works as a tricycle driver. They have nine children between eight and 30. \r\n\r\nNemie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nemie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,500, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 7th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000 to buy hollow blocks, cement, and piglets so that she can start something new and continue to save up for the education of her children. Nemie Ca\u00f1ete is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -- a title of esteem bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her training with CCT as a community partner has enabled her to be successful in business. \r\n<p>\r\nBeing in the direct-sales business, Maribel has developed the skill to choose quality products and deal with people in the neighborhood so as to turn them into regular customers. She sells shirts, pants, bags, shoes, cosmetics, fashion accessories and jewelry that suit the tastes of her friends and business connections. She earns an income by availing herself of discounts from product catalogs and then selling these items at their regular price to her customers. At the end of the month, she is able to earn a minimum net income of around 10,000 PHP.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 27,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this loan to purchase items ordered in advance by her customers. She will also purchase items that are usually ordered by her patrons so that she will be ready to offer them to her clients. By doing this, Maribel believes that she will be able to increase her earning capacity as a micro-entrepreneur.\r\n<p>\r\nSure enough, Maribel does have her share of customers who do not pay on time. Nevertheless, she still prays that she will be able to collect their payments. She dreams of having her house renovated soon and that her business will continue to flourish so she can be of help to her family and relatives. \r\n<p> \r\nAll CCT community partners and clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of fifteen to thirty community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.

receives.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":702440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

He continuously plants 5 hectares of land, where he sows seeds for spinach, carrots and other vegetables. He has 10 years of experience in this field, and what he enjoys most is seeing how his crops grow day by day. He also mentions that in the heaviest harvest times, he contracts laborers so that they can help him finish the harvest, and then he travels to the city of Lima where he sells his produce. Farming is going very well for him, since he has lands near the river, so that he can plant in any season of the year.

She is married and has raised seven children, the youngest of whom is 17 years old. Uulkan's work in animal husbandry is a tradition, since her family has been farming for several generations. Now on her small farm, Uulkan has two cows, fifteen sheep and three horses.

O. is a 33-year-old mother of three children, ages 14, 10, and 7. All are in school and she is married to a police officer. Christine sells charcoal and sometimes makes dresses. She lives next to Nyamasaria slum near a Coptic church. She purchases the charcoal from trucks (lorries) that come around \u2013 bringing it from forests near Masi Mara. <P>\r\n\r\nChristine also owns six houses that she rents out. She hopes to use the loan to expand her business by purchasing more charcoal to sell. Her hopes for the future are for her business to enlarge and to sell out of a kiosk and maybe even a truck. <P>\r\n\r\nIn this video, you can hear me greet Christine saying \"Idhi Nade\" -- which is Luo for \"How are you?\" Christine responds, \"Adhi maber,\" meaning \"very good.\" Most people living in Kisumu descend from the Luo tribe, the same tribe as Obama's father. At the end, you will hear me fluctuate between Kiswahili and Luo saying \"Asante Sana\" in Kiswahili, meaning \"Thank you\" and Erokamano, which in Luo, means \"thank you.\" The voices you hear in the background are coming for a weekly K-MET borrower meeting. To see what one looks like, check out the first video in this blog post: http:\/\/fellowsblog.kiva.org\/2009\/05\/14\/m-banking\/ <P>\r\n\r\nK-MET, the NGO distributing the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional MFI. Rather, it is a development corporation focused on raising health standards in Kenya.

She has been in this business for the past two years and says her major challenge is that there are so many people in the same type of business. Customers are spoilt for choice and are, therefore, not loyal. She is, however, very determined to grow her business and is using her loan to buy more fish.

His future ambition is to sell his animals in the adjacent countries, such as C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and earn a much higher profit.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robert Mouris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":529149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"N'Tjinina ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-04-25T16:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Moussa  ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":102119.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961444},{"amount":208.34,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:08Z","rounded_local_amount":102119.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913456},{"amount":208.33,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":102119.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476597}],"funded_date":"2010-04-29T01:08:28Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robert Mouris","image":538858}},{"id":199573,"name":"Ronald","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ronald M. is from the village of San Jose.

Malakat and her family are IDPs (internally displaced people); they relocated from the city of Fuzuli and now live in the Absheron region. During the time of their flight from the occupied Karabaxa territory, her husband tragically died and she was left alone with two small children. Now, her 19-year-old daughter goes to college and her 17-year-old daughter is in school and also practices dance.

She lives with her 2 children, aged 18 and 20. She has a Chinese food restaurant, a business she began after working for more than 10 years in restaurants, including Chinese restaurants, and learning how to cook. From this, the idea was born to start her own business focusing on Oriental food. Thus the Restaurante Mr. Shing Express was started. She has spent 3 years preparing recipes such as fried rice, sweet and sour pork, shrimp fried rice, chicken with noodles and rice, fish and many delicacies of Oriental cuisine. At this time she has the following financial indexes: profit margin 39.1%,  total debt 12.59%, autonomous 87.41%, the debt with the new loan is 41.67%, the inventory turnover is 5 days and the sales profit is 16.04%.\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. With the previous one, she bought materials and some assets for the business. Her income improved slightly, since she was able to offer different things to her customers and have better sales than before, when she didn't have financing.  With this Kiva loan, she will be able to have improvements on her locale, changing the floors and painting. This will improve her image, since it is nicer for the customers to eat in a place that looks new and sanitary, as Nury Elena is planning. Her dream and challenge is to buy her house, for which she has been saving in a state agency and with it she also hopes to open another locale in her own residence.    \r\n

One of her children lives in her house.\r\n\r\nShe has a kiosk where she sells ceviche and encebollados (seafood soup), dishes which are enjoyed very much by residents of the city and of Ecuador itself.  She prepares and sells these delicious dishes from 6am until 3pm, or until she runs out of food.  She tells us that she has many customers who prefer her because of the seasoning she uses in her food.  Her daughter helps her in the business.  She also sells soft drinks, water, juices, and beer.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to buy fish, yucca, soft drinks, water, beer, and other products she needs for her business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos' worth of cooking oil or an egg. She makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbours and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a 10,000 Philippine peso (PHP) loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nKatlyn hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of giving her child a good future. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Ms. Mariam sells her merchandise retail, for cash or on credit, to a customer base composed essentially of women. \r\n\r\nWith this fourth loan, Ms. Mariam envisions making an average monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to increase her business capital, to help with family expenses, and to cover the interest on her loan.\r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":921165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy condiments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-11-18T03:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":34489.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874361},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:47:48Z","rounded_local_amount":34489.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283183},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:18Z","rounded_local_amount":34489.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424691},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:35Z","rounded_local_amount":34489.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270139958},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":34489.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276756935},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:00:57Z","rounded_local_amount":34489.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251711}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T06:29:24Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T19:00:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":363517,"name":"Jalal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jalal is a 24-year-old Lebanese single man.

She is therefore requesting a loan amounting to Ksh 85,000. Given this loan Marietta will be able to purchase the three brand new computers, a landmark for Marietta since she will be able to provide quick and efficient service.  She will also be training at least one student who wants to be trained in a computer course so that that instead of going all the way to town they will save by training at her place.\r\n\r\nMarietta thanks the Kiva lenders in advance.

The other days of the week she sells from the street near the market.  Although there are various similar food sales, Ana Andrea\u2019s is particularly successful because of the good variety and quality of her food.  Additionally, the majority of the food shops close earlier, but because Ana Andrea stays open until 5 she takes advantage of the opportunity to serve a lot of clients that eat later in the day.\r\n<p>\r\nAna Andrea is requesting this loan to buy more pigs and chickens, which she buys when they are small, fattens them up, and then later uses them for the food she sells.  This is a very economical way to provide her own meat for her food, and she needs more capital to purchase additional animals, food for them, and other things that she uses in preparing her food, such as noodles, vegetables, etc.  Ana Andrea is married and her husband is a farmer, growing corn and beans.  They have seven grown children and ten grandchildren.  Ana Andrea did not have the opportunity to go to school when she was younger and cannot read and write.  Nevertheless, she is very hardworking and has built a very successful business, which she dreams of continuing to expand.

She still continues to support her children\u2019s needs through her business. With the profits of this loan, Regina wants to continue to eat better and purchase some new kitchen utensils.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

Cobra has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Cobra joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cobra has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Cobra is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Cobra from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They live in traditional families.  Their average age is 36; each has at least six children and is a rice farmer.  Hoping to improve the efficiency of their farming operations, the group's members decided to take part in Soro Yiriwaso's loan program.  They have repaid their membership loans, and are now ready for their first business loan.\r\n\r\nAlima C. plans on using her loan to buy rice seed, small tools and fertilizer.  She will get them at the big market in Bla.  Once winter is over, she will use some of what she harvests and keep the rest long enough for the price to rise before selling it at Bla and in other local markets, mostly by selling it directly to customers but also wholesaling it.  Her customers mostly come from large towns.\r\n\r\nAfter she has sold her produce, Alima C. (like other group members) hopes to realize a profit of 45,000 FCFA, to be used to service her loan and to pay for ongoing family expenses. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Michael Briggs, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":562497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy rice seed, fertilizer and small farming tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Djigonso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-07-04T16:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djeneba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Setou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kotimi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noufe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":604136.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917815}],"funded_date":"2010-07-05T03:03:19Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michael Briggs","image":983838}},{"id":215976,"name":"Maritza Maribel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maritza tiene 24 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en Jucuapa del departamento de Usulut\u00e1n, es casada, vive con el esposo y peque\u00f1a hija de 3 a\u00f1os de edad, posee un negocio de venta de tortas y hamburguesas.\nElla inicialmente trabaja como empleada aprendi\u00f3 el negocio y emprendi\u00f3 su propia venta de tortas y hamburguesa, cuanta con dos a\u00f1os de experiencia en el negocio, trabajando en horario de 9:00am-6:00pm, es una persona muy alegre que le gusta hacer bien su trabajo.\nActualmente ella solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para compra de panes, lechuga, carne, mayonesa, salsa de tomate, y otros ingredientes necesarios para la elaboraci\u00f3n de de tortas y hamburguesas, esto contribuir\u00e1 a la continuidad del negocio de Maritza, tener productos para vender.\nLas aspiraciones de martiza son tener un negocio fuerte, atraer clientes, para contribuir a mejorar el sistema de vida de la familia.\n\n","en":"Maritza is 24 years old.

San Jose, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a tricycle transport  business. Her husband Edison, who is 48 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who range from 10 to 25 years old.  \r\n\r\nJohaida joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Johaida has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to purchase one motorcycle with a sidecar so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nJohaida T. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is married, and has four children living with him.  Abd has a falafel restaurant. Falafel is a ball or patty made from ground chickpeas and\/or fava beans. Falafel is usually served in a pita, which acts as a pocket, or wrapped in a flatbread known as lafa. The falafel balls are topped with salads, pickled vegetables, hot sauce, and drizzled with tahini-based sauces. Falafel balls may also be eaten alone as a snack or served as part of a \"meze\".\r\n\r\nGenerally accepted to have first been made in Egypt,where the dish is widely known as \u0637\u0639\u0645\u064a\u0629 (ta'amiya) in Egyptian Arabic, falafel has become a dish eaten throughout the Middle East.The Copts of Egypt claim to have first made the dish as a replacement for meat during Lent. The hearty fritters are now found around the world as a replacement for meat and as a form of street food.\r\n\r\nAbd has been working at preparing and selling falafel since 1985. His customers include community members from his region, in addition to tourists and passers-by. Abd  says that he is passionate about his work and that he could not imagine a life without it, because it introduces him to different populations and  cultures, and it provides his family with a good enough income  to satisfy his family's needs.\r\n\r\nAbd is requesting a loan from Kiva partner Al Majmoua. This will be his eleventh loan from Al Majmoua. In addition to a soft drink refrigerator, he is planning to buy new specialized machine for preparing falafel, necessary to increase his production since his machines are old and not as efficient as they used to be. He says that without the loan, he would not be able to provide the same level of support for his family. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Abd says that he is planning to further expand and improve his business as much as possible."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2000,"image":{"id":768327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

He works as a senior shepherd at a collective farm and watches over a large herd of sheep and goats for all of the village residents, and his own herd is also with him.  He has been involved in fattening up small livestock for over 20 years and always keeps livestock at home because this business is the primary source of income for the rural residents.

Kodirjon is a diligent and tenacious farmer who strives to provide for his family. His wife does not work, so he carries the burden of meeting his family's needs alone through his farming income. He works on a one-hectare farm owned by his parents. His harvests are sometimes not maximized because his cultivation method and seeds are not the best. Better farming supplies, seeds and fertilizer require more capital, which he doesn't have. Kodirjon is relieved that IMON International will help him get the loan he needs to improve his farm. This loan will be used to buy superior seeds, organic fertilizers and pesticides. Kodirjon is waiting for his next harvest, which he hopes will yield better results than his previous harvests. He will use his farming income to support his children\u2019s educational needs, and if there is still some money left, he really hopes to fix his unfinished house.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her story is representative of both her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients, many of whom recently emigrated from Haiti to the DR. Her group is based in the area surrounding La Romana, an agricultural area where the economy focuses around the sugar cane harvest, where running water is unreliable and not potable, and electricity are unreliable at best. Here she makes her home as a single mother with her two children.\r\n\r\nIf you have ever wondered where clothing that the Salvation Army cannot sell ends up, Rosa's business can provide part of the answer.

She is 48 years old and the leader of a 13-member group loan offered by Kiva partner, ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<br>Julieta is married and has four adult-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Julieta has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Julieta joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. Julieta is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be her second from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI<\/b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Since separating from her partner, she was faced with providing food and education to her 3 children.  Now two of them are older and independent, but she still cares for the younger one.\r\n<p>\r\nShe has worked arduously since she was young, so having to care for her children on her own was not very difficult for her.  She was previously a door-to-door saleswoman and with her earnings, she was able to build her own house where she set up a grocery store.  This is how, for the past 8 years, she has been working in her store where she also sells fruits and vegetables, since she earns more with these than with the groceries.  She wakes up at 3am three times per week to go shopping at the wholesale market and purchase fruits and other products.  Oswalda likes selling because it keeps her entertained and she talks with her customers.  Her children also help her sometimes and that comforts her a lot.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her eighth loan with MFP, which confirms her commitment to making her loan repayments on the assigned dates.  It also shows that she works in harmony with her fellow group members.  With this loan that she is requesting, she plans to purchase school supplies and sell them in her store to take advantage of the beginning of school and attract new customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kathleen O&#039;Connell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":493700,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase desk supplies to sell in her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-23T00:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oswalda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":175.71},{"due_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":176.56},{"due_date":"2010-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":186.69},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":193.46},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":203.79},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":210.93},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":222.46},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":230.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.15},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.09},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.52},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.24},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.8},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.95},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":63.15,"local_amount":175.71,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:33Z","rounded_local_amount":181.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993280},{"amount":63.45,"local_amount":176.56,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":182.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718063},{"amount":67.09,"local_amount":186.69,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:11Z","rounded_local_amount":192.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751738},{"amount":69.52,"local_amount":193.46,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":199.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934200},{"amount":73.24,"local_amount":203.79,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:56Z","rounded_local_amount":210.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672975},{"amount":238.55,"local_amount":663.79,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:29Z","rounded_local_amount":685.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153839}],"funded_date":"2010-02-23T05:46:54Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen O'Connell","image":578556}},{"id":183194,"name":"Simon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Simon is a 62-year-old married man in western Kenya, near the town of Kitale.

La variedad de productos que ofrece y el buen trato que brinda hacen que su negocio tenga mucha acogida.\n\nRaquel desea ampliar su negocio con la compra de mercader\u00eda de manera que pueda satisfacer la demanda de sus clientes y tambi\u00e9n obtener mas ingresos que le permitan seguir adelante y apoyar a los gastos de su hogar. Por ello se ha visto en la necesidad de solicitar por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1500 nuevos soles que le ayuden a lograr su objetivo.\n\nElla es una mujer bastante trabajadora y que ha luchado por salir adelante a pesar de su condici\u00f3n de madre soltera, sus vecinos y conocidos le consideran una persona responsable y de confianza.\n\n","en":"Raquel is a 28 year old single mother.  She lives with her two year old son in her parents\u2019 house.  It is located in the Za\u00f1a district, which is 45 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nThe need to get her minor son ahead made her feel the need to start a business, which would allow her to get income to get ahead.  Therefore, two years ago she decided to set up a convenience store in her parents\u2019 house.  \r\n\r\nShe started selling a few products, and thanks to her efforts, the business has been slowly growing.  She currently sells groceries, beauty products, women\u2019s and men\u2019s clothing, soft drinks, and beer, among other things.  The variety of products she sells and the good service she offers make her business very well received.\r\n\r\nRaquel wishes to expand her business by purchasing merchandise so that she can satisfy her customers\u2019 demand.  She also wants to get more earnings that will allow her to get ahead and help with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nThat is why she has seen the need of asking Edpyme Alternativa, for the first time, for a loan for 1,500 PEN.  This will help her achieve her objective.\r\n\r\nShe is a very hard-working woman who has fought to get ahead in spite of being a single mother.  Her neighbors and acquaintances consider her to be a responsible and trustworthy person.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":511440,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy merchandise to expand her convenience store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Za\u00f1a -

Mombasa is the coastal region of Kenya and is well known for its many many tourist attractions, not forgetting the Indian Ocean's white beaches. \r\n\r\nBilliah has been selling such building items as sand, ballast, and coral blocks for the last ten years to the local people. She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is having to work hard to win the hearts of customers since she is in a business which is male dominated. \r\n\r\nBilliah works very hard from early morning to late evening to keep her business doing well. She is using her loan of Kes 40,000 to buy more sand, ballast and coral blocks to meet the demand of her customers. She hopes to be a supplier of her goods in future. She also hopes to own a lorry to help her transport the building materials. She describes herself as very determined. \r\n\r\nBilliah is married to a contractor and a mother of four, aged between seventeen years old and five years

They have four children ages 11, 9, 7, and 3.  They live in their own home in the community of Villa Mar\u00eda Alto Yurinaki, province of Chanchamayo.  Loida farms her own land.  When she joined her life with Pedro, she took on this arduous but rewarding work.  The cultivation of coffee and bananas is going very well and provides her with the possibility of generating savings for emergencies.  \u201cI have five \u2018cuadras\u2019 (a unit of land measurement = roughly 1.5 acres), and I have planted coffee in four of them and bananas in the other one \u201c, she says, pleased with the expanse of her land.  \r\nHer priority is to cultivate coffee to meet the great demand.  However, in order to pay expenses and daily necessities, she has to sell arrobas (a unit of measure equal to 24-36 pounds, depending on the region) of bananas from their crops.  She harvests 15 to 18 sacks of coffee, quite a substantial production!  This business is going very well.  But the process isn\u2019t simple.  The work requires time and dedication so she has to hire laborers for constant cleaning of her crops.  \r\nShe has many plans for the future; the most immediate is to buy a second hand car in order to move easily from their community to the city.  In order to achieve this goal, she will have to work as hard, or even harder than she does now.  This would be the first loan that Loida would obtain thanks to the help of MFP; therefore she accepts responsibility for being punctual with her monthly payments.  \u201cLos Productores Yaneshas\u201d, a part of the communal bank, has just formed and she feels excited about working in groups.
