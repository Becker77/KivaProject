Also, she is happy and extraverted.  She is a widow and all her children have their own families but visit her constantly.  She lives with her nephew and has her own home.\r\n\r\nBetty sews, which she learned by studying at vocational school.  She started her business independently with a sewing machine that she bought with her own money and set up in her house 12 years ago.  At first she did little jobs for her neighbors and friends and with time, her client base grew because of her good work.  What she likes about her job is being able to count on financial income to cover her personal and household expenses, since she is single.  Also, she enjoys what she does and is able to distract herself with this work.  Her future plan is to set up a workshop in her house.  \r\n\r\nThis will be her fourth loan with MFP and she hopes the collaboration will help her reach her goals.  On the other hand, she promises to be prompt with her payments just as she was with previous loans.  In addition to feeling comfortable with the members of her communal bank, she considers them responsible and caring people.  With the loan request of 1000 nuevos soles, she will buy a sewing machine worth 600 soles and fabric and thread for sewing. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":929165,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"buy a sewing machine, fabric, and thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-25T22:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Betty ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":146.2},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":153.05},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":166.86},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":173.09},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":176.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":184.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.39},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.57},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.91},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.26}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.83,"local_amount":146.2,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:00Z","rounded_local_amount":148.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836197},{"amount":57.39,"local_amount":153.05,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":155.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245960},{"amount":62.57,"local_amount":166.86,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:30:54Z","rounded_local_amount":169.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385983},{"amount":64.91,"local_amount":173.09,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:25Z","rounded_local_amount":175.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099073},{"amount":66.04,"local_amount":176.11,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-21T08:25:53Z","rounded_local_amount":178.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713233},{"amount":69.26,"local_amount":184.69,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":187.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202118}],"funded_date":"2011-11-28T03:02:15Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Molly Jones","image":628894}},{"id":367273,"name":"Tunaweza Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mikidadi, who is in his 20's, is married and has one child.

She is a 59 year old widow and mother of five children 45, 40, 35, 30 and 24 years of age. The youngest child still goes to school. Gilda studied up to the fourth grade, but didn't continue due to her parent's lack of financial resources. She lives in her own house in the neighborhood of Luis Cabral in Maputo. In addition to her children she takes care of two grandchildren who live with her. \r\n<p>\r\nShe left Xai Xai  with her parents for Maputo while she was still very young. Later she married and moved to the neighborhood where she currently lives. After the death of her husband who worked for the Mozambique Railways, she received a survivor's pension in the amount of 2714 Meticais. She saves some through the traditional \"Xitique\" savings system. \r\n<p>\r\nShe has already raised seven loans with a credit cooperative (CCOM) to enlarge her house. Following many discussions about credit with her friends, she met Mr. Isaura, an employee of Hluvuku, and decided to request loans from this organization. This is her first loan, in the amount of 25,000 Meticais, with which she intends to purchase construction materials (cement, sand, iron and others) to continue her work. \r\n<p>\r\nShe promises to pay off the current loan in due course in order to take on additional loans in the future with the goal of completing work on her house and starting commercial activities. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br

She is a humble and content person that lives in her own house and hopes to improve the quality of her life. Olivia sells yogurt and juices. She buys her merchandise in a border town with Bolivia and she brings it to the city in order to distribute it to certain shops that have promised to purchase her merchandise. What she likes most about her business is selling her merchandise. She feels like her work is productive. She has been doing this activity for four years. The difficult part of her work is transporting her products, as they are very fragile. With time, she hopes to have a larger store where she can sell greater quantities of her product. This is the first loan that Olivia has requested from MFP and she knows that she has to pay her payments on time. She is happy to be a member of the community bank. She knows the bank is counting on the members to meet their commitments. With the 800 new soles that she is requesting, she will buy more products.

He is forty-five years old. Nelson is the group leader of a seven-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nNelson is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Nelson owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Nelson has been engaged in his business for over six years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP whenever he sells an animal he raised.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nelson joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nelson has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. Nelson is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which he will use to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be Nelson's second loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay for his children's tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-five branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She can generate a better income from the improved business stock. However, she still wants to expand her kiosk by selling basic household needs such as rice, kerosene and gasoline that are not available at her kiosk at the moment. For that reason, she is requesting an individual loan amounting to IDR 3,000,000 from TLM. She definitely believes that loan will help her to improve her business.

She is single and has a daughter.\r\n\r\nShe is both a seamstress and a merchant with a small grocery store that she has been running herself for 13 years.  She began to work at age 20 as a seamstress after learning the trade through a course her father paid for.  In 1993 she began her grocery business with the income she obtained through her sewing.  Her first purchases were a box of soap, sweets and bread.\r\n\r\nIn 1998 she began working with her first loan (C$ 10,000) which she used to buy display cases, counters and products.  Most of her customers are workers at the tobacco factory across the street from her store.  She has always kept up with her seamstress business while never interrupting her grocery activity.\r\n\r\nShe plans to use the loan to buy two packages of clothing as well as oil, rice, sugar and other products.  She plans to buy them wholesale to get better prices.  This loan will help her increase sales since she has many requests for products.\r\n\r\nHer plan is to expand her grocery and stock it with a variety of products.

This is their sixth loan with ALIDE, and they have agreed to support each other in their businesses and loan repayments.\r\n\r\nPhilomene (with her hand raised in the photo) is 56 years old.

She is 45 years old. Belinda is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Belinda F. Group.\r\n\r\nBelinda is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Belinda owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Belinda has been engaged in her business for more than 20 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Belinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Belinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Belinda is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Belinda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Rachael is 20 years old and lives in the town of Zana in central Uganda.  She is married and has two children and one of her children is currently in school.  Rachael has had a clothes-washing business for two years.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Rachael has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan shillings from Kiva field partner BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase an iron box and more basins to make doing laundry easier.  With the help of this loan from BRAC, Rachael hopes to generate greater profits and buy new clothes for herself.  In the future, Rachael hopes to own a retail shop. Rachael is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which may help her prospects for the future by teaching her how to save money.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Samson will educate his children and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Daraja Mawe Farmers group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph above, Samson is pictured with his group members.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":918450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-21T07:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wycliffe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evans","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joseph","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Bernard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":92750,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":92750,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":93900,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680831}],"funded_date":"2011-12-23T03:24:18Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":363193,"name":"Rey Mariano","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rey Mariano is single.

He failed to go to school because of his family\u2019s extreme poverty. He learnt to take charge of himself very early, but in pitiful conditions. As an illiterate, he took a wife very early and now, he is father of five (05) children, which made his situation and that of his family difficult and increased the poverty. Clairvoyant and full of initiative, he is involved in the sale of cheap medicines from Nigeria (a West African country). They are obviously not the best kind of  medicines available, but very appreciated by the majority of the population, because they are cheap as compared to pharmaceutical products of good quality but expensive for poor people. Advised and directed to cheap generic products, Mr Felix A. did his test with his first credit of $ 200 that was well paid back.\r\n\r\nHealth being life, Mr Felix A. understood the need of a more adequate storage location for medical security. That is why he would like to have this credit of $850 which will help him rent a little store and improve the quality of his stock by the supply of generic products conform with international standards and help save human lives.\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMonsieur A.

G. lives in the Rudaki region of Tajikistan.  He sells fruits and vegetables for a living. Since the Rudaki region is close to Dushanbe, capital of Tajikistan, Gulom can make a good profit by bringing the produce from faraway regions where it can be purchased for a low price. He then sells the produce at  Dushanbe markets. Gulom wants to take out this loan to expand the amount of goods he is able to offer at his market stall. He is planning to pay back the loan in the next 10 months. Gulom lives with his young wife and parents and is the main bread winner for the family.

She started this business because she worked in a small shop by her husband\u2019s side (he does the same work),  and they decided to have something of their own.

They also make custom shoes.

They can still remember the time when they were making \u201cbalut\u201d(egg delicacy) themselves, never worrying about the risk of biking at night, to sell their eggs for income for their family. Every day, they toil away because they like to earn enough to have savings to add to their capital. They also ensure good quality of their product and services to please their customers and sustain their business. Their experiences are really a mixture of perseverance, hard work and prayer that they continuously do until today.<P>\r\n\r\nPresently, the couple are the proprietors of the largest \u201cBalut\u201d and hatchery business in Sto. Nino, South Cotabato, Mindanao. \u201c Balut\u201d is a very popular delicacy in the Philippines. It is made of duck and chicken eggs. Making the eggs as their business, the couple is sure that they will have a stable income their family will enjoy. <P>\r\n\r\nAiming for business growth to support their child's education, the couple finally joined the credit program of Community Economic Ventures, Inc.  Their participation in the program was an opportunity to learn about savings and business management. During cluster meetings, they were able to market and talk about their product to other entrepreneurs who were also accessing  CEVI credit services. The couple markets their eggs as well as their ducklings, always for sale.<P>\r\n\r\nOver years of business development, their loan of Php 4,000 from CEVI has gone far in acquiring business assets.  Seventy percent of their income is reinvested in the business and the rest goes to savings.<P>\r\n\r\n\u201cSome of our competitors have tried destroying us as well as our business.  They are after our regular customers. Good that they never succeeded. God has helped us survive and stay in the market for so many years now. We are doing our best to make our business grow even more. In that way we would be able to employ more people in our business,\u201d they said.\r\n\r\nThe business has now reached Davao and General Santos (still part of Mindanao). They opened an outlet in these cities, hoping that more and more \u201cBalut vendors\u201d will be able to benefit from their high quality but less expensive eggs. Surprisingly, their business has turned everyone on to sell eggs in the streets to have a livelihood for their children. <P>\r\n\r\nAside from the hatchery business, they have now started distributing fashion products. This business also helps them supplement their income. They hope that like their hatchery business, their engagement in fashion retail will also be a success.<P>\r\n\r\n Until now, the couple continues to access loans through the CEVI credit program.  They like the services of CEVI because they also teach people with businesses moral standards and Christian faith. The couple believes in God, who is the center of their business success. They believe that God will always bless the works of the faithful. And with all accomplishments and compliments they receive, they will remain humble and continue to help their community, especially those who seek their aid.<P>\r\n\r\nHaving learned about KIVA from CEVI, Michelle E. would like to borrow Php 25,000. She will use the loan to improve their business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":357981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The funds requested will be used to buy a young heifer which she will fatten for three months to sell later at a higher price.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":436665,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy a cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-28T02:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:20Z","rounded_local_amount":83.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734865},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:13Z","rounded_local_amount":83.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124189},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:43Z","rounded_local_amount":83.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959930},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:32Z","rounded_local_amount":83.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992774},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":83.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717562},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":85.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751240}],"funded_date":"2009-11-28T03:13:47Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":161777,"name":"Amelia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amelia is 48 years old and lives in the island of Binangonan, an attractive province of Rizal. She and her husband have three children. Judy Ann, 12 years old, is a high school student. Jeremie, 11 years old, and Jericho, 9 years old, are both in elementary grades. She is married to Hilario, a 52-year-old construction worker (laborer) and a supportive husband.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, she joined ASHI (Ahon SA Hirap Inc.) a microfinance institution and KIVA field partner in the Philippines. Amelia makes and sells food. She has been in business for more than 10 years. She believes that her proposed loan of Php 20,000.00 will be a big help and will contribute to the growth of her business. She will use all of the loans funds to buy rice, sugar, and an electric coconut grinder for her business. She will also start raising hogs for additional income.  \r\n\r\nAmelia dreams of sending her children to school and hopes that will complete a degree in college. She believes that poor families need support so that they can change their standard of living and build beautiful houses for their families to live. When she joined ASHI, she had only a \"bahay kubo\" (a small house made of bamboo) but with the benefit of loans and the support of ASHI in their lives, their small house of bamboo has become big one made of hollow blocks. Half of her dreams have been gradually achieved, but she is still dreaming about completing them. Amelia is a positive and optimistic mother who knows that she will overcome all challenges and achieve her dreams.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":448090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

and married to Jos\u00e9, who is also 28.  She is an earnest woman who lives in her own home with her two active children, Roselin (age 11) and Anthony (age 2).  For the past four years, she has been selling food products with the help of her husband and daughter.  Each day is a constant struggle that requires great sacrifice because she keeps her store open 24 hours a day in order to earn the most income possible.  Her business is located near a bridge where cars pass through the area.  People stop to buy cold drinks in order to deal with the heat of the Peruvian jungle.  What she enjoys most about her job is making friends with her customers, who return to make more purchases because of the good service they receive.  Jhudy says selling her products is profitable and allows her to contribute to the household expenses.  In addition, she is setting aside money to buy land so that she can have enough space to expand her business.  Her dream is to become a wholesale distributor of food products.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.  Jhudy knows that in order to make progress, she must make her payments on time.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Manab\u00ed province.  This is a small place surrounded by a lot of vegetation.  Its residents perform different occupations: such as merchants, and factory employees.\r\n\r\nMiriam has been a member for 37 loan cycles, so we know a lot about her.  She is married with 2 children, and is currently expecting her third. She does very well in the group, and in the months that she has been pregnant her mother-in-law has been helping her to sell.  \r\n\r\nMiriam sells Avon products and clothing for men, women and children.  She has always invested everything she has borrowed from the Foundation, but in the winter season she invests little because during these months she earns very little.  Using the Avon catalog she offers products to her customers through advance orders.  To obtain her clothing, her husband travels to the city of Guayaquil to buy from the wholesalers.  She has been working in sales for 3 years, and she does it in an informal manner, visiting her customers door-to-door.  She sells during the weekends.  She will invest all of the proceeds of this new loan so that she will have products for the months when sales are high, and so that she can fill orders that she has for products such as pants and perfumes.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":528572,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy clothing for women, men and children, and Avon brand perfumes  ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-04-24T19:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirian Aydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25},{"due_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":96.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.87},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":290.63,"local_amount":288.75,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:02Z","rounded_local_amount":290.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709064},{"amount":193.75,"local_amount":192.5,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:52Z","rounded_local_amount":193.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892363},{"amount":290.62,"local_amount":288.75,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":290.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632728}],"funded_date":"2010-04-25T19:22:13Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":199265,"name":"Angelica Pedro","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":"\nAng\u00e9lica Pedro N. nasceu no Distrito de Chibuto, Prov\u00edncia de Gaza, sul de Mo\u00e7ambique tem 39 anos de idade, vi\u00fava e m\u00e3e de 6 filhos de 18, 16, 14, 12, 10 e 06 anos de idade, todos v\u00e3o a escola.

She is asking for 12,000 meticais, which she will use to buy bundles of assorted used clothing to increase her inventory.  The previous loans were for 3,000 meticais and 5,000 meticais, and both were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nAng\u00e9lica promises to pay off this loan on time in order to take out other loans.

Bernard, his wife, Charlene, and his six boys were separated during the extreme chaos the city experienced during the storm\u2019s immediate aftermath. Charlene and the boys evacuated on a truck reserved for women and children with Texas as its general destination while Bernard made his way to the closest airport. Among the many long lines of people going to different cities, Bernard chose to go to San Antonio because he had heard its mayor, Phil Hardberger, announce on CNN that the city had sufficient resources to take care of Hurricane Katrina evacuees. Because the cell phone towers had shut down, Bernard and Charlene had a difficult time getting in touch with each other. After two weeks, Bernard learned from his mother that Charlene and the boys were in the Astrodome in Houston. Bernard went to Houston, found his family, and took them back to San Antonio. The Bayou Baglery had been forced to close and Bernard did not have a job or home to return to in New Orleans. The McGraws decided to set down their roots in San Antonio and Bernard found a run-down shack on the Southside of town and set up a kitchen with a hot plate, a refrigerator, and a deep fryer from the flea market, and tables and chairs from Wal-mart. Soon after, Bernard realized that his make-shift restaurant needed to make several changes in order to meet permit standards. Also, in that short amount of time, Bernard developed an incredibly loyal and gracious clientele from the close-by military base. They raised money at the base to help Bernard make all the required repairs and to obtain various permits and licenses. Since 2007, Bernard\u2019s Creole Kitchen has won the San Antonio Critic\u2019s Choice Award, the Blue Plate Award and the Talk of the Town Award. \r\n\r\nBernard studies Biblical Theology at the Baptist University of the Americas and has been asked by them to open his kitchen in their dining area. There will be a lunch line for a guaranteed amount of 85 students a day (plus additional students without meal plans who will pay cash) and a restaurant with a seating area for his regular customers. With this loan, Bernard plans to stock the restaurant with enough supplies to handle the increased amount of customers. Supplies will include food, new menus, salt and pepper shakers, a new register system, and a safe. \r\n\r\nIn addition to going to school and managing his restaurant, Bernard still makes time to give back. Five years ago, he started a program called \u201cGumbo Under the Bridge\u201d feeding homeless people. He says, \u201cAfter being homeless, you never judge a homeless person again.\u201d Last year, he also started a job-start program that he participated in at his own high school where students work at large companies and learn how to fill out job applications and to dress and act in a professional manner.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4275,"image":{"id":621896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"New

Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb (20209050045) is a 29-year-old female living in the town of Huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has 2 school-aged children.  To making a living, T. owns & operates a business venture raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale.  T. has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3.800.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  T. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.600.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies.  T. is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to build shelter for the borrower's livestock.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business.\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.

With her years in business, she felt that she needed to increase her production in order for her to earn a good profit, but her problem was that she did not have enough equipment. \r\n<p>\r\nShe joined SPBD and borrowed US$300 which she used to buy the biggest pot she could find for cooking her pork buns, and also a gas stove to replace the old kerosene stove that she didn\u2019t like because it gave her buns a kerosene smell. She is now very happy with the improvements to her business and is now looking at expanding it by making banana chips to go together with her pork buns. \r\n<p>\r\nRosi sells her products at their village primary school five days a week, and she is very favored by the students because she\u2019s a very funny lady. She explained it\u2019s her personality that\u2019s marketing her business. She\u2019s a sixty-year-old mother of three grown-up children, and her husband is an engineer. She is a very active lady who is willing to stay longer in the program."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":65158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Telesia joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Telesia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Telesia S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.6 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She currently stays at home to take care of the kids and help them do their homework. The family's income is contributed by Dul T.\u2019s husband who appears in the photo. He is a construction foreman. He has a few employees to help him provide this service and he earns at least $8 a day.

","en":"Telica, one of the principal municipalities of the city of Leon, where the streets are made of cobblestone, the houses of adobe, and the roofs of tile, is precisely where Edgar is from. He is a simple but hardworking businessman, 40 years old, a father of a family, and married. He has three children who are 18, 17, and 6 years old. The oldest of his children is taking the first year of an accounting course. His second child is in the third year of high school and his youngest child attends kindergarten. His wife is a housewife but she helps him with his retail clothing business.\r\n\r\nEdgar rents a small place near the town church where he sells clothing for children, juniors, and adults, including pants, blouses, shorts, and men's shirts. Every day he leaves his home carrying all his merchandise to fit it all into his humble carts and begin to sell--to be able to gather his strength and supply for the needs of his family. He tells us that he started this business three years ago with some savings he had, as before that he worked in the city's mayor's office and also worked for different companies. But the scarcity of work became intense and he couldn't get a formal job so he decided to start his own business when he saw very few possibilities of getting work. The needs of his family couldn't wait, and thank God it has gone well for him and this is how he earns a living and gets his children ahead.\r\n\r\nHe needs the loan to buy new clothing such as shirts, men's and women's jeans, blouses, girdles, t-shirts, and trousers. The Christmas season is coming and he wants to take advantage to sell all of his merchandise, in this way improving his sales to pay off his debt and invest in buying mannequins, display cases, and more variety of merchandise to sell. In the future he would like to have his own place to create a clothing store and hire people to help him sell."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":920498,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy new clothes such as shirts, men's and women's jeans, blouses, girdles, t-shirts, and trousers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2011-11-18T19:50:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar Francisco\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":333.34,"local_amount":333.34,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:47:44Z","rounded_local_amount":333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250832707},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:16:06Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257242629},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:42Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263381900}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T23:56:59Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tamara Hellgren","image":null}},{"id":363225,"name":"Fe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fe is 52 years old and lives in the Philippines.

This allows him to earn up to 30 soles a day, and on a good day he can earn up to 50 soles, which helps him with additional household expenses.  He believes his business is doing well because he does a good job and, thanks to this, his customers recommend his service to others.\r\n<p>\r\nHe is infinitely thankful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their support, he is going to be able to buy 2 electric machines.

She is an active member of Queen Esther Group and has benefited a lot from the group through loans she has been getting. Her first loan from KIVA of USD 300 enabled her to install electricity in her rental rooms. This lead to increment of monthly charges from USD 7 to USD10. She was also able to install power in her house which made a significant change in her life. Her family was touched by the loan because since she got married she had not seen electricity in her house. The whole family was touched by the loan and their living standard changed abit. Her grandchildren work as a team and they grow varieties of vegetables for sale and they help her in loan repayment. She supports the children with the income she get from rental rooms and she has housed them. She believes knowledge is power, thus it\u2019s her responsibility to pay fees for her grandchildren as their father is not bothered.

Annamary M. is a 52-year-old widow with four children. Her children are between the ages of 19 and 34 years old. In 2004 Annamary established a bar and she now seeks a loan in order to purchase additional stocks of beer, liquor, and soft drinks. Undoubtedly, Coca Cola\u00ae is one of the most recognized symbols or 'words\" in the world. Even in the most remote villages in Africa, there is usually some kind of \"bar\" selling Coke, Fanta, and Guinness; Annamary notes that Pepsi has made it to most African capitals but not to the less-populated areas, but she is sure that Pepsi is working on expanding into those areas too!). The hot weather makes soft drinks all the more appealing, which explains why selling soft drinks is such a popular venture regardless of whether you\u2019re the CEO of Coca Cola Ltd. in the United States or a micro-entrepreneur in Tanzania!\r\n\r\nAbout SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facilities as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services. SELFINA thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":123260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

Her general store has been in business for three years. She noticed that this business was a good opportunity for her because there is a bus stop for a transportation company near her house, and the drivers are always looking for food to eat throughout the day. Thus, Adelaida and her husband decided to put their savings together and open a general store. It started out with only a few goods, but as time went by, it has grown. Adelaida would like to keep expanding her business because it contributes to the education of her children\u2014the most important people in her life. The problem she is currently facing is that the road on which both her house and the bus stop is located is being repaired, but when the road work is finished, the drivers will once again come through there. This is the first time that Adelaida requests a loan from MFP. She was invited to join her microfinance institute because her desire for self-improvement and her responsibility in managing her finances are evident. She will invest this loan in purchasing more goods for her general store. She will purchase yogurt and other drinks in wholesale bulk, which cost 50.00 PEN each, as well as sacks of legumes, rice and sugar, among other products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":255419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-15T08:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adelaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:09:44Z","rounded_local_amount":168.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228391},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:09Z","rounded_local_amount":168.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423626},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":168.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116894},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:52Z","rounded_local_amount":168.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011816},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:34Z","rounded_local_amount":168.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595409},{"amount":53.62,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989650}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T12:15:43Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":87828,"name":"Salvador","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1or Salvador A. acaba de adquirir su vivienda por medio de un cr\u00e9dito gubernamental.

She is married with 4 children and lives in a rural area where there are no jobs. Her main sources of income are agriculture and the remittances that her elder son sends from Russia. However, due to the economic crisis, for the past two months he has not sent any money. Mahabbat sold a bull and was planning to buy a dairy cow but then she realized that keeping a cow would be even more expensive. Therefore she came to Microinvest to inquire about the conditions of the loan. Having received the loan, she bought a cow. Now she already owns several dairy cows.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste, in the local community. Elvie has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Elvie joined Kiva partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elvie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This loan was used to invest in expanding her business. Elvie is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her second from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

P. is 24 years old and resides in San Pedro Perulapan in Cuscatl\u00e1n. William lives with his wife and owns a bakery, having approximately four years experience. William puts all his efforts towards producing bread seven days a week, for which he's well known. He provides bread to many shops in his area but, unfortunately, his production is coming up short each time when compared with the demand that he has. It is for this that he is requesting this loan to buy a new oven that will allow him to produce more bread.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Folo has many years of experience in this business.  Folo needs a loan of WST $1500 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Folo joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Folo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Folo M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

This loan will be the second loan taken out by Emily from PMPC.

Her previous loan of PHP15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.

Her business is the traditional one of making all types of clothing, but mostly school uniforms and outfits for women, and pants.  Since 1995 when she began the business with her daughter with 10 sewing machines and her son-in-law who was in charge of marketing strategy, she has succeeded in getting a lot of business from customers.  For 5 years the results of this business were very good, but her daughter lost her husband  and Maria Cristina couldn't continue working the same way because her daughter got involved in other things, so her sales dropped.\r\n\r\nMaria Cristina has an overlock sewing machine and an industrial machine, and although she handles contracts with businesses and department stores, her market is more domestic with the making of uniforms, multiuse clothing and items taken on order.\r\n\r\nHer goal for the future is to expand the market and generate higher earnings, although her big problem is insufficient working capital to make it happen.

Maksudakhon works at a local school and is known as a principled and demanding teacher.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a teacher's salary is not high, so Maksudakhon decided in parallel with her main work to do a trade business. Using a sum of 20,000 Kyrgyz Som (KGS) as starting capital, Maksudakhon made every effort to develop the activities -- she harvest and purchases apples from the local population for resale. For these purposes, a specially sealed barn was built, where fruits are stored at a certain temperature and a car was purchased for transportation to the local market. This allows Maksudakhon to earn a monthly profit of 20,000 som. \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0445\u043e\u043d contacted the company Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy five tons of apples. Procurement of these goods will allow her to expand the number of customers and increase sales. In the future, Maksudakhon plans to build a large warehouse for storage of fruit."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":929350,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fruits for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Nookat town","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-28T18:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maksudakhon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:14:31Z","rounded_local_amount":50170.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276816161},{"amount":1075,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":50170.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283072186}],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T14:46:46Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T11:07:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":367337,"name":"Everline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Everline is a married woman with 3 children, 2 of whom attend school while 1 is still too young for school.

She has two children between the ages of 15 and 17 whom she loves much too much.  They are now in the fifth year of secondary school, and Rosy is very proud of them.  Her husband, a miner, lives with her.  He supports her a lot, and he is her right hand in everything.\r\n\r\nRosy lives in Caman\u00e1, an oasis on the other side of the long and dry Sechura desert, which dominates the coast in the southeastern part of Peru. Caman\u00e1 has historically been an important tourist destination in Peru. Nevertheless, the frequent and strong earthquakes and tsunamis in the past decade (an 8.4 in 2001 and an 8.0 in 2007) decimated the city, destroying the tourist industry in Caman\u00e1 and costing many of the residents their jobs.\r\n\r\nThe result of unemployment is that it creates an atmosphere that is ready for microfinance.  Its beaches, which are beautiful, are Caman\u00e1\u2019s most striking feature.  As it is well-known, Per\u00fa is known for having the most delicious food in the world.  One of the dishes that Rosy likes a lot is \u201cPescado Frito\u201d (fried fish).\r\n\r\nRosy only went to school until the fourth year of secondary school because her parents did not have adequate finances.  However, she would have liked to study cosmetology.\r\n\r\nRosy sells groceries.  She devotes about ten hours a day to her business, waiting on an average of approximately 40 people.  In one day she is able to earn up to 50 soles.  However on a very good day she is able to earn 60 soles.  This helps her with the additional household expenses.  She believes that her business is going well for her thanks to her friendly treatment of the customers and because she offers good quality products.\r\n\r\nShe is currently more than pleased with the Kiva lenders.  Thanks to the support they have given her she will be able to buy more products to offer in her business.  Because it is the Christmas season she will buy Christmas products to offer her customers.  She will have a much greater variety, and this will improve her business.  That will give her more income and improve her quality of life.

Y por si no fuera poco ella ayuda a su esposo en la venta del restaurant que tienen solo los fines de semana, este esfuerzo les est\u00e1 permitiendo salir adelante.\n\nUna de las debilidades que afronta actualmente Graciela es que no cuenta con un monto de dinero considerable para por generar la compra al por mayor de algunos abarrotes como  arroz, aceite, az\u00facar, gaseosas, dulces, etc. es por eso que desea que los prestatarios Kiva puedan ayudarla con un pr\u00e9stamo de S\/.1,000.00 y as\u00ed ella pueda comprar los abarrotes que necesita a un precio muy c\u00f3modo. Sabe que si ella hace buen uso del dinero podr\u00e1 llegar a su meta, la misma que consiste en que su hija contin\u00fae estudiando y tener una nueva y mejor bodega.\n","en":"Graciela is a 51-year-old woman who has six children.  She currently lives just with her youngest 11-year-old because all her other daughters are adults living independently.  She is a hardworking woman who very much wants to get ahead and see her young daughter become a good professional.  Her husband, who is a merchant at a restaurant located near the beach in the city of Mala, gives her unconditional support.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Graciela works on average 12 hours a day hoping to generate the necessary income for the home and to buy new and better products.  Her daughter helps her every day.  Graciela believes that the main reason why she has so many customers is the charisma and good humor her daughter has while helping her in the grocery store they have.  This business allows her to earn a daily income of 50 soles but if there is a lot of public she can earn up to 80 soles.  This profit is attained because she tends to an average of 12 customers daily.  If that weren\u2019t enough, she helps her husband with the sales in the restaurant which they only have on weekends.  This effort has made it possible for them to get ahead.\r\n\r\nOne of the weaknesses Graciela faces currently is that she does not have a considerable amount of capital available to be able to buy supplies like rice, oil, sugar, soft-drinks, candy, etc. at wholesale and this is why she\u2019d like Kiva lenders to help her with a loan of 1,000 soles so that she can buy the groceries she needs at a more comfortable price.  She knows that if she makes good use of the money she\u2019ll reach her goal which is that he daughter continues going to school and to have a new and better store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":978555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy stock merchandise for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-01-13T19:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":67.03},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":71.85},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":72.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":75.94},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":77.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":81.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":86.98},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":90.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":93.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":97.45},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":100.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.14},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.94},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.48},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.18},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.43},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.62},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.02},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.13},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.14,"local_amount":67.03,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:23Z","rounded_local_amount":67.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271195},{"amount":26.94,"local_amount":71.85,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":72.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269993845},{"amount":322.92,"local_amount":861.12,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:58:29Z","rounded_local_amount":869.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276601751}],"funded_date":"2012-01-18T01:04:46Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T08:58:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":383726,"name":"G.s.

Hawa thanks you for your support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normA. make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typicA. receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specificA., when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. As such, one of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239655,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To expand her business by purchasing additional women's cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T22:50:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:46Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436341},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130613},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027410},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613411},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010491},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232788},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664604},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105335},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:24:39Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022480},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867730}],"funded_date":"2008-12-17T15:17:17Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Craig Kaufman","image":null}},{"id":83748,"name":"Antonia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Antonia is a member of the Suni (\u201cStrength\u201d in Quechua) Village Bank.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, selling ice-cakes (flavored ice in styrofoam cups).  Leutogi  has 2 years of experience in this business.  Leutogi  needs a loan of WST $1250 to buy sugar, styrofoam cups, and codial (flavoring).  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Leutogi  joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Leutogi 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Leutogi  A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He buys his phones from a Nigerian wholesaler, and says that one day he'd like to be able to import phones from China himself and sell them wholesale.\r\n\r\nAdolphus is 32 years old and married.

Thanks to his wide experience in cultivating vegetables, he was able to open a selling point at the local market, which became known for its high quality products. With the starting capital of 5,000 KGS, he managed to earn about 15,000 KGS in a month.\r\n\r\nNow Baktybek has applied for a loan of 50,000 KGS to broaden the assortment of goods by purchasing garlic and cucumbers.

She lives with Nilton, her partner of 12 years.  They have two daughters, Tatiana and Jocelyn. She started farming at an early age, since \"agriculture\" is the main economic activity in the area.  But for the last 12 years, she and her husband have been farming coffee, avocados, and bananas independently. Every morning, they drive to their fields, where they clean, plant, and harvest their crops.  When the crops are ready, they sell them to Alicia, who has a depot in the area.  From there, their fruit is taken around the country.   What they like about the work is that they can be together as a family for most of the day.  But they hate seeing their crops ruined by the weather.  At the moment, they have begun the coffee harvest; they will use the money they get to improve their home and thereby give their children a better quality of life.  \r\n\r\nElsa is a member of the \"Flor de caf\u00e9\" community bank, and this is her third loan with MFP.  She promises to pay her installments on time, as she has always done before.  She is glad to be part of the community bank because all the members are responsible and very friendly people,  She will use the loan to buy bags of organic fertilizer to spread around her coffee plants and \"island\"-variety bananas.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":788369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy bags of organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-13T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2020.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098484}],"funded_date":"2011-06-13T21:39:12Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ross Forman","image":1172721}},{"id":309951,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan is married and is 47 years old.

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":825141,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a young cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-07-29T17:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.36,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nirmala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-19T08:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227594796},{"amount":75,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":5259,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238691536},{"amount":36.77,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.73,"payment_id":244647901},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-29T09:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865033},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275018},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416484},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-25T08:04:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270131285},{"amount":36.65,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-26T08:27:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.85,"payment_id":276947086},{"amount":106.72,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-26T08:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":7888.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.78,"payment_id":283296478}],"funded_date":"2011-07-29T21:45:41Z","paid_date":"2012-06-26T08:09:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":326345,"name":"Rufina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Rufina se dedica a la venta de comida espec\u00edficamente sopa de pescado y su esposo trabaja como ayudante de alba\u00f1il.

Maria saw a great opportunity in her community to open a phone center, where the locals could go to her phone booths and make calls. This is a particularly good business in these sectors of Guayaquil because people cannot afford to install phone lines in their homes. Therefore, these phone call centers are very popular throughout Guayaquil, especially because they also offer the ability to make international calls to family members who are overseas which can be very expensive, even for those who do have phone lines. <\/p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Maria\u2019s husband has been extremely supportive in this new venture. They slowly accumulated their savings in order to buy the substantial start up investments necessary to launch this business. Maria now wants to put in two computers that have internet connections. Before she can do this she has to add a gate to her entrance and put in an alarm system in order to deter criminals from robbing her. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maria has four children, one of which works at the business at night.

His wife only draws a meager income from her work.  In his household are three people, including two children, all of whom are his responsibility.  Educated through secondary school, he farms as his principal business activity, something he had formal training in.  And it has done the trick for him financially.  But the soil is poor, and it must be  fertilized and otherwise treated.  This requires money he does not have.  And so he is requesting a loan of $950 to stock fertilizer for a successful harvest.  The income will allow him to take better care of his children's health, nourishment, and schooling.  \r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nN\u00e9 en 1962, Monsieur M.
