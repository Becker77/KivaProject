Her teacher\u2019s salary was far less than sufficient, even for basic survival. She believed that there had to be another way of life, a more deserving one. Gulnara made a choice toward improving her life even though she knew that it would require some sacrifice. \r\n<p>\r\nSeven years ago she convinced her husband to sell their car. She invested the proceeds, about $1050, into setting up a business. She started trading in foodstuffs (candies, biscuits, canned food and cereals) in her own stall at a city market. Her family's quality of life has indeed improved. She is making $350 a month, which is one-third of the car\u2019s selling price. Besides being able to pay for their children\u2019s education, they have been able to buy a car, to open another shop near their house, and to put a refrigerator, a freezer and a rack in the shop . \r\n<p>\r\nGulnara has three children. Her husband still works at the school. Her son, 19, works as an electrician. Another son goes to a law school. Their daughter, 14, goes to school, and after school she substitutes for her mother. \r\n<p>\r\nGulnara wants to obtain a loan to purchase cereals, candies and vegetable oil, and to buy some winter clothes for winter trade.  She is making plans about expanding her shop and making changes to attract more customers. \r\n\r\nGulnara\u2019s partners are: Gulnura, Shaiymkul, Anarkan and Gulnara.\r\nGulnura, 36, has two children. Her husband is a welder and Gulnura helps him support the family by selling milk. Gulnura needs a loan to purchase two sheep and a calf and to put up new gates. \r\n\r\nShaiymkul, 58, is a farmer\u2019s wife. They have three children. Shaiymkul keeps some cattle and sells milk. Shaiymkul hopes to obtain a loan and buy a calf and with the rest of the loan harvest the clover. \r\n\r\nAnarkan, 46, has four children. She is a housewife and sells milk. Anarkan needs a loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\nGulnara, 46, has two children. Currently she is busy harvesting crops: clover, corn, pumpkin and sugar beets. She needs a loan to buy a calf.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She is 46 years old. Elsa is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Elsa owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes  from selling vegetables in the local community. Elsa has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2010, Elsa joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elsa is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase more vegetables to sell and as working capital. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Elsa from HSPFI.

She is 37 years old and married with four school-aged children. Lorna owns and operates a business planting and harvesting rice for sale. Lorna has been engaged in farming for over 10 years and also raises hogs. She was able to open a sari-sari store from her income selling products like vinegar, sugar and others.\r\n\r\nLorna joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI and is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Lorna from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

She contacted her neighbors and friends to form a group in her area.\r\n\r\nThe committee is called 'Brisa del Este'.  It is in its 7th loan cycle and has 15 members.  This is a group that stands out in the neighborhood because it is united and responsible.  The members have a great enterprising spirit and are up to date with their loan repayments.  They work together in their activities to make funds which can safeguard the committee if necessary.  They plan to end this stage by fulfilling their duties to the institution.\r\n\r\nThe group's president is Felicia who sells clothes.  She says that she is in a very competitive area because there are many businesses and offers.  It is often very difficult to sell her merchandise.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":" Shodigul S. lives in the Huroson District. She is 49 years old. Her family is very large; she is married and has eight children. For the past seven years she has been raising livestock. She finishes - buys, fattens, and resells - cattle. Now she wants to increase the number of animals by buying a pure-bred bull calf. To do that she decided to take out an 18-month loan. This will improve her business and help her to further develop it.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva

Kholmamad has raised cattle and farmed for 11 years. With two children and the responsibility of providing food for his home, has been able to improve his family\u2019s financial situation thanks to the excellent care that he has given his animals. Today Kholmamad finds himself in need of purchasing calves to raise in order to take greatest advantage of raising and selling them when necessary. For this reason, Kholmamad is requesting loans from IMON International in order to obtain these animals and raise them so that in time they can be used to support his family.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after the country\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Over the past year, she has improved her lifestyle with a wage that allows her to think past day-to-day subsistence and plan for her family\u2019s future.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Justa would like to open her own restaurant in Puerta Plata.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 53 years old. Nenita is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Nenita owns & operates a business selling personal home products to tourists and local community members. Nenita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Nenita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nenita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Nenita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Nenita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

is a widow who lives in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: buy and sell \"balut\" (fertilized duck eggs) and a general store. Her children are all adults.  Josefina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Josefina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use for more funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future security of her family. Josefina is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is an entrepreneur from Penjikent, Tajikistan, where she sells men\u2019s clothing in one of the local markets. Mahina has been in this business for about four years. \r\n\r\nThe financial assistance of IMON International has helped her increase her assorted merchandise and expand considerably. Mahina has a reasonable pricing policy that attracts customers to her vending facility. \r\n\r\nThis coming spring season, she is planning to increase seasonal inventory, which is why she is requesting a loan of 7500 Somoni. Mahina is hoping to generate additional income and invest part of the profit in reconstruction of her old house, which needs to be repaired. \r\n \r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has a son, Gerson, 10, and a daughter, Fiorella, 18. Deizi currently buys clothes from Lima, formal and informal wear for adults, and sells them to friends and other people she knows. Most of her clients buy on credit and pay her back monthly. In order to have a more consistent income flow, Deizi has started a pastry business, which she prefers rather than selling clothes. She uses a small oven at her home to make a few dozen empanadas, which she sells in the main Plaza in Juliaca. Fieorella and Gerson often stay up until 2:00 am helping their mother make dough for the empanadas.  \r\n\r\nShe is seeking a loan in order to start up a pastry tienda.

She lives in the community of Chua, Peru. She is a member of the Generation 2000 Community Bank in Mazocruz. With her first loan, she purchased one cylinder of oil. Since she was 13 years old, she learned to sell gelatins, cookies and other treats in the local outdoor markets. At 17, she went to the city of Tacna to work as maid and she was able to save some capital. The past four years she has made a living selling combustible fuels. With the $425 loan she is requesting, which she plans to repay within four months, she will purchase two cylinders of oil at about $200\/cylinder. Her goal is to keep growing her business and open a store selling gasoline, oil and kerosene as well as other products like lubricants and additives.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty

He goes to school and helps her a lot.\r\n\r\nFor five years she has been selling fruit and fish, depending on the season, in a kiosk, which was installed in front of her house.  Her most profitable product is the fish.  It is fresh water fish from a river that runs through her city.  But, it is not in season now, so she is selling fruit.  What she likes about her work is that it keeps her active, and it is tranquil work.  Also, it is profitable because she sells her products every day in a very busy location.  Sadith makes sure she treats her customers well.  They feel very satisfied with the way she makes them feel so welcome.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP.  What she likes about working with her community bank is that the members are punctual in their payments, and they are supportive of each other.\r\n\r\nShe will use the money she is asking for to buy more fruit and to expand her kiosk.

He has worked at various jobs, and he has never been afraid to do any job.  He always felt very happy to have work.  He is currently working as a bricklayer.  He puts forth great effort doing this job, and he, therefore, has many contracts.  What he likes most about his work is building houses.  He feels that with his work he is helping a family to have a roof over their heads.  He has been doing this work for ten years.  The most difficult part is loading the heavy planks he uses to hold up the roofs of the houses he builds.  \r\n\r\nIn the near future he would like to buy new materials to help in him in his construction work.\r\n\r\nThis is Javier\u2019s first loan with MFP.

He will use the 1,000 PEN he asked for to buy more mainstays and planks.  The ones that he had are being used on other jobs. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":419584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Buy tools for his work","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-03T18:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Javier","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:39Z","rounded_local_amount":169.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843146},{"amount":116.9,"local_amount":334,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:13Z","rounded_local_amount":339.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734724},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":169.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959789},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":169.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992635},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":167.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717419}],"funded_date":"2009-11-03T21:11:23Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":153681,"name":"Dative","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dative is 37 years old and is married with four children aged between 1 and 9 years.

This will enable her to attract new customers and increase her sales and (hopefully) profits as well.\r\n\r\nWith the continued success of her business, Dative will be able to continue paying school fees for her children and will be able to build a secure future for them.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":428375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase some additional foodstuffs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Rwamagana Kibungo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2009-11-19T20:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dative","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":650000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81250},{"due_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81250},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81250},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81250},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81250},{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81250},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81250},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":81250,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T18:09:44Z","rounded_local_amount":81650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110782236},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":81250,"processed_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:49:58Z","rounded_local_amount":81650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118169338},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":81250,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":81650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124008330},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":81250,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":81650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129037559},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":81250,"processed_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:36:16Z","rounded_local_amount":81650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136760228},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":81250,"processed_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":81650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145022663},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":81250,"processed_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-21T07:56:48Z","rounded_local_amount":81650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152781743},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":81250,"processed_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:43Z","rounded_local_amount":81650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159709622}],"funded_date":"2009-11-19T22:56:20Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":157812,"name":"Melanie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Melanie C. is 35 years old Kaing maker, happily living with her husband Rodolfo C., 40 years old, a fisherman.

The town is a small rural community of approximately 2,000 people. Its residents work in milk production and coffee planting. Its terrain is hilly and a lot of the land is moist like a tropical forest. The town has very picturesque landscapes that combine tropical forest with two pretty lakes, plantations and dairy farms. \r\n\r\nCarlos and his family have been in the dairy business for about five years. He knows from experience as well as from instruction from relatives over time how demanding this business is. He currently wishes to obtain a loan in the amount of $975 to buy a dairy cow in order to increase his milk production. With this loan he will achieve business growth since milk demand is increasing and selling prices are very good. \r\n\r\nCarlos is a member of the Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce (El Sauce Producers Association), one of the 100 partner organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.

The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. She wishes to improve her business and be able to sustain her children's education. \r\n\r\nPriscila joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Priscila has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. Priscila is requesting a new loan of 12,000 Philippine pesos (PHP), which will be used to purchase fertilizers, such as manure. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Priscila from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About CEVI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc., (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

Black Diamond Services sells and maintains custom computer control systems that enable customers to operate household equipment through automated systems. For example, customers could operate their outdoor lighting or security cameras through computer systems. These automated systems also enable customers to access this equipment from outside their homes. Black Diamond Services specializes in customizing the features of these automated control systems to a customer\u2019s needs and specifications. \r\n\r\nCharles employs between 2-10 part-time employees, the number depending on the contracts available. He is married with three children. Charles began his business in response to customer requests for high quality and good customer service. This led him to believe that if he sold quality products, backed them up with superior customer service, and paid attention to customers\u2019 needs, then customers would be willing to pay a premium price for a premium product and service. Charles believes that his business has been successful because of how well he has done in these areas. That 99.9% of his new customers were referred by existing customers is testament to that. \r\n\r\nThis loan helped Charles to purchase new computer control equipment so he could expand his offerings of automated control systems. It is also his third loan and the loans have helped him purchase new equipment and tools as well as increase sales. It is very important that Charles expands his business because he has seen an increased demand for his services from new customers. Without the loans, he would not have been able to expand quickly enough and would have lost those new customers.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6150,"image":{"id":702097,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"New

is a women\u2019s association based in Mopti, Mali with 74 members. The association engages in a variety of activities, such as selling clean cookstoves, teaching women to read and write and educating women about family planning.  \r\n\r\nIn July, nine women from the association starting selling solar lamps (seven of them are featured in the photo).  As of the end of September they sold 1,200 lamps and they have ambitious plans to grow the sales. \r\n\r\nKorotoumou (fourth from the left) is one of nine members of AVEC-Mali who sell solar lamps. She is 47 years old and has six children. In addition to her work with the women\u2019s association, Korotoumou is the matron at a health center in Mopti, and she sells grains.  In July, she started selling solar lamps to fisherman, students and farmers, who are reliant on kerosene and flashlights for light.  With a solar lamp, her customers can save money.  Kerosene and mobile phone charging currently cost about $110 per year; whereas, a solar lamp costs $25 and has a lifetime of about five years.  These solar lamps provide 8 hours of light and can charge a mobile phone.\r\n\r\nOn top of being less expensive, solar lamps are more durable and reliable and keep people from stealing mobile phones. \u201cWith a solar lamp, you don\u2019t have to go to a mobile phone charging station and give your phone to someone who may steal your phone or use the call credit you have on your phone,\u201d says Korotoumou.\r\n\r\nSelling solar lamps provides income for the women and for the association. The women earn $2 for every lamp they sell and the association earns $3.  The money the association earns is invested in a warehouse to store solar lamp inventory and motorcycles to distribute the products.\r\n\r\nThe solar saleswomen are well organized \u2013 each responsible for her own sales territory. They educate their communities about the benefits of solar lights and generate lamp sales through group meetings and demonstrations at night.\r\n\r\nSince customers cannot afford to pay for the lamps up front, the women need working capital. A Kiva loan will allow the solar saleswomen to obtain solar lamp inventory from NOTS Lampe Solaire on credit.

Secondly, they require little space; therefore, you can let them run around in your garden or compound.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

He has been a hard-working boy from childhood when he got a job. This job was very short since he was sacked from the job without any fault of his. He also lost his brother who usually supported him in paying school fees and the basic needs of the family. With these drawbacks in life, poverty set in as he now was really unable to maintain the living standards of the family. He then moved to a little two-room house. The school for the children was changed which made them trek very long distances as they even became sick and expenses grew. Faced with these difficulties, his luck changed when his friend introduced him to GHAPE in 2008 were he got his first loan of 400,000 frs which he finished  paying back. He is now asking for a loan which he will use to purchase newspapers, firewood, and piglets.<P>\r\n\r\nHe knows the business will succeed since his community is in need of firewood for cooking and also the pigs will provide pork and  the  pig manure will be used to improve land to farm food crops and vegetables to the community. <P>\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

For socio-economic reasons, she left school after the 7th grade, Malian education system, to get married. She began earning her living together with her older sister who was very good at selling various goods. She worked for several years with her sister who would give her little things to re-sell when she came back from her business trips to Lom\u00e9, Accra, Abidjan, etc. After these years of learning to the business,  Diaminatou opted for selling clothing, handbags, and shoes, which she has been doing for 4 years.

S., 42, aims to go against the common notion of mediocrity with regard to her business.  She is separated from her husband and thus works hard to earn a living for herself and her child. She and her child live in Maricaban, Pasay City.\r\n\r\nRunning a sari-sari (variety) store is Marelin's occupation. She has run this small-scale business for two years. She adapts well to the trends in her neighborhood when it comes to popular brands of food, shampoo, and drinks.  She also sells some children's toys, accessories, and kitchen merchandise.  Because of her expertise in this field, she earns at least Php10,000 monthly.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she would like to request a Php14,000 loan. She intends to use this loan to buy more quality merchandise to sell. She knows that having a lot of stock will attract more customers to her store.\r\n\r\nMarelin is doing everything she can in order to see her business grow and expand. She wants to become successful in life, be it in her family life or in her business.  She prays for good health and a happy life.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

This is 28-year-old Diana M. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with one child who is three years old. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting two dependants who depend on her because they are orphans. Diana has been running a cafe business since 2005. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all local: rice, <em>ugali<\/em> (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), and plantain (a cooked savory banana) all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces. She works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Asha currently earns about 200 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 525 USD in order to purchase wheat and maize flour, cooking oil, and rice.  In the future, she plans to expand her business. Diana thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":388844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase shoes in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-16T19:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:15Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97023062},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868303},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757499},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:48Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146593},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:24Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984738},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:11Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015411}],"funded_date":"2009-09-17T00:59:33Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":141317,"name":"God Is Wonderful Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is a group of five borrowers led by Jartu R., 48 years old.

His wife stays at home, but is currently training to be a hairdresser. She wants to open a salon so that she can supplement her husband\u2019s income. Dilshod sells hay for animals at his house and at the market. He buys them  wholesale from local farmers. Having worked in this business for 10 years already, he is a well-known seller of hay in his village and has many clients who buy hay from his house. The price he charges for hay is based on the quantity that his customer buys. Dilshod also offers a discount to his frequent buyers who come to him often. With a loan from IMON International, Dilshod plans to increase his stock in order to fully meet the demand of his growing customers. He says that the demand is there and his problem is being able to supply enough hay. The well being of this young family is in your hands.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, such as: Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He earns his income selling the milk and tea produced on his farm, and from running his butcher shop in town. He is able to employ three people in the community. He says that lately the main challenges to his business are lack of clean water, insufficient feed for his livestock and poor marketing and pricing for milk.\r\n\r\nErick has a successful history with Juhudi Kilimo, previously completing a loan of 40,000 KES. He has now requested this loan for 50,000 KES to purchase a dairy cow (40,000) and to expand his butchery business (10,000). He says that with the added income he'll earn he can repay the loan and also care for his family's needs.\r\n\r\nIn the future, he hopes to improve his cows to pedigree level, producing 30 liters per day, and to add to his land.

They are three young women who want to advance.\r\n\r\nMargarita, the coordinator of the group, sells personal accessories such as cosmetics, clothing, shoes, perfumes, and other items. She began this business six years ago, selling only clothing. Then she decided to also sell perfumes, and thus, little by little, she introduced more products. Ana Maria makes door-to-door sales of perfume and other catalog accessories, especially Avon and Zermat products. Her mother began the business, but when she was not able to dedicate the necessary time to it, Ana Maria took over. Finally, Br\u00edgida, the youngest of the group, has barely one year of working in catalog sales of Avon products. Her wish is to be more self-supporting and to also work with other businesses such as Zermat, Oriflame, and Jaquelin Carol.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pam McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":586388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":120,"posted_date":"2010-08-20T14:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Brigida De La Concepcion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":203.12,"local_amount":4352.58,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:21:56Z","rounded_local_amount":4364.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172038142},{"amount":194.84,"local_amount":4175.07,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T11:59:46Z","rounded_local_amount":4186.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177328986},{"amount":127.04,"local_amount":2722.35,"processed_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2729.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182464074},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:38:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1879.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182464075},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":1875,"processed_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:08:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1879.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189096458}],"funded_date":"2010-08-21T18:57:33Z","paid_date":"2011-01-19T09:08:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pam McMurry","image":null}},{"id":228151,"name":"Lenin Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El  Sr. Lenin Antonio M.

She is married to Juanito C.. They are blessed in their marriage to have good health and healthy physiques, which enables them to provide for themselves and their families.\r\n\r\nIrenea operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most of the families only eat home-cooked meals during evenings where all of the family members are at home to take part of the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition, but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of money and time to spend cooking gas and food for one to two persons, when buying cooked rice and viands (prepared dishes) costs less than raw food. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 250 Philippine pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like meats, rice, vegetables, condiments and seasonings. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nIrenea hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year.

K. was born in the village of Kozhoke (in the Osh area of the Kirghiz Republic). She is 42 years old. Nazira and her spouse are raising three remarkable children. Nazira was born into a simple family in which she was the eldest; therefore, she had many chores: looking after younger brothers and sisters, doing housework, and helping on the farm. As a child, Nazira dreamed of becoming a pediatrician, but, alas, life forced her onto another path.  However, today she says her daughter will absolutely become a doctor.  \r\n\r\nWhen she was eighteen, Nazira got married.  By Kirghiz tradition, newly-married couples live in the parents\u2019 house, and Nazira\u2019s husband was a younger son.  Nazira\u2019s husband worked hard on a collective farm; she worked taking care of the family\u2019s livestock, and by then they already had two children. Unfortunately, the 400-square-meter plot of land allocated to each family was not sufficient to plant enough crops to turn a profit.  \r\n\r\nIn 2001, after her parents\u2019 funeral, Nazira\u2019s family moved to the Chuysky valley, into the village of Alekseyevka. Here the couple bought a house with a vegetable garden and bought two milk cows. Income from delivering milk and selling vegetables became Nazira\u2019s family\u2019s livelihood.  Ten years have passed since then, and the family has endured many trials, but thanks to persistence and diligence they are no longer in grave financial condition. Today, on their small farm, there are four calves being fattened, one milk cow, and the family is now cultivating onions.   Nazira is taking out a loan for 100,000 som (KGS) to buy two calves and some ewes. This will allow Nazira to increase her livestock and to expand the farm. In the future, Nazira and her husband dream of giving their children a good education and building a big house.  \r\n\r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":36014,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Homemade incense production - harvesting expenses, storage jars, and transportation to market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Nder","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.255 -15.887222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2007-05-28T20:03:51Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ndeye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-12T00:42:25Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":975,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":82,"local_amount":82,"processed_date":"2007-07-01T09:15:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27571},{"amount":95,"local_amount":95,"processed_date":"2007-07-22T17:33:57Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34398},{"amount":89,"local_amount":89,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T17:04:48Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50185},{"amount":89,"local_amount":89,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:40:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63338},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:49:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80045},{"amount":82,"local_amount":82,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:39:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93781},{"amount":82,"local_amount":82,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:17Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106880},{"amount":82,"local_amount":82,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T20:59:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136703},{"amount":164,"local_amount":164,"processed_date":"2008-04-01T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":164,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":170172},{"amount":82,"local_amount":82,"processed_date":"2008-05-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":197318},{"amount":73,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-01T09:26:19Z","rounded_local_amount":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":224308}],"funded_date":"2007-05-29T00:42:25Z","paid_date":"2008-06-01T09:00:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14268,"name":"Salomat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salomat is married and has 3 children.

She became a member of the TYM Fund in 1996, borrowing money to invest in raising pigs.  In 2002, she and her family used a loan to run a model fish farm in a pond belonging to the local co-operative.  Today, her family has 400 laying ducks, two groups of sows, and one fish pond, which together provide an income of about 3,000,000 VND (180 USD) per month.  In the next lending cycle, she hopes to borrow 10,000,000 VND (600 USD) to buy feed for her animals.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

She is also into selling \"Ready to Wear\" clothing of GTY. Venus has been engaged in her business for over 17 years and earns ~3,200 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Venus joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Venus has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase dried fish to sell. Venus is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP as additional capital for her businesses. This will be her 2nd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Esterlita has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Esterlita joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. Esterlita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her third from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":545745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The tough experience mill she was brought to terms with whilst still running her salon business was enough to help her dispense with the naivet\u00e9 of operating a business.
