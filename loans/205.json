She sells opposite the hospital of Koutiala to a clientele made up of women and men, for cash and credit. <P>\r\n\r\nShe expects to generate a profit of 65,000 F CFA a month that she plans to use for reimbursing the interest on her loan and for participating in daily expenses for the family, investing the remainder in other activities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":269829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchase of potatoes for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-03-02T17:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Coumba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":27777.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:23Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135831},{"amount":55.55,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:33:43Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033630},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620998},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:24:19Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019963},{"amount":55.57,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242708},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:45:18Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678217},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:58:23Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112431},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":28118.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028083},{"amount":55.52,"local_amount":27777.76,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":28118,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873467}],"funded_date":"2009-03-02T22:27:19Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":92504,"name":"Martha Petrona","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nMartha Petrona G.

She is 45 years old. Nena is married and has two school-aged children. Nena runs a \"sari-sari\" or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily-use products such as soap, shampoo, toothpaste, etc., in the local community. Nena has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nena joined GDMPC, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

Although she was able to earn additional income by working at her father\u2019s bakery, Elizabeth wanted to have her own independent business, so she decided to start her little home-based restaurant. Her business has been going quite well. \r\n\r\nElizabeth used her last loan of 1500 soles (about $500) from Manuela Ramos to purchase a special fryer for chicken. Elizabeth plans to use this loan of 2000 soles to purchase six more tables, better chairs, and food in bulk. Elizabeth\u2019s business has grown a lot. On weekends, she now has more customers than she can accommodate at the four tables she has in her restaurant. \r\n\r\nElizabeth lives with her partner and their two children, ages 13 and 7. Her partner works as a supervisor at a company that repairs broken phone lines and downed phone systems. \r\n\r\nElizabeth is glad to be working with Manuela Ramos. She was unable to get loans from other banks because they had too many requirements. Elizabeth also appreciates the educational talks given by Manuela Ramos\u2019s loan officers at every monthly meeting of her communal bank. These talks deal with business-related themes (e.g. how to promote and develop a business) as well as larger themes, such as making life goals, etc. \r\n\r\nElizabeth \"thinks big\" about her business and has many goals for the future. Eventually, she wants to buy an extra-large deep fryer for making french fries. She also wants to turn the front room of her home into a restaurant so she will have a larger and more comfortable space for her customers.\r\n\r\nIn this short video clip, Elizabeth talks about how she wants to expand and improve her business, and how she plans to take full advantage of her loans in order to do so."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":369019,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":957,"youtubeId":"lMkloCHHPfY","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur Elizabeth from  Peru","thumbnailImageId":369019},"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Higher-quality chairs, six tables, food in bulk for a restaurant business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-09-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":410.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074783},{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T01:54:19Z","rounded_local_amount":410.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96990138},{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:38:47Z","rounded_local_amount":410.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103835039},{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":410.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110726886},{"amount":140,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:26Z","rounded_local_amount":410.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118117459}],"funded_date":"2009-09-04T16:19:24Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"June Blender","image":123338}},{"id":133499,"name":"Pranita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Miss Pranita T. is a single woman who lives in Thikedewol.

Noziramo is 47 years old. She and her husband have four children. Noziramo is a kindergarten teacher; however, for several years she has been selling clothing for kids. She spends the income from the business on educating her children, as she and her husband are dreaming that their children will move on into higher education. \r\n\r\nNoziramo has been provided with loans by IMON in the past and has proven to be an accurate and reliable client. Today she is requesting 10,000 TJS for purchasing new goods to sell. Noziramo and her children sincerely thank you for your generous heart.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Chu Th\u1ecb, age 47, lives in the town of Huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh. To make a living, L. raises livestock, specifically cattle, to offer for sale. L. has been engaged in this business for over 18 years and earns approximately 2.800.000 VND a month from these activities. She and her husband have one school-aged child.  \r\n  \r\nIn 2008, L. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services. She hoped to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. L. has successfully repaid her most recent previous loan of 8.288.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. L. is now requesting a new loan of 8.288.000 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. The loan will be the fourth loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA. L. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the borrower's business.\r\n \r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in the rural areas of Hanoi and the northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nL.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

To add more income for the family, her husband also works for others in the local area, for a fee.

Ludmila is typical of many women entrepreneurs who desire to earn extra income to provide a better living for their families.\r\n<p>\r\nLudmila has requested a loan for $800 to use to help her purchase additional inventory to sell. She typically will buy about $400 worth of clothes from her suppliers three times a month. This allows her to maintain an adequate amount of inventory on hand and she can easily update her product selection if an item is selling well or not moving quickly enough.

He works as a taxi driver. He loves being self-employed and managing his own time. Gulomjon has a nice car and offers taxi services around his region. He is a workaholic and is always ready to work non-stop, even on the weekend. <P>\r\n\r\nGulomjon has been in this business for 2 years. Today he is planning to replace the fuel supply system with one using gas as a fuel change, as this is cheaper than petrol. And also his car needs some fixing. For this reason he is asking for a loan of 1200 USD. This will generate additional profit as he finds more clients. This business is a crucial segment of his life, since it is Gulomjon's opportunity to support his family.  <P>\r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 47 years old, married, and has four adult children. To make a living, Virgie owns and manages a fishpond. Her monthly income amounting to 1,200 Philippine pesos (PHP) comes primarily from fishpond-caught fish. \r\n\r\nIn 1999, Virgie joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to do business. Virgie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used as additional capital for her business. Virgie is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used for fishpond maintenance. This loan will be the 12th loan taken out by Virgie from PMPC. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Haitian and Dominican clients generally (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti). She is located in San Pedro de Macoris, a city famous for baseball players and sugar cane industries; where the main economic activity is a free trading zone, a cement factory, and others; and where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. She makes her home here in a simple structure with her 4 children.\r\n\r\nOlga is excited to be taking her second loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business to buy rice, flour, and other foods. Her business is a Colmado, a place where you can find all the ingredients to make your daily food.

This community is in a rural area.  \r\n<p>\r\nCipriana is extremely excited about receiving her fourth loan from Esperanza International.  She manages a fast food business from a stand in front of her house.  Her specialty is fried food.  She plans to invest her new loan in the purchase of supplies such as chicken, plantains, oil, charcoal, and a pot for cooking.  Her earnings are being saved for the future so that she can open a small restaurant in her community, otherwise known as a \u201ccomedor\u201d in the Dominican Republic.  This is one of her dreams along with having a nice house where she can rest and live securely.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group started with Esperanza because of the flexible payments and low interest rate.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. \r\n<p>\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":291206,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy beer, soda and water for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felista","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":104400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613676},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:25Z","rounded_local_amount":104400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010755},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:05Z","rounded_local_amount":104400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233041},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:10Z","rounded_local_amount":104400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664832},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":104400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105544}],"funded_date":"2009-04-02T00:52:40Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":100728,"name":"Houssein","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Houssein is a 32-year-old man who lives in Tyre, southern Lebanon with his wife.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":320379,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase clothes in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T19:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":503062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773303}],"funded_date":"2009-05-18T18:07:38Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":113016,"name":"Maria Selene","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Selene B.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMarilyn is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Marilyn owns & operates a general store selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Marilyn has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\nIn 2005, Marilyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marilyn is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Marilyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has three children, Juan, Bertha, and Wilder, ages 16, 13, and 11, respectively.  They live together in the beautiful jungle of Cusco province, located in the town of Quimbiri, where they have their own house.  \r\n<p>\r\nWhen she was very young, she began working for a farmer who was then growing and harvesting cacao.  She felt that she didn\u2019t have any chance of progressing, and, only with the salary that she was receiving, she took pains to save money with the goal of having her own business.  \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, she grows and sells fruit, specifically pineapples.  Thanks to the education in farming given to her by her parents she now obtains high quality products with which potential purchasers are satisfied.  Because of this the business is giving her good economic results.\r\n<p>\r\nIn general, she works by herself, but occasionally she receives help from her children, and during the harvest season she hires people to assist her in picking and transferring her products to collection centers in her community with the goal of being able to sell them for a fair price.  Her plan for the future is to open her own shop in order to be able to have greater income\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP, and she has promised to continue making all her payments.  She is thankful to her communal group for the solidarity shown to each one of her colleagues.

Mahawak, Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by fishing and selling ready-to-wear clothes. Her husband, Camelo E., age 42, works as a fisherman to earn his living. They have three children who are 11 to 17 years old. \n\nPatricia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Patricia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 12,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 10,800 PHP, thus improving her family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15000, which she intends to use to purchase a pedicab so that she can continue to save up for the future of her children's education and her business. Patricia E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\n\nAbout NWTF:\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem  that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It's for this reason she is requesting her first loan from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

This work allows her to generate an income to support her partner and their son.\r\n\r\nWhen we asked Maribel what she liked about Pro Mujer, she told us that she liked health. \r\n\r\nIn the photo we can see Maribel's cousin who took part in the group."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1825,"image":{"id":789980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Religious Articles","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to puchase sugar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2011-06-14T08:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enola\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irena\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maribel Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luida Gabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena Lina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":12626.25,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1262.72},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1262.72},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1262.72},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1262.72},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1262.72},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1262.72},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1262.72},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1262.72},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1262.72},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1261.77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.51},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.52},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.51},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.51},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.52},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.51},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.52},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.51},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.51},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":365.03,"local_amount":2525.44,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:27:28Z","rounded_local_amount":2540.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221746200},{"amount":547.54,"local_amount":3788.16,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3810.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227115824},{"amount":365.03,"local_amount":2525.44,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:10:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2540.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232877479},{"amount":365.02,"local_amount":2525.44,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:20:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2540.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238694186},{"amount":182.38,"local_amount":1261.77,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1269.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244650221}],"funded_date":"2011-06-16T19:51:20Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T11:07:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Suzanne Grasso","image":357930}},{"id":310547,"name":"Margaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret is 43 years old.

D. C. lives with her daughter, who works as a teacher while also studying at university. They also live with Blanca's granddaughter and brother, who works as a tailor. For 30 years, Blanca has run a shop that sells pupusas which are corn tortillas stuffed with cheese, beans, and pork, then grilled. She has had to work very hard, especially since she is a widow and cannot rely upon anyone else for support, so every day she strives to make enough to live with dignity. Blanca is asking for a loan so that she can buy the ingredients for her pupusas. It is the only way for her to get enough money to cover her costs. She hopes to increase her sales and improve her business, making it the best in the neighbourhood. She hopes that people will recognize the quality of her service. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva

She has 3 children, but only lives with the youngest, in her own home.  Together with her partner, she cultivates peas, potatoes and lettuces.  In the case of the lettuces, she prefers to only tend them half-way because she feels they are very labor intensive and require a lot of patience.  For that reason, she passes on the land and the seed to another person (her partner) and he is then in charge of making it productive.  Meanwhile, Leonidas focuses on the potatoes and peas.  In about three months, when the lettuces are ready, together with her partner, they harvest their products which are then sent to one of the markets in Lima.  If it's Summer season, their profits are larger.\r\nLeonides is very happy to count on an honest partner who repays her by producing a larger yield.\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  It was she who organized all her associates to form their own communal bank where, besides being able to secure loans, they also have life insurance and this is one of the features that Leonidas likes best of all.

She works in a semi-urban area, which is on the outskirts of Kampala. Betty works six days a week. She receives an average of four customers a day and sells to all categories of people.

Their ambition is to buy oxen to enlarge their cultivated land-plots\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":494282,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy various products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-02-25T22:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadiatou   Yeh     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magnama           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Satou                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma\u00efchatou         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safiatou             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bounah              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Selimata              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta                  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadiatou   N\u00e8ma   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:44Z","rounded_local_amount":168614.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021680},{"amount":350,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":168614.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746471},{"amount":350,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:09Z","rounded_local_amount":168614.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779011},{"amount":350,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:38Z","rounded_local_amount":168614.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961215},{"amount":350,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:42Z","rounded_local_amount":168614.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699373},{"amount":350,"local_amount":166666.65,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:27Z","rounded_local_amount":168614.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913300}],"funded_date":"2010-02-27T15:16:31Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":183533,"name":"Alejandrina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Alejandrina es socia del Banco Comunal Anabella.\nAlejandrina es casada, tiene 64 a\u00f1os y 7 hijos, Alejandrina junto a su esposo tienen un foto estudio en donD. brindan servicios D. filmaciones, fotograf\u00eda, revelados, venta D. c\u00e1maras, rollos.\nAlejandrina necesita un pr\u00e9stamo D. 3000 soles dinero que ser\u00e1 invertido en la compra D. materiales fotogr\u00e1ficos.\nEl sue\u00f1os D.

Marysia is 37 years old, married, and has a three-year-old daughter. Marysia studied to be a doctor, but before she started practicing medicine, she gave birth to her daughter who was premature.  She decided to stay home and care for her baby.  While at home, she decided to start her own catering business, which she did shortly after her daughter's birth.  \r\n\r\nWith a small amount of money from her husband, Marysia began buying some catering supplies and offering her services for events such as weddings and kitchen parties.  In 2009, her friend introduced her to Tujijenge Tanzania, and Marysia has now had three loans.  With the previous loans, Marysia bought tablecloths and fabric for decorations, serving dishes, buffet tables, plates, a charcoal cooker, and a gas cooker.  This has allowed her to grow her business, which now employs 8-10 staff.  Profits vary depending on the number of events Marysia caters, but can be up to 3,000,000 Tsh per month (about $2100).  \r\n\r\nThis is Marysia's first Motisha loan. A Motisha loan is a product offered by Tujijenge Tanzania that allows borrowers with good credit ratings to pay back their original loans faster and receive extra money before their original loan term has ended.  Marysia has some big events coming up, and she will use this loan to buy extra drinking glasses and fabric for decorations.  Marysia dreams of growing her business and if she makes a profit from this loan, she will save to buy a music system, and someday to make a trip to China to buy more catering and decoration supplies. Marysia also recently started working as a medical doctor during the week, and greatly enjoys her two different types of work. \r\n\r\nMarysia is the President of the Kimanga Group.  The 10 group members will hold each other accountable for repaying the loan. In the photo, Marysia is the middle of the back row, wearing a striped polo shirt.

his sugarcane farming business in Ntungamo with his hard work, proficiency, and tenacity over the past year. The start-up capital for this business came courtesy of his prior carpentry business. To say the new business is \"up and running\" is the fairest of descriptions.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, Henry still has a ways to go in the acquisition of solid-enough experience, but given his upbeat and open-minded attitude, he is on the inside track to make it. Weekly, his gross sales returns total 40,000 Ugandan shillings (UGX).

Her business is their only source of income and thank God it has provided them with everything they need to get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe has had her business for 15 years and has done well.

Her motherly love has been enough to show him that she needs to work hard to help her children get ahead with excellent values and education. Jackline is a smallholder farmer in the Cherengany, Kitale area of Kenya. In the past ten years, she has bred more than one dairy cow and has developed her farm. Jackline was unable to study to get a professional career because of the economic situation that her family faced. However, she never gave up and she has been practicing farming. Because of how much she likes farming, she has even nicknamed one of her cows, which makes him a very proud farmer, especially when she is milking her cows. Through his dairy cow, she is able to get between 5-10 liters a day, and this helps him support her family. Jackline also practices crop farming, but she has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements, and that is why she is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. Through the loan, she will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer, and pesticides that she will use to greatly improve her crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques; using high-quality seeds will assure him of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. Jackline is visionary, and her goal for the season is to boost her crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year. All this can be achieved through lenders\u2019 help and goodwill. Jackline believes that through the loan, she will turn around her family life and be able to give her children a solid educational background.

They serve mainly girls who can not make it in the formal schooling sector.\r\n\r\nThis will be the second loan St. Joseph Vocational Institute is requesting from Kiva through SMT.

Her husband, Mr. Pheth Mouv, is a fisherman who  gathers small fish, but does not have enough fishnets to catch the fish. Thus, his wife, Mrs. Phann Y., decided to ask for a loan to buy more fishnets for her husband's business. Mrs. Phann Y. has a child who is employed in a garment factory. \r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan consisting of mainly end-of-term loans. Thirteen members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor coverage of basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":320470,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase crops in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T21:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":500812.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773315}],"funded_date":"2009-05-17T03:45:34Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:06:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":113048,"name":"Wungeh Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph is married and has five children.

He plans to use the money he is asking for to refurbish his vehicle in order to be able to work peacefully and offer security to the different passengers that he transports day to day.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":420854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Refurbish his car","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-05T22:30:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roger","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":316.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":335.68},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":347.19},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":363.35},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":387.76},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":398.3},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":418.13},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":432.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.49},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.52},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.71},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.41},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":146.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":110.89,"local_amount":316.83,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:12Z","rounded_local_amount":321.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843161},{"amount":228.38,"local_amount":652.51,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:47Z","rounded_local_amount":662.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734743},{"amount":10.63,"local_amount":30.36,"processed_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":30.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124102},{"amount":127.17,"local_amount":363.35,"processed_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":368.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959808},{"amount":135.71,"local_amount":387.76,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":393.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992653},{"amount":139.41,"local_amount":398.3,"processed_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":404.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717437},{"amount":146.34,"local_amount":418.13,"processed_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":424.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751189},{"amount":151.47,"local_amount":432.76,"processed_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:51Z","rounded_local_amount":439.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933744}],"funded_date":"2009-11-30T06:44:50Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":154186,"name":"Brigitte","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Brigitte T. est une veuve de 57 ans, m\u00e8re de 4 enfants.

Brian recognizes that alternative fuel methods, while in demand, are costly for the average consumer, and his idea was to sell affordable products to meet this demand.\r\n\r\nBrian started his business on Ebay (an online buying and selling organization), where it was very successful. In the summer of 2008, shortly after he began selling, world oil prices took off and Brian's business became wildly profitable. He now has three very busy employees and keeps costs down by ordering in bulk, so that he can keep shipping costs affordable for his customers. He's going to use this loan to purchase inventory so that he can stay ahead of the curve in meeting his customers\u2019 demands - as he says, \"if I run out, it's an emergency!\"\r\n\r\nAware of his participation in the \"green\" movement, Brian is convinced that renewable energy is \"the fuel of the future\" because \"unlike everything else, it won't run out at some point.\" Though Brian wants to stay on the cutting edge in terms of designing innovative renewable energy products, he always keeps an eye towards his customers and makes sure to continue offering the products they want. Brian hopes that one day, he can run a biodiesel station on the highway that will be affordable enough to entice the average driver away from the gas station.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since

She earns a living by operating a fish vending business.  Her husband Romeo, who is 60 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps his wife's business activities. They have two children who are 35 and 37 years old. \r\n\r\nErlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired to have something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, lifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 18th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use to improve her business so that she can continue to save up for future house improvement. Erlinda M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

He has his own motorboat and works with their children. Teresa runs a convenience store selling ice cream sandwiches and other items. Her aspirations are to grow her business and invest in more products, and in this way she can strengthen her inventory since she currently doesn't have enough selection to satisfy demand. Of course, through the loan she expects to keep making improvements. Her business is located in Salinas Grandes, where she lives, and she's been doing it for 15 years. The idea came to her after they opened up a new storefront where she lived and there were no businesses, so she thought of setting up the convenience store until she made it a reality. Along with offering household products like rice, sugar, oil, milk and other items, she also sells ice cream sandwiches and fish brought in by her husband. The loan will be used to improve her inventory to satisfy her customers demands.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

collective farm as a common worker. He is 57 years old, he is married. Even by the middle eastern standards he is considered a father of many children - he has six. His older children have already grown up and are helping their mother and father. Beside his job at the farm Olimchon also feeds cattle. Right now he has several heads of cattle and sheep. His wife and older daughters are taking care of the cattle (his older daughter is on the photo). Additionally, Olimchon plans to buy one more calf and fodder.

She lives in her parents\u2019 house, and she wants to help with the household expenses.  That\u2019s why she is determined to work very hard.  Rosa\u2019s cheese stand is located in the Santa B\u00e1rbara Market (an important market in the city of Juliaca). She is a very charismatic and candid saleswoman who always waits on her customers with a smile on her lips.  What she likes most about her business is conversing with her neighbors in the market.  She has been involved in this activity for three years and considers the most difficult part of her job obtaining the tastiest cheeses since she has a well-earned reputation and people know her cheeses are highly sought-after.  In the near future, she hopes to have a very large shop in which she can sell many more products and, thus, improve her income so that she can give her parents a peaceful old age.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Rosa\u2019s fourth loan with MFP, and she is committed to making her payments on time, just as she has done with prior loans.  She is a very happy person and beloved in her community bank, and she hopes to be able to continue working well with all her colleagues. She plans to invest the 1000 New Soles applied for in the purchase of more cheeses with which she hopes to increase her earnings.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Richard Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":370540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase in inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-17T21:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:06Z","rounded_local_amount":171.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641713},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:20Z","rounded_local_amount":171.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081165},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:06:56Z","rounded_local_amount":171.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997316},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:28Z","rounded_local_amount":171.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842660},{"amount":116.2,"local_amount":332,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:26Z","rounded_local_amount":340.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734242}],"funded_date":"2009-08-17T23:54:17Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rick & Pat Brown","image":null}}]}
