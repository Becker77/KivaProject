Her husband is a taxi driver and the income he gets is the only source of income for the family. Howieda wants to help her husband to pay for purchasing a new engine for the taxi the family owns in order to improve it, but she has not enough money to pay, so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. \r\n\r\nWhen Howieda gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to help her husband and pay to purchase new engine for the taxi. This will improve the taxi's capacity for working and enable her husband to work extra hours to increase the family income and offer to them better living conditions. Howieda is a conservative woman, so her husband is photographed next to the taxi.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

After trying several activities without success, for the last 10 years Mahoua has been working as a small-scale retailer, buying and selling clothing supplies (wax cloth known as \"pagne,\" embroidered fabric, etc) and handbags. She buys these items locally from wholesalers from Bamako and Sikasso then re-sells at the market where her products are very much in demand for their high quality. Most of her customers are cleaning ladies and sellers of condiments. \r\n\r\nIn order to meet the demand from her growing number of customers, she decided to join micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso.

She is 51 years old. Anaceta is married and has four adult-aged children. To make a living, Anaceta owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from engaging in the buying and selling of dried fish in their village. She peddles her product every day. During our visit to Anaceta, her dried fish was already sold out. Anaceta has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities. She is hoping for more improvement to her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Anaceta joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anaceta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Anaceta is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Anaceta from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":339364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Occidental. She earns her living operating her general store and restaurant.\r\n\r\nMelania\u2019s husband, Teotimo, helps his wife in running the business. They have seven children: some adults and some of school age. The children who are currently going to school also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nMelania joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in her general store and restaurant. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 10,000.\r\n\r\nMelania is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 10,000 was used to fund operations for her general store, and had a positive impact on both her business and on the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing Php 19,500 for her 13th loan which she intends to use on the general store and restaurant.\r\n\r\nMelania is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":484737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nSharol is married and has three young children. To make a living, Sharol owns and operates a business making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from preparing and selling cooked food for daily meals. Sharol has been engaged in her business for more than three years and earns approximately 5000 PHP monthly.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sharol joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Sharol is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Sharol from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

Her husband currently is working in Russia. Gulbahor is a devoted mother who struggles day after day to provide the best for her family. \r\n\r\nTen years ago, she got an idea to start raising the cattle to contribute to the family finances, taking advantage of the space she had available in her house for this business. Slowly, the number of cows increased and with them, her clients started asking for more and more. With an endless list of requests, Gulbahor has finally decided to increase the number of livestock she keeps and for this reason she is requesting a loan of $1,500.     \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

This area is known for the delicious desserts and sweets which its residents produce and which are known throughout the country.\r\n\r\nHere we meet 38 year-old Decsy.  She is a single mother and has 4 children aged 18, 16, 15 and 8.  The three eldest are in school but the youngest is not yet in school.  She tells us that it is a very difficult job being both father and mother to her children but that she always tries to do everything she can so that her children have a very good education.\r\n\r\nDecsy makes and sells sweets.  She works four days every week.  In the mornings she gets up at 5.00am to make her sweets.  Once they are ready she delivers them to salespeople who take them to sell in Tosagua, Chone and other cantons.  Her children help her in her work.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy the necessary ingredients for making her sweets.  Decsy is a founding member of her community bank and she is very happy because thanks to the loans she has been able to improve her business and get her children ahead in life.  Her dream has always been to have a small business with machinery so that she can make more sweets."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":652375,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy ingredients to make sweets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:33Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Decsy Rossany","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188683363},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:33:17Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191422487},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195841256},{"amount":275.01,"local_amount":275.01,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:02:57Z","rounded_local_amount":275.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201283640},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":183.34,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:00:38Z","rounded_local_amount":183.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206151586},{"amount":91.63,"local_amount":91.63,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":91.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211224520}],"funded_date":"2010-12-17T12:44:18Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:13:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":256952,"name":"Teodosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teodosa is fifty-six years old.

As a responsible father, Paulus wants to provide his children with access to school. He wants them to have a bright future. \r\n\r\nPaulus wanted to improve his kiosk but he did not have enough capital to do it. He ever tried to borrow from a cooperative with daily repayment. But there was no improvement in his business as the profit was used to pay the installments. Paulus then heard about TLM\u2019s individual lending program and got interested in joining the program due to the monthly repayment system and achievable interest rate.

buying & selling ready to wear clothing. She lives in Bayawan City, Negros Oriental. Delia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 9 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Delia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 30000, which she intends to use as additional capital so that she could continue to save up for the future to improve living conditions. Delia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Eight years ago she decided to start a business selling construction supplies when a difficult financial situation in the family forced her to look for a stable source of income. Today Olena rents a small store in downtown Ivano-Frankivsk and three vending kiosks in the local market. She currently has about $6,000 in working capital and her monthly net profit amounts to $1,200. She is the only breadwinner in the family. \r\n\r\nOlena is a focused hard-worker. Her experience in the construction supply trade and reasonable pricing policy has helped to keep her business stable for many years. Lending services from \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d have also had a big part in the consistent growth of Olena\u2019s business. She has taken out and repaid a total of 15 loans. Recently, she was able to open three new vending kiosks in the market with financing from a loan. One of Olena\u2019s long term plans is to rent another more spacious vending facility in downtown Ivano-Frankivsk.\r\n\r\nOlena would like to get a loan of $1,200 to purchase 20 fillet sets (200 items each) to sell in her stores. This financial assistance will help Olena increase her sales and grow her business as a result. Not only will it help her get the necessary inventory and attract more customers, but it will help Olena meet the needs of her family and provide a better livelihood for them.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in a neighborhood where many of the inhabitants belong to the educational sector.  In general, the people in the community are characterized as being supportive neighbors.\r\n\r\nShe studied Hotel Administration, and she lived in Cartagena for 20 years.  She knew a lot of people there, and she got the idea to sell clothes.  She got her initial merchandise through catalogs.  A little over two years ago Belia worked for a company that closed.  She used her savings to build her place and created her business, Belia Boutique.\r\n\r\nOnce again she went to live in San Juan Nepomuceno, the place where she was born.  She continues to take care of her customers from Cartagena, and she is adding to her business with new customers from Juan Nepomuceno.  \r\nThe business has been very important to her because she is economically dependent upon it.  This is true even though she receives income from her apartment, which is rented because she lives in her parents\u2019 house.\r\n\r\nShe is currently asking for her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for 2,300,000 COP.  She will buy clothing and elegant footwear for women, men, and children, which has been requested by her customers.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to expand her place and to later on have a car.  She would use the car to travel and bring merchandise from Bogot\u00e1 and Medell\u00edn.  Her big challenge is continuing to be unemployed and supporting herself with her business.  \r\n\r\nAnother big challenge and lesson was when she gave credit to people she did not know, and she lost part of the money she had saved.  The bills she had to pay grew, and there was money she could not collect.  She does not have that now.  Finally, with this negative experience she learned to be very careful choosing her customers.  That is precisely what she now does, and it makes her choose them well.\r\n\r\n  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":520378,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy clothing and elegant footwear for women, men, and children;

But the money which Ulugbek earned working  around the clock, didn\u2019t cover the needs of his family of three children. In 1994, with the wholehearted support of his wife, who worked as a teacher at the local school, Ulugbek decided to start his business selling office supplies. Using their money, which they put away for a rainy day, this couple began to sell office suppliers and bags at the local market. Due to strong efforts and hard work, Ulugbek managed to buy a house and a used car for his family. His conscientious attitude to work allowed him to gain a reputation of being a responsible businessman. \r\n\r\nBut in June 2010, when violent clashes caused by the deposed political regime broke out in the city of Osh, Ulugbek lost his business. His sales shop at the market was robbed and looted. But Ulugbek didn\u2019t give up and decided to resume his lost business and continue his activities.

Julieta aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the  Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Although aged 32, this mother of 3 has a steady income as a Cocoa seeds buy & sell sales lady. She has been in the business since 2 years. With an initial capital of Rp3,000,000 (about US$330), Ani, her nickname, within one day could buy cocoa up to 300kg from several farmers who directly came to her home. Price per kg varied depending on quality, and water content. After processed (dried in the sun) for half to 1 day, Ani resells it to the distributor, of course  at a higher price. Usually she delivers once every 2 days. Sales results are around Rp3,200,000-Rp3,300,000 (about US$352-363). So within 2 days Ani could get a nett profit of Rp100,000-200,000 (about US$11-22) after subtracting labor and transportation cost.\r\nAdditional loan from Dinari would be used to buy a scale and additional capital to buy more goods for sale. Her hope is that results \/ profits  could increase, and help Ketut Suarba, her husband to pay for education expenses of their 2 daughters, who are already in Middle school & Grade school, and atoddler son.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nGesit, ulet dan bersahaja , julukan itu cocok di berikan pada Ni Ketut Aniantari  meski usianya baru 32 tahun Ibu dari tiga orang anak ini sudah memiliki sumber penghasilan tetap yaitu sebagai seorang Pedagang Jual Beli Biji Kakao. Usaha ini telah ditekuninya sejak 2 tahun lalu . Dengan modal awal sebesar Rp. 3.000.000,- Ani, begitu orang biasa memanggilnya, dalam sehari bisa membeli kakao sampai 300 Kg dari beberapa petani yang datang langsung kerumahnya . Harga per 1 Kg nya berpariasi tergantung pada kwalitas barang dan kadar kandungan airnya . Setelah di proses ( dijemur ) kurang lebih \u00bd s\/d 1 hari, oleh Ani dijual kembali kepada pedagang induk tentunya dengan harga yang  lebih tinggi . Pengiriman yang dilakukan biasanya setiap 2 hari sekali dengan hasil penjualan berkisar Rp. 3.200 000;- s\/d Rp. 3.300.000.-  . Jadi dalam waktu 2 hari Ani mendapatkan keuntungan bersih Rp 100.000,- s.d 200.000 setelah di potong ongkos buruh maupun ongkos angkut. \r\nMendapat tambahan modal dari Dinari oleh Ani dipergunakan untuk membeli sebuah alat timbangan dan sebagai tambahan modal untuk bisa membeli barang dagangan yang lebih banyak lagi . Dengan harapan hasil \/ keuntungan yang di dapat semakin banyak , dan dapat membantu Ketut Suarba, suaminya, dalam membiayai pendidikan 2 orang putrinya yang sudah duduk di bangku SMP & SD dan satu lagi putranya yang masih balita."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":78859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To add capital to buy more cocoa seeds and buy a sitting scale<p>Menambah modal usaha agar dapat membeli lebih banyak biji kako dan untuk membeli timbangan duduk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-26T14:35:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ketut Ani Antari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-11-09T19:41:30Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2008-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2007-12-03T08:25:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:35:05Z","rounded_local_amount":411386.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":90247},{"amount":45,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T02:16:25Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:35:38Z","rounded_local_amount":411386.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106841},{"amount":45,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2008-02-01T01:06:30Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:36:43Z","rounded_local_amount":411386.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":125398},{"amount":45,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2008-03-03T01:56:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":411386.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":147627},{"amount":45,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2008-04-03T02:54:41Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":411386.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":171987},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-05-05T01:22:30Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:40:22Z","rounded_local_amount":347393,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201081},{"amount":38,"local_amount":337777.78,"processed_date":"2008-06-09T05:34:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:47Z","rounded_local_amount":347393,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232170},{"amount":59,"local_amount":524444.44,"processed_date":"2008-07-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:47Z","rounded_local_amount":539373.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":261670},{"amount":45,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2008-08-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:40Z","rounded_local_amount":411386.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":290617},{"amount":45,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2008-09-09T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-19T07:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":411386.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":321017}],"funded_date":"2007-10-26T18:41:30Z","paid_date":"2008-09-19T07:10:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":26685,"name":"Loeng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. S.

She's a teacher. Besides teaching time at school, she has a lot of free time to take care of family and do some small business.  Her husband and she have two children, one of whom has got married and moved out, while the other is in college. For this loan cycle she'd like to borrow 4,256,000 VND (or 245 USD) to buy rice to make wine and raise cattle.  Everyday, Mrs. Phuong's husband also helps her with her store and the small farm.  Her family loves the model of microcredit, because it enables to have small payments while still have some savings and plan to pay for their children's schooling.  Mrs. Phuong and her group has fully repaid their first loan cycle.  This time other members in Mrs. Phuong's group want to borrow at levels listed below:\r\n+ Mrs. Le Thi Tan, 33 years old, wants to borrow 3,808,000 VND (or 220 USD) to sell sundry goods.\r\n+ Mrs. Nguyen Thi X., 27 years old, wants to borrow 4,704,000 VND (or 270 USD) to invest in her family's carpenter's shop.\r\n+ Mrs. Nguyen Thi T., 44 years old, wants to borrow 4,256,000 VND (or 245 USD) to

He got into the business in October of 1988, beginning as a driver of a microbus with a fixed route.  Later he bought his own vehicle in order to start working for himself, although with the inconvenience of having to rent the taxi permit.

This older couple established a small family home years ago in the middle of the best territory of the capital city of Phnom Penh, and they have given birth to seven children, two of whom are married. Three of their children are employed at a variety of occupations: one is a vegetable seller, one sells clams, and one is a building worker. \n\nYoeum P. currently sells different kinds of vegetables in the market to earn a living, and her husband assists her in selling her produce.

We take this opportunity to know a few of the members a little bit better.\r\n<p>\r\nYolanda is 50 years old and has been selling beauty products for more than eight years.  A friend convinced her to work after she separated from her husband when her children were 15 and 12 years of age.  At the time, Yolanda was working as an assistant at a state school.  She offers her products with great enthusiasm to acquaintances, friends, teachers, and parents at the school.  Over time she decided to sign up to proviD. cosmetics from various lines (Esika, Avon, and Natura) and become a beauty consultant.  Her business is profitable because the only capital required is the money needed to purchase merchandise for her inventory.  Yolanda\u2019s hard work and desire to succeed have enabled her to fulfill her duty as a mother to proviD. food, clothing, and an education for her son who is studying electrical engineering.  Her ex-husband no longer provides financial support.  Her business went through some ups and downs as a result of paying for medical expenses and treatment when her son became ill.  He recovered quickly and afterwards she was able to buy a small refrigerator for her home.  She is requesting a loan to purchase cosmetics.  She hopes to have a house of her own sometime later because she has been a caretaker at a children\u2019s home for the past nine years.  \r\n<p>\r\nAng\u00e9lica is 39 years old.  She began working nine years ago by selling candy out of a cart that she parked outsiD. of the state schools.  On the weekends, she carried a basket of candy to sell at parks, stadiums, and patron saint festivals in the district of Chosica.  She normally sells in the afternoons and evenings because she spends her mornings performing her household chores.  The loans she has received have been used to purchase merchandise (peanuts, beans, popcorn, soft drinks, cookies, snacks, and candy).  In addition she crochets and knits items such as baby outfits, jackets, sweaters, caps, and ponchos. Ang\u00e9lica also does appliqu\u00e9s with beads, tassels, shells, strips of wood, or whatever material is in fashion and requested by her customers.  She currently has outstanding orders for dresses and jackets, so she needs a loan to purchase crochet needles and colored wool.  Her earnings will enable to help her husband with paying for food, clothing, and education for their children.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3450,"image":{"id":461636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Operating capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:47Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fiorella De Fatima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hortencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Justa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evila Teodocia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9950,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2487.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2487.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2487.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2487.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":862.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":862.67,"local_amount":2488,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2493.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064632},{"amount":862.33,"local_amount":2487,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2492.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899691},{"amount":862.67,"local_amount":2488,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2493.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933774},{"amount":862.33,"local_amount":2487,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2492.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661367}],"funded_date":"2010-01-15T14:21:39Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":170375,"name":"Janet","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janet M. is a 31-year-old married woman who lives in the village Brgy Taliban, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental.

They have three children who are aged 7 to 11 years old, who are all currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nJanet M. joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family.

Now she earns an average monthly income of $117 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nJanet M. is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of 13,000 PHP was used to fund the operations of her food-vending business, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing her 5th loan, in the amount of 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use on her food-vending business. \r\n\r\nJanet M. is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

To making a living, Y. owns and operates a business venture in the manufacturing sector operating a furniture-making business. The main source of income for the business comes from making and selling general household furniture to local businesses and community members.  Y. has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 6,000,000 VND per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Y. joined Kiva partner, SEDA, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Y. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,392,000 VND from SEDA. This loan was used to purchase additional raw materials to expand her product offering. Y. is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND, which will be used to purchase tools and other equipment to expand the business. The loan will be her third from SEDA.  Y. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About SEDA<\/b><br>\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to low-income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Kyrgyzstan).  She is 49 years, a widow and has four children.  Sanabar was born in a simple family.  Being the oldest child in the family of ten children, she spent the majority of her time taking care of the household, such as looking after her younger brothers and sisters, doing household and caring for a small farm.  During her childhood, Sanabar dreamed of becoming a teacher, but her life forced her to pick a different destiny.  She finished school in 1980, and, according to an old tradition, her parents married her off to the Alay district in 1981.  The young family had their first child in 1983.  According to the sharia law, newlyweds remained living in the parents' home because Sanabar's husband was the youngest son.  Sanabar's husband diligently worked at a collective farm, and Sanabar took care of the domestic animals.  By that time, they already had two young children.  The collective farm allotted them very little land because at that time, one family got only 200 square meters.  It was impossible to grow anything on such a small plot of land, and the family's expenses exceeded the profits.  Years passed, and the family grew to six people.  Sanabar's husband was a leading farmer in his native village, but disaster fell on the family in 2002, when Sanabar's husband was killed by unknown men.  Five years later, Sanabar and her children decided to move to the Chui valley.  The family bought a house in 2007 in the Poltavka village and started a livestock breeding business with the purchase of one horse.  Four years passed since then, and the family experienced many challenges during this time, but thanks to Sanabar's persistence and hard work, her business became successful.  Now the household has two horses and four sheep.  In addition, the family grows beats and sell kumyz (horse milk).  Sanabar is requesting a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) for the purchase of two horses for fattening up.  Sanabar plans to use the loan for continued development and growth of her business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2225,"image":{"id":798318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase horses and grow her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Poltavka village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-06-23T20:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2225,"lender_count":76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sanabar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1112.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":50361.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287370687},{"amount":1112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:17:09Z","rounded_local_amount":50361.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372862734}],"funded_date":"2011-06-24T09:30:32Z","paid_date":"2013-06-17T09:17:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":314352,"name":"Antonia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Antonia es natural de Hualahoyo, siempre ha vivido all\u00ed y en la actualidad vive con sus 3 hijos y su anciana madre en la casa que hered\u00f3.

She has always lived there and she lives with her 3 children and her elderly mother in a house which she inherited. Since she was a girl she grew up in an agricultural and farming family. She learned all that she needs to cultivate her fields where she plants corn, potatoes, peas, fava beans, and other products. She raises her livestock in a stable. Following the separation from her husband, this has been her way of life and it has given her all the income that she needs. She lives from the sales of the milk produced by her dairy cows and from the sale of potatoes and corn in the city's local market. Her children help her in the agricultural work and it is thanks to this team effort that she is awarded with her income. Today her plans are to increase the quantity of livestock and to acquire a good breed of cattle to produce more milk per day.

Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with decent salary. Sahar has a project of raising poultry and benefits from selling its products. She wants to expand her project and purchase more poultry and more fodder to feed them, but the amount of money she has is not enough to pay for this. This is why she has requested a loan from FATEN. When Sahar gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to expand her project and purchase more poultry and fodder. This will increase her sales and increase her income, which will offer better life conditions for her and her family. Sahar is a conservative woman, so her husband Tha'er appears in the photograph instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

B., currently I am in the business of selling typical clothing in the village of Cruz Blanca of San Juan Sacatepequez where I live.  It has been approximately four years since I came into the business of selling clothing.  At first I helped a woman sell her merchandise on commission.  At that time I worked at a vegetable packing plant and, since I had already acquired experience selling clothing, I started to invest part of my salary in selling sweaters.  Thereafter, I got married and had a daughter so I dedicated myself completely to the business which is why I saw the need to invest more capital in the business.  I now also sell local clothing such as guipiles, shirts, shawls, girdles and other products which my clients might request such as sandals.  Since I now have a fixed clientele, I deliver the clothing to my customers' homes or they stop by my home to make their purchases.  What I want to accomplish is to be able to invest more capital and to put a stall in San Juan Sacatepequz.  However, this requires a lot of capital which is why I want to increase my clientele to obtain this capital.  This will allow me to take advantage of the important upcoming holidays. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Translated from Spanish by Cindy M., Kiva Volunteer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoy Carmen Beatriz C. B., actualmente mi negocio es vender ropa t\u00edpica en la aldea Cruz Blanca de San Juan Sacatep\u00e9quez, es donde yo vivo. \r\nHace aproximadamente  cuatro a\u00f1os que inicie en el negocio de la venta de ropa, pero primero yo \u00fanicamente le ayudaba a una se\u00f1ora a vender su mercader\u00eda y ella me pagaba una comisi\u00f3n, en ese entonces yo tenia un trabajo en una empacadora de verduras y con el salario que tenia, como yo ya hab\u00eda adquirido experiencia en la venta de ropa empec\u00e9 a invertir parte de mi salario para vender su\u00e9teres, pero despu\u00e9s que me case y que tengo ya una nena, me dediqu\u00e9 totalmente al negocio, por eso vi la necesidad de invertir m\u00e1s capital ya que, ahora vendo cortes t\u00edpicos, g\u00fcipiles, blusas, rebozos, fajas, y alguna otra cosa que mis clientas me van solicitando, como sandalias.  Como ya cuento con clientes fijos, la ropa la entrego en las casas de ellas o ellas llegan  a mi casa para comprar, pero lo que quiero lograr es poder invertir m\u00e1s capital y poder poner un local en San Juan Sacatep\u00e9quez, pero eso requiere de mucho capital, por lo que quiero primero ganar m\u00e1s clientes obtener ese capital que necesito y aprovechar las fechas importantes m\u00e1s pr\u00f3ximas para vender y que en un plazo no muy largo pueda poner mi local."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":155727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She loves selling goods, the business through which she makes a living. \r\n\r\nFor more than five years, Emelia has been selling fruits such as bananas and oranges by the side of the road in Koforidua. She treks to surrounding villages to purchase bananas and oranges from farmers.  Emelia buys unripe bananas in bulk and covers them with plantain leaves in the bush. When they are ripe, she picks them up to sell to her customers. For lack of adequate working capital, she is not able to buy enough stock to make enough profit to support her family.

The dried fish, part of which is set aside to be sold during the shortages and winter months to earn greater revenues, is sold primarily in Dougabougou, Siribala, Niono, Shango, Boussin and in the weekly fairs at Segou.

She was married for many years and blessed with three children, who are married and no longer living at home. To earn a living, Lach N. owns a hand-cart that she uses to hawk, selling cakes and boiled corn to the people around her district.  She is usually able to generate about $5 of income a day.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 46, married, and has three children. Molmol graduated from medical college as a nurse and devoted 15 years of practical experience to helping her patients to overcome their diseases. \r\n\r\nIn 1995, when Molmol was expecting a baby, her husband lost his job. Those times became a period of living in the pinch of poverty for her family. But Molmol didn\u2019t give up and decided to start her own business reselling linens, fabrics and tablecloths, using her initial capital of 10,000 KGS.\r\n\r\nIn spite of many the highs and lows in her activity, Molmol managed to broaden her business by purchasing two small shops and achieved success. These activities led her to obtain loans from \u201cBai Tushum and Partners\u201d, which were repaid without any delays. Molmol\u2019s husband, who was infected by her enthusiasm, became the main helper and strong supporter in the business. \r\n\r\nBut in June 2010, when violent clashes caused by deposed the political regime broke out in Osh, Molmol lost her business. Her shops were robbed and looted. However, Molmol  is ready to resume her lost business and continue to work. For this reason, Molmol is applying for a loan of 135,000 KGS, which she needs to restart her activity. She plans to purchase home products for resale at the local market.

Her husband\u2019s support of this business is Lorena\u2019s inspiration to persevere through the test of poverty to grow her business despite her circumstances. Sari-sari stores basically sell small quantities of various foodstuffs, groceries and beverages. \u201cSari\u201d is a native word for variety. These small stores are either attached to the owner\u2019s house or in a small native cottage not far from the owner\u2019s home. Such stores are convenient for people in the barangay (village) who live far from the marketplace or town.\r\n<br>This kind of business has brought pleasure to Lorena\u2019s family. With its profits, she has been able to support her family\u2019s need. Being a good mother, Lorena always wanted to support her three children in whatever career they would choose to better their personal life. Aside from Lorena\u2019s variety store business financed by the loan she received from Kiva partner, ASHI, she also has a buy and sell business, which is her way of saving profits to support her family's needs, especially her children\u2019s education until college. With this in mind, Lorena is requesting a loan from Kiva lenders to purchase grocery items for her store and support her buy and sell business. This loan will help her businesses grow and make more profit, which will enable her to support her ambitions in life.\r\n<br>Lorena has been an ASHI member since 2004. Her family is very thankful that she has an opportunity to improve her living conditions through the income of her two businesses, both of which she has established with the support of previous loans. Her long-term goals are to have passenger jeepney (small bus) for added income, expand to a fully fledged grocery store, and give her children a better future. These dreams fuel her to continue her dedication to her ventures.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":632448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He is a retired civil servant hence depends on his pension to cater for the basic needs of his family.\r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan of 40,000 Kes through Juhudi Kilimo to purchase artificial insemination equipment for storing semen.

He says that he would like to own all kinds of artificial insemination equipment in future, acquire three motorcycles and employ three employees to enhance his profession.\r\n\r\nHe further comments that the cost of artificial insemination inputs is expensive hence farmers prefer to use the traditional bulls to service their animals.

U. is now requesting a new loan of 8,736,000 VND, which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital.  This will be her 3rd loan from SEDA.

Taking the support of my husband and my oldest son, I  opened my own shop. However, I have been through very hard times, and unfortunately I had to close my shop when I could not afford the rent. Back at home, I finished the remaining products by selling them to relatives, and I somehow managed to pay my debts.\" \r\n\r\n\"Just when I thought I was desperate, I discovered Maya. With the loans I borrowed from Maya, I bought new products from a wholesaler and I am back in business in my house. With the loans I borrowed from Maya, I can buy more products with a cheaper total price. My plans for the future are, if my affairs continue to go as fast and as well as they are going now, to open a shop--not in the city center but in a closer spot to my house--and to support my children and grandchildren as much as I can (by means of both financial and psychological support). My family is really important to me. I love my children and grandchildren so much.\"\r\n\r\nThis person\u2019s distinctive characteristics: an ambitious and unyielding woman.\r\n\r\nTranslated from Turkish by Maya Staff\r\n\r\n\r\nSadiye Han\u0131m 55 ya\u015f\u0131nda ve evli.D\u00f6rt \u00e7ocu\u011fu var.En k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fc\u011f\u00fc 23 ve en b\u00fcy\u00fc\u011f\u00fc 35 ya\u015f\u0131nda.Ticarete ba\u015flamadan \u00f6nce ev han\u0131m\u0131yd\u0131m 4 \u00e7ocuk b\u00fcy\u00fctm\u00fc\u015ft\u00fcm ama maddi s\u0131k\u0131nt\u0131lar i\u00e7inde zorlan\u0131rken az az mal al\u0131p  evde sat\u0131yordum.Daha sonra d\u00fckkan a\u00e7maya karar verdim ba\u015flarken e\u015fimin ve b\u00fcy\u00fck o\u011flumun deste\u011fini alarak d\u00fckkan a\u00e7t\u0131m.

My group members are: Koser B. needs a loan for their grocery store, Haneefan B. requires a loan for their restaurant, Sughran B. wants to invest loan in her embroidery business.

She is married and the mother of two children. Shahodat started her business because she needed extra income to be able to pay for household and personal expenses, and she also needed her own income in order to afford her home. She began 6 years ago selling clothing for kids and shoes. As she had always liked sales, it went well after the business was started, and she has continued selling clothing since then. With the purpose of expanding her business, she is requesting a loan of 600 USD, which she is promising to repay over 9 months. This way, Shahodat hopes to earn more and to meet her children\u2019s expenses.  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She uses her loans to procure goods.  She wants to repay the loan in eight months.  Her sales are good enough that she must restock often.

This was the experience of Manuela P. and her family when unavoidable circumstances forced them to move from the island of Panay to the village of Sitio Napulo, Barangay Cervantes, Escalante City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nWhen they lived in the Province of Iloilo, Manuela's husband earned his living through farming, but when they moved to Escalante, a seaside town where the main activity was fishing, they were like fish out of water. At first life was hard as they adjusted to their new life and new circumstances. Once they adapted to their new environment and assimilated into the local community, the couple started looking for better ways to support their family.\r\n\r\nOnce settled, she started making new friends in Escalante, and one of them invited her to do something that literally changed her life. When she said yes to her friend to attend an orientation at NWTF-Project Dungganon, Manuela opened a new door in her life. With 3 kids to raise and a family to support, she was receptive to new ideas, and when she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997, she decided to invest her first loan into a fishing business, because she observed that it provided a decent living for most of her neighbors. Even with no previous experience, the couple was able to make a go of this new venture, and they were able to payback the first loan.\r\n\r\nStriving hard to move out of poverty, they kept focus on their goals, and as the loan amounts available to them increased because of their good business practices and prompt payments, they were eventually able to buy a motorized fishing boat which allowed them to go farther out to sea. They also bought additional fishing nets and crab traps, increasing their income potential.\r\n\r\nThe business earns a net income of PHP 4,000 per month which helps a lot in supporting their family. She just paid off her previous loan of PHP 7,000, her 8th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, which she used to buy fishing tools. Now she is borrowing PHP 9,000 for her 9th loan cycle to repair their fishing boat and nets so that she and her husband can continue earning a livelihood for their family of five.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

She is a hard-working and enterprising mother who wants to get her children ahead.\r\n\r\nShe needs a loan to buy and sell merchandise like sweets, \u201cpanetones\u201d (an Italian sweet bread which is a Christmastime staple), cakes, and ice cream for the Christmas festivities.  That way she will be able to increase her business capital, have better income, and give her children a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful for the opportunity provided to her and promises to complete her payments on the respective due dates.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She is 42 years old and lives with her family in Karabalta, a provincial town. Because of unemployment, many residents left town for the capital Bishkek or to go abroad to find work.  In these conditions, Lilia and her husband could secure their own work. They are engaged in agriculture. You may know, the local climate and landscape are pleasantly agreeable for raising livestock and agricultural activities. Lilia inherited some livestock and already for the duration of 20 years raising animals has provided them a fundamental source of survival. Owing to the fact that she owns her livestock, Lilia was able to provide her children an education. Their older son is 19 years old. He works in a \u201cpelmeni\u201d (ravioli) shop. The younger son is 17 years old. For the time being, he is at home and is not working. Both Lilia\u2019s sons actively participate in tending the livestock. Therefore, Lilia does not encounter any sort of difficulty in her work. Lilia applied for a loan, in order to purchase gasoline and motor oil for working plots of land in the spring. They want to buy gasoline and motor oil now, because in the spring they will be significantly more expensive. \r\n\r\nKamza S. is 52 years old. His wife works as a schoolteacher.

She owns & operates a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  She has 3 years of experience in this business.    Pasikalia needs a loan of WST $2700 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 35 talas or US $15 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nPasikalia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Pasikalia's 7th loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:*               1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD :

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
