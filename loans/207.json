is a married woman who lives in Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 3 businesses: a sari-sari (general) store, a sugarcane plantation and a tricycle transport business. Her husband, Jeremiah P., 47 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have four children, aged 12 to 20 years old. \r\n\r\n<p>Lucia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and her own efforts, Lucia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 9,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000,  raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 19th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to buy stock for the general store in order to save up for the business' future expansion. Lucia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF:In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She says that she gets up very early every day to prepare the nixtamal (corn soaked in lime water) so that later she can go grind it and make the tortilla dough.\r\n\r\nAurora is asking for the loan to buy corn, firewood and lime powder and beans to make the sopesitos because they are stuffed.

He lives in a common-law marriage with Jessica who helps him attending the family business. They live in their own house with their four-year-old son. Heisen's activity consists in renting video games. He has installed four play stations at home, where he has a room with tables and chairs for the convenience of his customers. The booths are rented to neighbors and other people requesting his services. He told us that he learned this activity five years ago from his brothers who are also active in this business. Eventually he managed to save some money and used it as start capital for his own business, and now he and his partner attend it together. He likes his business because it gives him an income to cover household expenses and keeps him busy.\r\n\r\nNow his highest priority is to finish his education as a civil engineer and open a consulting business to draw up design plans.

They have a son and a daughter who are both in high school. They have contracted for this farm since January 2007 and have invested a lot of money in it. Every day she and her husband look after 800 ducks including egg-laying ducks and ducks for food, 25 pigs and a fish pond and a rice field of one hectare. However, she is still full of energy and plans. So she wants to borrow $1,200.00 to build a biogas plant ($430.00) to keep the environment clean and make the most of livestock manure. She will also use the loan to buy 25 breeding pigs and 800 chickens and ducks. As for payment, she is very confident and proud because she gets $6.5 per day from selling eggs, not to mention regular incomes from other livestocks. She says she doesn't fear hardship, she just dreams of having enough money to send her children to

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":270404,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy soda, juice, beer and biscuits","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-16T05:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":42692,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130757},{"amount":32.49,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":42692,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027545},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:41Z","rounded_local_amount":42692,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613546},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:44Z","rounded_local_amount":42692,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010625},{"amount":32.51,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":42692,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232911},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:25Z","rounded_local_amount":42692,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664706},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":42692,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105432},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:40Z","rounded_local_amount":42692,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022577},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":42692,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867826},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:33Z","rounded_local_amount":42691.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757027}],"funded_date":"2009-02-16T06:04:56Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":92680,"name":"Julia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \n\nJulia solo cuenta con el apoyo de los prestamos de EDAPROSPO desde hace un a\u00f1o; sin embargo, su negocio tiene ya veinte a\u00f1os en funcionamiento.

poor region located in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. She is applying for a loan of 300,000 colons, and this will be her first loan with Fundacion Mujer.<P>\r\n\r\nAt first glance, one would not be able to tell, but Jacqueline has a chronic illness called fibromyalgia, a virus affecting her muscular abilities. She has been sick for roughly 10 years. In order to fight the pain brought on by her illness, she takes up to 15 pills every day. The pills help; but the best therapy, she says, is her work. By staying busy with her candle-making, among other things, she can avoid taking so many pills, which leave her very tired and feeling weak. Jacqueline, or Jacky as it reads on her business cards, finds candle-making to be therapeutic as well as a means to generate income which helps pay household expenses and put her children through school. Her faith and her business are what get her out of bed every day and keep her motivated to take on life\u2019s challenges with an optimistic outlook.<P>\r\n\r\nJacky has eleven years' experience in the sales business; candle-making she has started relatively recently and has found it to be both profitable and rewarding. Jacky could not afford to take any formal candle-making classes, so she taught herself through trial and error. She can sell her candles for up to 8500 colons each. Her candles sell fast and she earns much more than she did working at the local mall.  In a 12 hour day, she used to earn 7,000 colons working in a shop. Selling her candles, she can earn up to 350,000 colones per month. It takes her 2 days to make 8 candles.<P>\r\n\r\nThis loan would be used to purchase raw materials and molds necessary for the creation of her beautiful candles. Recently, Jacky has received an abundance of orders for a specific type of candle she makes, with butterfly decorations. In order to respond to this surge in demand, she would like to purchase 2 more molds necessary to the creation of these candles. The molds cost 11,000 colons each. At the moment she has many different molds which she uses to create a variety of colorful, scented candles. This loan will help Jacqueline to take advantage of opportunities for increase sales associated with the Christmas season. <P>\r\n\r\nUnder the business name \u00a8Creaciones Jacky,\u00a8 Jacky and her son, Alonso, have put together a homemade catalog with pictures of the candles Jacky has created. When he isn\u2019t studying chemistry at the National University, Alonso helps his mother sell her products to shops in the nearby mall.<P>\r\n\r\nJacky is a true entrepreneur. Whether she is making candles, painting ceramics, promoting her products or taking care of the family, she is always doing something--and that\u00b4s the way she likes

The business is located on one of the main streets of the town, right in front of her house. Because of the financial difficulties that the family were facing--her husband\u2019s income didn\u2019t cover the family\u2019s expenses--Rosa decided to take advantage of the excellent location of the house and start a new business. Now she has many customers although sales are low. For this reason she would like a loan to buy eggs, candy, more fruit, plastic bags in which to put the fruit, and other items that she does not sell at the moment.

This is the physical location where  Luis C. O., 28, lives with his wife and 4-year-old son, and where he works buying and selling precious metals such as gold and silver.  He has been here for the last three years when he left his job as an employee in a jewelry store and went out on his own as a means of becoming self-supporting.\r\n\r\nHis business is based on buying and selling gold and silver by the gram bought from scrap merchants and suppliers, and that's how he makes his profit.  As always he needs available cash to be able to take advantage of the opportunities of the price fluctuations in the market of these metals.  He is requesting a loan from the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation which he will use to buy gold and silver from the recyclers and scrap merchants who are his best suppliers.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to continue his university studies but first he must succeed in becoming financially solvent with his jewelry business.  His most important goal is to spend time with his family but each day that is becoming more difficult.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Miriam Palacio, Kiva

She is 40 years old, married, and has two children. Gulshan puts a lot of enthusiasm into the development of her farming efforts and cattle breeding because she is aware that they can help her children.  \r\n\r\nShe sells fattened cattle to the local butchers and fruits to the local bazaar traders. Her monthly income is about $250-$315 and it is not enough to cover basic family needs.

She lives in her own house together with her husband Ernesto, age 49, and their 4 beloved children, for whom they would like to provide a better future. Lidia's farmlands are the best, and she keeps them well cared-for. Every day she gets up to make breakfast for her children who go to school. Later, she and her husband get ready to go out to the fields to cultivate their coffee, cacao, palillo [perfume guava] and barbasco plants, products which she later takes to sell in the wholesale centers located in the cities of San Francisco and Kimbiri. What she likes most about her work is the freedom she has to wander through the green fields of her village. She has been doing this work for 22 years, and she thinks the most difficult part is protecting her crops from the pests which attack the buds of the plants. With time, she would like to buy more land to increase her production.

E. is 19 years old, is a native of Bluefields, Nicaragua, and is single.  For a year has been making a living selling perfumes and other beauty products from the Selsa company.  This business functions as follows:  based on orders, a Selsa company representative sends beauty products to young G. on credit and she is responsible to sell these and to pay for the products, for which they pay her a commission of 30% on the sales.  In this way young Norma G. takes home this pay to help with the expenses of the house of her mother, who is a single parent.  Nonetheless her main problem is that her clients who are mainly women, buy these products on payment terms (in two and three twice-monthly or monthly payments), thus although G. is selling a lot of products, her commission is small. It should be mentioned that young G. only sells these products since the orders that she makes out are for products ordered in advance and she only needs to deliver them once they are sent to her.  It is for this that she needs a loan in order to buy these products which will permit her to make a profit of 60% on each item. She wants to buy:  4 bottles of Ferratt perfume at $10 each, 4 bottles of Mistery perfume at $50 each, 4 bottles of Esse perfume at $15 each, 4 bottles of papaya shampoo at $10 each, 6 containers of hair gel at $13 each, 4 dandruff shampoo at $11 each, 6 ladies\u2019 deodorants at $4 each, and 3 acne lotions at $13 each.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Diane Lister, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLa joven Norma G.

Este negocio funciona de la siguientes manera, una representante de la empresa Selsa le envia en base a solicitud productos de belleza a la joven G. al credito y esta se encarga de venderlo y cobrar el producto por lo cual le pagan una comision del 30 % sobre las ventas. De esta manera la joven Norma G. lleva este pago a su casa para ayudar en los gastos de la casa a su mama que es madre soltera. Sin embargo su problema  principale es que sus clientes que son mas  del genero femenino le compran estos productos con facilidades de pago (en dos y tres cuotas de pago quincenal y mensual), por lo que aun que vende bastantes productos, su comision es poca. Cabe mencionar que la joven G. vende estos productos ya que los pedidos que realiza son por encargos y solamente tiene que entregarlos una vez que se los envian. Es por esto que requiere de un financiamiento para poder comprar estos productos de los cuales les permite obtener una ganancia hasta del 60% por cada uno.

It is about a 45 minute drive from Sunyani, the regional capital. Ruth sells crates of eggs to make some income to support her family.

With their income from their business activities, they can provide the basic needs for their family.

For this, she is requesting to avail a loan amounting to PHP 5,000 for both the maintenance of their motorcycle transport and her livestock raising business. She also wants to start a rice vending business to earn extra income. However, Fely said that she cannot do all of these at the same time considering the availability of funds. Thus, she is praying that her loan will be approved to be able to make her business successful. She believes that all her business plans, if pursued, will be of big help to her family. She hopes to become successful in the business by being patient and by exerting more efforts in doing her work. According to her, she will only believe that she has already achieved her goals in life when she sees her children finish their studies in college and find a better job.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":321211,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":350814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of cereals in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-07-11T01:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gwantwa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:38Z","rounded_local_amount":71012.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73665064},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:49Z","rounded_local_amount":71012.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105776},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":71012.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022886},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:40Z","rounded_local_amount":71012.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868127},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:52Z","rounded_local_amount":71012.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757323},{"amount":54.15,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:47Z","rounded_local_amount":71012.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146417}],"funded_date":"2009-07-11T04:28:50Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":125464,"name":"Regina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Regina is a member of the Upendo North borrower group in Kinyanambo.

The official name of this borrowing group is \"Taguntungan Group.\"\r\n\r\nLerma is married and has 6 school-aged children. To make a living, Lerma raises and sells pigs.

Lerma is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be Lerma's first loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. It is also a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

At night she works in a small restaurant called Las Dos Torres where she prepares a variety of snacks.\r\n\r\nJulia is asking for a Lps. 7000 loan to buy a larger amount of clothes, especially those in season so that she can attract more customer attention and increase sales.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to own her own home and stop paying rent and to have a small store that will allow her to continue to earn income because she also has a grandson under her care and needs money to support her household.\r\n\r\nHer fellow group members are Lilian and Luisa.  Lilian sells clothes and shoes and also works at the Las Dos Torres restaurant but during days.  Luisa sells clothes and cosmetics.

Chirinzane was born on the 2nd of March, 1959, in Xai Xai in the Gaza province.  She attended school only until the 5th grade because her parents lacked the resources to support her studies. At 10 years old, she and her parents moved to Maputo, to where her father's work was transferred. At 19 years old, her father died, and she was left to live with her mother. Life became extremely difficult. At the age of 22, she and her husband moved in together. Since her husband's salary was insufficient, in 1999 she started selling wood. Through a friend, she came to know Hluvuku and asked for a loan of 800 dollars to purchase more wood in order to increase the volume of her sales. <p> This business has made a positive and visible impact on this family. It has allowed them to rent an apartment and purchase a vehicle, which her husband uses for his taxi service. The community has been impacted also by this business, which supplies quality wood for the production of furniture and construction of houses. In the future, after fortifying her business with the loan, she intends to construct a house for her children. <p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nAtalia

Her parents-in law used to keep cattle and left the cattle to her and her husband as an inheritance. That\u2019s how Burul appeared to have inherited not only the cattle but also a way of earning a livelihood.\r\n\r\nBurul and her husband have raised five children. Her three daughters are already married and live separately. One of her sons, married, plays in a team in a traditional game of \u201cpulling a kid\u201d. He also lives apart from his parents. The youngest son is thirty. He does odd jobs at a factory in the capital but still lives with his parents.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her age, 54, Burul eagerly manages her living herself. She sells twenty liters of milk per day and these days she is occupied with harvesting wheat. If her annual income was averaged, her monthly income would constitute $125.\r\n\r\nBurul has applied for this loan to purchase some sheep to raise and resell. Her dream is to buy accommodation for her eldest son in the capital.\r\n\r\nBurul has three partners: Cholponbai, Nestana and Begaiym:\r\n\r\nCholponbai, 47, is the father of two children. His wife carries goods to Russia. As to Cholponbai, he trades in cattle. His son, 22, is a taxi-driver and his daughter is a high school student. Cholponbai needs a loan to purchase two calves. His dream is to have Mercedes. But first he is going to see his son married.\r\n\r\nNestana, 20, is married and her husband works as a social worker. She raises cattle which is quite courageous of her, since she is just twenty. She invested $465 in this business, which is quite a sum for anybody in this area. She needs a loan to purchase a calf to raise and resell and another calf for breeding.\r\n\r\nBegaiym, 35, is married and has five children. Her husband produces sun-dried bricks, whereas Begaiym sells milk - nine liters per day. She needs a loan to buy a calf. Selling milk brings her $63 a month.

Occ. She is 43 years old. Marilou is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Marilou owns & operates a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing manicure and pedicure services in the local community. Marilou has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Marilou joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marilou is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Marilou from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":449738,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to purchase things for her manicure\/pedicure salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Magcamiguing, Calamba Mis.

Alice has been in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 6,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month.<p>In 2009, Alice joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living conditions and enable her to engage in business activities. Alice is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used as additional capital for her business. This will be her second loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue to supplement her family's income.<p>Alice is the leader of a 10 member group accessing a loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members, if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She buys these second-hand clothes from Owino Market, one of the busiest markets in Kampala city, and so incurs transport costs to and from buying her wares. She receives an average of 40 customers a day. She has done this business for over 20 years. Her main challenges are defaulters, the rainy season (because she works from a muddy place) and the ever increasing price of used clothes. She sells on a retail basis only.\r\n\r\nShe has been with Kiva's partner MCDT for over 10 years and is servicing her 30th loan, working all this time with the same group mates. She wants to use this loan to buy more bales of second-hand clothes. She is aspiring to see her business grow bigger and to start selling on a wholesale basis only.

This story is connected to one particular individual in Bushenyi district, western Uganda, who goes by the name of T. Jackson.\n\nThis 50-year-old married gentleman has subsisted on his banana plantation for the last thirty-eight years. Though adverse weather conditions have constantly affected his gardens, he has managed to consolidate the gains he has made. As a result his family of seven have enjoyed the benefits. Principally, his children all now attend good institutions of higher learning.\n\nJackson gleefully reveals he makes close to or even more than 250,000 shillings a month from selling bananas. He is very upbeat that with this loan he will be in position to improve on the mulching and gardening aspects of his business.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":521478,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To pay for enhancements to his farm, principally improved mulching methods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Bushenyi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.416667 30.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-04-12T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jackson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:49:47Z","rounded_local_amount":152809.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144767251},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":152809.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662272},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:47:18Z","rounded_local_amount":152809.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689045},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:00Z","rounded_local_amount":152809.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903275},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":152809.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172296844},{"amount":145,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":305618.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605369},{"amount":145,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:06:49Z","rounded_local_amount":305618.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191482795},{"amount":72.5,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:59:35Z","rounded_local_amount":152809.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195909568}],"funded_date":"2010-04-13T02:40:29Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:59:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":195988,"name":"Hanna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hanna is married and blessed with three children who are in school.

Aun as\u00ed ella quiere lograr mayor  independencia,  por eso solicita un cr\u00e9dito  por valor de $2.000.000 para comprar la suya propia y mejorar la calidad de la puntada, porque cuando trabaja en su casa lo hace con una de pedal, \"la negrita zz\". \t\nLeidi hace de todo un poco, es decir maneja  la confecci\u00f3n  en l\u00ednea femenina, infantil y masculina, pero tambi\u00e9n vende mercanc\u00edas como cobijas, maletines, termos, maquinas de reposter\u00eda, abanicos y perfumes y as\u00ed mismo elabora pasteles los fines de semana y en fechas especiales, porque ha hecho muchos cursos de culinaria y reposter\u00eda.

C. lives in the Santuario neighborhood of the city of Barranquilla; she has a 17 year old daughter.  Leidi makes women's clothing and works part-time as an employee of a clothing factory where they lend her a sewing machine so she can work on her own business during her free time.  Still she would like to become more independent which is why she is seeking a $1025 loan to buy her own machine and improve the quality of the stitching because when she works out of her home, she sews with a foot-pedal machine she calls, \"the little black zz.\"\r\n\r\nLeidi does a little of everything--she makes clothes for men, women and children but she also sells such items as blankets, backpacks, thermoses, pastry appliances, fans, and perfumes; at the same time she makes pastries on the weekends and on holidays as she has taken a number of cooking and baking classes.  Her husband is retired from the police department and her daughter is majoring in marketing and sales in the SENA while learning English in an academy.  Leidi's primary customers are her family, her friends and police offers who were old colleagues of her husband.  Though she has worked in this business for 9 years ever since she took her classes, this is her first loan through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo.  She was referred by a number of people who benefitted greatly from the foundation; she hopes that the loan will help her to increase her capital and to get better pricing on her shipments.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to someday have a car and that her daughter studies in the university.  She lives with her husband in Santuario, an old and popular neighborhood of Barranquilla; she feels content because she has many services nearby such as the police and health clinics.  She lives near the Metropolitan Stadium where the professional Colombian soccer teams play and near the home of Junior de Barranquilla.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva

He lives with his wife Jenny, age 28, and their two children Javier and Ruth (ages 5 and 2 respectively).  They have their own home where they live in harmony.  Joel works on his land where he grows cacao, coffee, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lonchocarpus_urucu\" target=\"_blank\" >barbasco<\/a>, and pineapple.  He has a total of three hectares of land on which he cultivates his crops.  His parents taught him how to farm and now he has his own land that he bought with the savings he accumulated.  Joel knows how to hard.  He has been farming for nine years and has the help of workers during the harvest season who are in charge of collecting the produce so that it can be sold later.  Joel is very committed to his work and today he gets to enjoy the fruits of his labor.  Although he generates good earnings, he is not pleased with the winter season because of the large population of insects that are present during these months that could harm his crops.  The loan he is requesting will be used to buy pineapple seedlings to plant in place of coffee since these fruits generate more income in less time.

He makes his living through agriculture because he enjoys working in the fields. He learned this work as a child, thanks to his parents' teaching. Lauro has his own plots of land, where he sows corn and rice. Throughout the years, he has had to confront challenges such as plagues, low prices, and lack of labourers.\r\n\r\nLauro is an admirable family man. Because of her job, Jojita had to move to the city, so Lauro takes care of the children. He does all the cooking and cleaning as if it were nothing, on top of working in the fields. With the help of labourers, who he pays by the day for their labour, Lauro is able to speed up his agricultural chores. His sales are considerable in May. During that time of the year, the price of rice is around 11 Pesos per kilo. This is very good for him and his family. \r\n\r\nLauro is requesting a loan of PHP 15,000 to buy seed and fertilizer for his farm business. Lauro dreams to buy transportation services.

This is 40-year-old Zamda S. from Mbeya. She is married with four children between the ages of 10 and 25. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent who is an orphan because her parents died of HIV. \r\n\r\nZamda has been running a \u201cgenge\u201d business since 2002. A genge (grocery store) is usually a very basic structure made of wood with a tin roof, where general items such as onions, tomatoes, chili, oil, rice and dried fish are sold. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for nine to 12 hours per day, seven days per week. Zamda currently earns about $90 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase additional stock of rice, sugar, salt, cooking oil and soda. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and range of her business and to open the same business at new location.\r\n\r\nZamda  thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":350840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stock of rice, sugar, salt, cooking oil and soda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-07-11T04:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zamda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":103787.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73665069},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:38Z","rounded_local_amount":103787.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105781},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":103787.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022891},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":103787.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868132},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:47Z","rounded_local_amount":103787.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757328},{"amount":79.15,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:45Z","rounded_local_amount":103787.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146422}],"funded_date":"2009-07-12T22:34:21Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":125496,"name":"Monica's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Monica L., 36, is a very hard-working lady and a widow with 6 children of whom 5 are still in school.

At her age, she still wants to be productive and help her children, grandchildren and other relatives get out of poverty as much as she can. She started first with a variety store. With her subsequent loans, she was able to raise pigs and sell them after four months. Return on this kind of business is double the amount of her capital. With this profit and another loan, she was able to venture into financing farmers who grow rice. During harvest, the farmers she financed will give her a certain amount of rice depending on their price agreement. Rice paid to her will be sold in her variety store. Profits from these ventures have enabled her to pay her weekly payment to ASHI on time and maintain her business.\r\n\r\nNow Anesia wants to take a bigger loan to enhance her business more. Although she is a new businesswoman, she has seen her profit and productivity grow, and so she is seeking more capital to achieve her dreams for her business and family.\r\n\r\nOut of her profits,

The live in a house they own in San Francisco, a town in the beautiful Cusco countryside.  Santa didn't finish elementary school, but that hasn't been an obstacle for her because she works hard and knows how to overcome the barriers in her way.  She remembers starting with nothing more than a small store, selling cold drinks, and building it bit by bit until she saved enough to add a second floor to her house.  Now she has another house in the town of Quimbiri.  She also earns money from farming and, specifically, from growing cocoa, now her main source of income.  Normally, she tends the crop herself but she hires laborers to help her during the harvest season.  Her partner works as a driver and generates an income that goes to paying the family's bills.  Santa's crop usually sells for a good price at her town's local warehouse.  For the future, she would like to open a motorcycle repair shop because her partner, who studied to be a mechanic, can run it.  This is Santa's eighth MFP loan and she is committed to repaying this one on time, just as she has past loans.  She gains strength from the other members of the community bank and values the honesty of the group.

They are eager to improve their situation. They live in a humble dwelling located in a very crowded neighborhood to the north of the city. She remembers how she started her business marketing engine oil and coolants for cars, which were sold wholesale. She used to buy these products in large drums and sold them at retail price to regular customers. But, for the past 4 years she has sold individual retail goods and says that in this way she can earn a regular income. At the same time as running this business, she also sells beauty products from a catalog. She sells to people that she knows as the products are sold on credit and she needs to be sure she can always make the payments. She likes her work because it brings in good income and makes it possible for her to give the best to her daughters. As she is a woman who is eager to get ahead, she has plans to increase the amount of merchandise she carries, as she has regular customers who buy her products. This is the first loan she has had from MFP, and she promises to make her repayments punctually. In addition, she does not want to disappoint the people who made the loan possible and are helping her to keep working. Juana plans to use the loan to buy a greater quantity of oils and coolants for cars, as she that she can offer more variety to her clients. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Alison Hynd, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":595072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To stock-up on oil and other products for vehicles.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Valijon has always been hard-working and committed to ensure that his family never goes without its daily bread. He is married, has two children, and runs a grocery store where he sells different kinds of foods. With starting capital of $500, Valijon opened his shop 10 years ago. Since that time, it has continually expanded to the point where his wife (seen here in the photo) also helps out in the shop. Valijon has applied for a loan of $1,000 to buy additional products to sell in his store. He wants prospective lenders to know that he is ready to work even harder and make sacrifices  to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur. We believe his perseverance and clear vision will be key success factors in his small business.   \r\n    \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule and famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This business has produced good returns and provides her with the money to give her children a good education.

Negros Occidental. She earns her living by running a general store and selling food. Roselyn has 2 school-age children. The children go to school and also help in the business as part of their daily chores. She wants her children to finish their studies and to improve their living conditions.\n\nRoselyn joined NWTF-Project  Dungganon in 1996 in the hope that she would be able to  improve her family's quality of life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase her family's income. Now she earns an average monthly income of  Php 4,000 from her business activities.\n\nRoselyn is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of Php 19,500 was used to fund operations of her general store, and had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now, she is requesting her 15th loan, in the amount of Php 19,500, which she intends to use for her general store and food vending. Roselyn is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\n\nAbout NWTF:\n  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":448696,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Additional working capital for general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Binalbagan, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roselyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":19500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":780},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":780}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":119,"local_amount":5460,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:14:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5486.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129189},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3135.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965986},{"amount":85,"local_amount":3900,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":3918.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997897},{"amount":68,"local_amount":3120,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:45:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3135.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136722577},{"amount":85,"local_amount":3900,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3918.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144755857}],"funded_date":"2010-01-04T03:33:58Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:42:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deborah Kerman","image":193796}},{"id":166757,"name":"Aliyu Rose Mary Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose M. is the group representative.

She is 29 years old, married, and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Emma owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making snacks and other delicacies and selling them in the local community through peddling. Emma has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 3,500 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Emma joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to purchase additional materials, such as plastic containers and ingredients needed to make the snack food, and was also used as working capital. Emma is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make more snack food for sale. This loan will be her third from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

There she formed her family with Santiago, her husband of ten years.  Together they have two children: Leslie and Jefferson, who they care for in their own home.  She is a female leader with many qualities.  Her main difficulties are the lack of working capital and the remoteness of her area, so she partnered with several women like her to create a community bank, where they can move ahead with the financial support it offers them.  \r\n\r\nHer main economic activity is farming.  She plants corn and bananas in the two fields she rents during the year.  The thing she likes best about her work is coffee harvest time, because she earns a good income during that time.  She says she travels to different places where she looks for laborers to help with the grain collection.  Since she is skillful, she pays them very well for each arroba (unit of weight between 24 and 36 pounds) they collect.
