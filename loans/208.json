She is a married mother of three children. All her children are in school in the community where they live. She and her husband and children live together. She works hard to provide food and school fees for the children. She is a qualified teA. and this has given her the opportunity to understand the importance of education. She is providing all educational support to the children. In spite of the challenges she faces, she has been a baker for 12 years. Using flour for her production, she prepares bread and sells it to her customers. She supplies bread by herself in the market center to her customers. And people also come to her to buy. Her only problem now has to do with adequate funds to buy raw materials as prices are going up.

Economic necessity pushed her into clothing sales.  She has three young school-age daughters who depend upon her economically.  For this reason, she, together with her husband, sells gas and chickens in the local market near her home.  With her first 300 sol loan she bought gas at wholesale to begin her sales.  With this 300 new sol loan she will buy chickens to sell in the market thereby earning profits sufficient to cover her daughters' needs.

In meetings, they demonstrate that they are active and unified people. Amongst the things they do, we can mention the sale of cosmetics, food sales, sausage production, meat sales, sandals, men that work as bricklayers, and passenger transportation within the neighborhood of Portachuelo. The competition is really quite difficult, especially in food and cosmetic sales, so that every member hopes every day to increase her sales. There is high competition, so the members don\u2019t have permanent shops. Instead, they travel for their sales so that they can make higher earnings throughout the day. The loan is for the purchase of merchandise to increase their sales, as well as the purchase of consumables for food sales, the repair of vehicles, and those that are bricklayers want to purchase tools of their trade to speed up their work and generate better incomes for their children. A majority of the members are new and are already familiar with the product. They are enthusiastic about the economic help, as many of them have big projects that they want to realize in the future and know that if they complete their payment responsibly, they can count on the support of the foundation whenever they will need it. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Towle, Kiva

Aida has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP monthly whenever she sells a pig she has raised.\nIn 2010, Aida joined Kiva partner, ASKI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. Aida is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future. This loan will be her second from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \n\nAbout ASKI\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her mother also lives with them and acts as her right hand when taking care of the home and managing her business.  Zoila and her family reside in Tonacatepeque, which is located in the city of San Salvador.  She is a responsible and hardworking mother.  Even though she must assume the role of both father and mother, she has been able to move her family forward and provide everything her children need for their studies.  All of this has been made possible thanks to Zoila\u2019s tremendous efforts.  She has a store where she sells food products such as bread and candy.  Her inventory also includes basic necessities such as soap and shampoo.  She also makes tortillas every day at noon and sells vegetables outside of house.    Her mother helps with managing the business and making tortillas.  Their efforts have helped her businesses remain stable.\r\n<p>\r\nZoila is requesting a loan so that she can restock her store, as well as buy corn in bulk and vegetables so that she can provide better service to her customers.  To help her family succeed, she seeks to improve her sales as a priority.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Reynaldo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to expand services provided. Reynaldo is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP, which will be used to repair the vehicle used in the business. This loan will be the 10th loan taken out by Reynaldo from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand his business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":659412,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

She earns her living by operating a transportation (tricycle) business.  Her husband Rodolfo, Sr., who is 58 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children who are 8 to 27 years old. Elna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to repair the sidecar of her tricycle so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.  Elna is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Her husband died when she had just given birth to their third child. She was left with the sole responsibility of providing for herself and her children. It was not an easy task for a woman in Uganda, but she was determined to obtain a job as a housekeeper in Kampala. It was through this job that she was introduced to Life in Africa. She has been an active member for the last six years.\r\n<p>\r\nZarina was forced to leave school at a very early age due to the civil war. Her family lost everything during this conflict and she was never able to return to school. This left her with poor English skills, and she was barely able to read or write. However, she knew the values of education, and she has made it her life\u2018s goal to make sure that her children are all educated. This goal prompted her to look for a way to secure their future.\r\n<br><br>\r\nZarina proved to be a smart business woman, and she saw the advantage of investing in income property. She managed to secure several loans through Life in Africa, and she built a solid housing unit in a poor section of Kampala. She has several tenants living in her property now, and she was able to pay back all her loans in a timely manner. Like any other Life in Africa member, she was among the first to take a loan of 800,000 from Kiva in May 2006.  She used her loan money to plaster her house, which ensured the quality of housing for her tenants. In addition, it also insured the value and durability of her property. She has repaid her loans without ever having a single late payment. Before plastering her house, she was earning 200,000 per month and is now earning 280,000 per month.\r\n<p>\r\nZarina feels that she should put a ceiling board in her four roomed house so that it may look attractive to her tenants and also may increase the house rent. Any additions to the house increase the rent, which would raise her income. To do this she is requesting a loan amount of 150 USD."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":36976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Putting a celing board in the house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kyebando, Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":8,"posted_date":"2007-05-21T01:11:58Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zarina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-04T03:02:25Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-06-29T09:15:12Z","settlement_date":"2007-08-29T22:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26808},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-07-29T09:15:20Z","settlement_date":"2007-08-29T22:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36402},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2007-08-29T09:15:18Z","settlement_date":"2007-08-29T22:17:10Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47535}],"funded_date":"2007-05-21T03:02:25Z","paid_date":"2007-08-29T09:15:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14540,"name":"Anonymous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":""}},"status":"defaulted","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":726677,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Jane Kisai would like to purchase two steers.","delinquent":true,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":6,"posted_date":"2007-07-21T14:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-08-05T01:08:32Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":375,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2007-07-22T01:08:32Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":18636,"name":"Ni Ketut Kasih","description":{"languages":["id"],"texts":{"id":"Ketut Kasih is a Pig Farmer who is dtermine and hardworking to help her husband who is a farmer to provide food on the table.

She lives in her own house with her only son, Ronald, who is 24.  Every day she makes miniature handicrafts, which she sells by traveling around the streets of the city of Puno.  She hand-makes replicas of bottles of milk, sacks of flour, bags of cement, sacks of rice, and many other things, but always in very small sizes, because in Puno they believe that if you buy these things in miniature, they will turn into the real thing.\r\n\r\nGregoria really likes her work because it's really fun and she feels like she's playing.  She has been doing this for 15 years and wants to be able to export her products to other countries to increase her income.  The hardest part of her work is that she has to do everything by hand, so it takes a long time to make enough merchandise to go out and sell.\r\n\r\nThis will be Gregoria's first loan with MFP.  She knows she has to make all of her payments on time, and she is willing to do so.  She is very happy with her village bank and is always joking around with the other members.  She plans to use the 900 soles she is requesting to buy the materials she needs to make her miniature crafts, and she is hoping to expand her current sales.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":290912,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials to make her handicrafts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T16:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":158.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117300},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:54Z","rounded_local_amount":158.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012252},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:41Z","rounded_local_amount":158.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595834},{"amount":150,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:33Z","rounded_local_amount":474.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990101}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T17:51:29Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":100580,"name":"Febe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Febe B. is currently engaging in a sari-sari (convenience store) business.

Dymphna is striving hard to grow her business in order to save some of her earnings to buy a tricycle for her husband.

Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to purchase raw materials for her restaurant so that she can continue to save up for the future and her children's education.

Like all single mothers, she works to care for her daughter, Dennis, of 4 years, who she takes care of and educates in her parents house; located in the rural area of Santa Clara. Her main aspiration is to build her own house, so that she can provide the commodities necessary for her small daughter. Because of this, she works eagerly every morning on her crops. She has worked in agriculture for 3 years, the potato crop being her main activity so that different varieties of the same crop can be sold throughout the year without \"major difficulties\", she says.

The group members sell products such as cereals (this is the case for Baya who is standing on the far left of the photo with a plastic bowl of rice in her hand), bed sheets, fruits (bananas and mangos) and firewood.\r\n\r\nAs they need to increase their working capital, the group members have joined Soro Yiriwaso's loan program and are on their seventh solidarity loan.\r\n\r\nBaya is renowned in Hamdallaye for the sale of her high quality cereals at the Ch\u00e2teau market in S\u00e9gou. She is planning to use her loan to buy three sacks of rice from the Niono fairpeople at S\u00e9gou's Grand Market. She resells the rice for cash and on credit from her home and at the Ch\u00e2teau market to a customer base made up of men and women.\r\n\r\nWith this loan Baya is hoping to make an average monthly profit of 25,000FCFA, which will be used to reinvest in her business and to provide for small household necessities. Her ambition is through this relationship with Soro Yiriwaso to become a wholesaler.

The family had rented a small store for Ghulam, which he tended to full-time, 7 days a week.  The business went well and Ghulam was soon able to purchase that store.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter the fall of the Taliban, Ghulam and his family decided to return to their homeland, Afghanistan.  They are residents of the eastern Ningarhar province.  Ghulam is pursuing the same business of retail in Afghanistan, but the business is not going well because the inventory is too small for his clientele.  \r\n<p>\r\nGhulam S. hopes to expand his business and therefore his profitability by increasing his store inventory.  Increase of inventory will also make the business interesting as he is bored and almost fed up with the size of the business he has right now.  Sayed Ghulam S. has applied for a 50,000 Afghanis loan to achieve this goal.  Ghulam hopes that by increasing his business, he will be able to support his family, send his siblings to school, and watch them become doctors and

One of them is Karla Patricia G. M., who has a small grocery store.  Rosa Argentina M. A. has sold clothing, frozen treats, beer, ice and prepared meals for the last 28 years; this has allowed her to raise her children successfully.  She tells us that her business does well but, on a personal front, she was weighed down by the fact that her son did not have any contact with his daughter, who asked about him a lot.  However, thanks to God, she managed to reunite them this Christmas and they have begun to have a better relationship with each other.  Carolina L. makes and sells tortillas and nacatamales (steamed maize dumpling with savory filling, wrapped in a banana leaf) on weekends, an activity that has gradually been growing and improving her quality of life.  She is a strong woman who has suffered much by the fact that she has never been able to care for her oldest daughter because, having had her when she was very young, her parents decided to give the child to a relative to raise.

She owns a store, which is going very well for her. She is receiving good economic returns, and she does not regret going into this field for anything in the world. She even has loyal customers who always shop in her store. She receives help from her children in general, but normally she works on her own; her daily routine starts at 6:00 a.m and continues until 10:00 at night. Her shop is located in front of the main park in her town. However, she is thinking of expanding her store so that she can sell wholesale and thus generate a good profit margin. This is her fourteenth loan with MFP, and she is committed to continue paying throughout the established time period. She also feels very happy with the members of her communal bank, thanks to the responsibility and punctuality they demonstrate in their payments.

She also has \r\nmany pending orders for these items.\r\n\r\nBut what she likes best about her business is the contact she has with people because this distracts her.  Her greatest wish is to have a sewing workshop equipped with industrial sewing machines that produce impeccable finishings so that she can make items in quantity thus expanding her business.\r\n\r\nThis is her 21st loan with MFP and she pledges to repay all her installments on time like she\u2019s been doing to date.

Bungyod, Brgy. Matab-ang, Talisay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating a general store and a ready-to-wear clothes business. Her husband Jimmy, who is 54 years old, works as a carpenter and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have eight children between nine and 23 years old. \r\n\r\nAngelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Angelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus raising the family's standard of living.  For her fifth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy more inventory for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Angelita D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She earns her living by operating a buy and sell of ginger and vegetables business.  Her husband Jose Ariel, who is 34 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have two children who are 6 and 9 years old.  Ma. Gina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Gina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow.  Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to use as funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future of her children's education.  Ma. Gina is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. The picture was taken at the back of her house where she stores the ginger that is to be delivered to her buyers.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Together they live their own house. For more than 20 years she has been working in agriculture, a business her family had engaged in for years. Without a doubt, it is not enough to support the household. For this reason she had to open a store using the savings she had. Since then she opens the doors to her store first thing in the morning, offering a variety of essential products. The friendliness with which she greets her customers has been a great boon to her sales. She has been in this business for 10 years and she says that she will continue working hard to build up her business.

She spends her days with her common-law husband, working together and sharing moments of joy.\r\n\r\nHer work consists of planting and harvesting different types of regional produce.  Every week she travels via the river Ucayali to a community that is very far away called Cunchuri.  This is where she has a pond and plants bananas, corn, beans and other crops on the good land that she has.  She has been doing this work for ten years and receives help in this from her common-law husband.\r\nWhen she started this work it was a little difficult for her since she did not have the knowledge necessary to become a good farmer.  However, with a lot of training and determination to improve her situation, she was able to learn the necessary skills, and now her land produces crops of good quality that are highly sought-after in the city.\r\n\r\nApart from having a good income, she enjoys very much being able to be out in nature and see her crops grow.

The little store has been operating for seven years, but only  in the last year (using Friendship Bridge credit) did they acquire a refrigerator so they can offer cold drinks. The refrigerator is now paid off completely.  \r\n<br\/><br\/>\r\nAna Leticia is on her 5th loan, having grown her credit to where she can ask for 2500 Guatemalan Quetzals, which will be used for inventory for the store.

is a middle-aged woman who lives with her four children and one grandson in a community on the outskirts of the capital of Santo Domingo. She has struggled for a long time to provide for her children, and ever since she and her husband separated, she has essentially been their sole provider.\r\n\r\nSanta currently has a small business where she collects glass soda and beer bottles from restaurants and the streets, and then sells them back to their respective companies. Typically she gets paid a flat rate per pound for her bottles; however, with the help of this loan, two very important things will happen. First, she will be able to begin buying bottles from some of the local colmados (corner stores) at a very low rate so that she can turn a higher profit each week. After a few months of the increased profits, she will have enough money saved so that she can submit her paperwork to obtain a legal ID number in the Dominican Republic. Consequently this will help her further, because recognized and legal Dominican residents get paid a higher rate, per pound, for recycled glass material.\r\n\r\nSanta is very grateful to everyone who is helping her to make this loan happen.

In 1985 at the age of 15, she got involved in the world of micro-enterprises.  She had started her business with $50 in initial capital, which had enabled her to buy salted fish to sell.  Her business prospered through 1990.  The political and economic instabilities of the 90\u2019s disrupted her work leading to a drop in business.   In 2000, Kilolo started up again selling used clothing, and she diversified a few years later by including the sale of spices, which she sells today. \r\n\r\nKilolo decided to join a HOPE RDC group named \u201cJoyeux Lutins\u201d in 2008, with the goal of opening a clothing store one day.  She is a loyal client who has received HOPE RDC loans and who has totally repaid them on time.  The last loan she had was used to buy ten trays of eggs, as well as spices to sell in order to grow her revenues.  \r\n\r\nKilolo is divorced and is the mother of four children, ranging in age from 6 to 17.  Three of them are students.  One is in secondary school, and two are in primary school.  Currently, her capital amounts to $100.  Her business generates for her a profit of $48 each week.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4350,"image":{"id":339761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy ten trays of eggs and some spices to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

This confidence is an advantage in increasing her income.  It allows her to update the utensils and machines that she uses to make her delicious snacks.\r\n\r\nNow, Rosa hopes to install in her house a space equipped with all of her indispensable working materials.  She wants to do this to work comfortably and increase her production in order to distribute cakes to some of the stores in her district.\r\n\r\nCooperation and optimism are the characteristics that describe the colleagues she works with in her community bank.  They have had nine loans with Microfinanzas PRISMA, and each time they improve their incomes.  The 2,000 PEN that she is asking for is to buy utensils and another oven to increase her production.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She currently lives with her three children. Two of her children are in college and the eldest is already working.

However, her refrigerator was damaged by the recent flood that hit the entire Manila area, so she has to stop her frozen meat products business for a while because she has nowhere to store her products.  Then she got a loan from the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in the amount of P17,000.00, which she used to start a small sari-sari (general) store.  She now earns more than P10,000.00 a month from the combined earnings of her new business and her earnings from the rickshaw.\r\n\r\nShe is working hard to be able to get back her former sources of income.  When her children finish their college education and are able to get decent jobs, Romana wants to go back to the province and stay there for good.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She hopes they bring her economic support to improve the conditions of her entire family.  \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":662893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase clothes and shoes for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-12-12T11:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariluz Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2011-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.77},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.58,"local_amount":591.57,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:47:28Z","rounded_local_amount":645.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191349084},{"amount":27.98,"local_amount":559.53,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":610.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766750},{"amount":27.98,"local_amount":559.66,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:57:48Z","rounded_local_amount":610.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209794},{"amount":28,"local_amount":560.05,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T09:58:44Z","rounded_local_amount":611.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206078598},{"amount":27.86,"local_amount":557.24,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":607.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211147647},{"amount":27.9,"local_amount":557.96,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":608.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216433183},{"amount":28.1,"local_amount":561.9,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":613.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221598162},{"amount":52.6,"local_amount":1052.09,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1147.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226967876}],"funded_date":"2010-12-17T21:50:56Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T08:09:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa C","image":null}},{"id":261257,"name":"Eugenia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eugenia C. is a married woman who lives in  Brgy. Jolomaynon, Dalaguete, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a vegetable-farming business. Her husband, Magno, who is 53 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are from 19 to 30 years old. \r\n\r\nEugenia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Eugenia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use for additional capital for the vegetable farm so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children. \r\n\r\nEugenia C. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Gracias a su destreza y habilidades en este campo textil trabaj\u00f3 en una tienda muy conocida en la zona, pero eso causaba el descuido de su vivienda, ahora abri\u00f3 su propia textiler\u00eda en casa de su hermana y  esta  aprovechando al m\u00e1ximo esta oportunidad  ya que tiene una buena clientela.Para ella la \u00fanica forma de vivir tranquila sin preocupaciones es trabajando y por esa raz\u00f3n anhela establecer su propia empresa textil y para ello necesita de un capital de dinero que le permita adquirir las herramientas necesarias para poner en marcha su proyecto.Apoyemos a esta madre que con talento y esfuerzo sigue trabajando arduamente para progresar."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":95066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of materials for manufacture (Lace, cloth, buttons, clasps, etc)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-12-08T17:15:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-22T19:49:36Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71,"local_amount":200.47,"processed_date":"2008-01-22T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:25:05Z","rounded_local_amount":212.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":120139},{"amount":71,"local_amount":200.47,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:25:05Z","rounded_local_amount":212.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140305},{"amount":71,"local_amount":200.47,"processed_date":"2008-03-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:25:05Z","rounded_local_amount":212.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":163876},{"amount":71,"local_amount":200.47,"processed_date":"2008-04-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:25:05Z","rounded_local_amount":212.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188865},{"amount":71,"local_amount":200.47,"processed_date":"2008-05-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:25:05Z","rounded_local_amount":212.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216802},{"amount":70,"local_amount":197.65,"processed_date":"2008-06-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-22T09:25:05Z","rounded_local_amount":209.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245721}],"funded_date":"2007-12-08T19:49:36Z","paid_date":"2008-06-22T09:09:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":30973,"name":"Thi Thuynh","description":{"languages":["vi"],"texts":{"vi":"Ms Thuynh is 50 years old, she has 2 children who are working.

She sells vegetables in the May 12 market, which is one of the busiest in the zone of Mi Per\u00fa, where she lives. Epifania has been working in this business for 15 years, during which time she has gained a lot of experience with which she can conduct her work with a lot of efficiency. What she likes most about her work is the interaction she has with people, because she is very kind in her dealings with her clients. Because she works from 7 in the morning until 6 in the evening, she gets very tired. In the summer, the heat is unbearable and in the winter, the cold doesn\u2019t allow her to conduct her business as she would like to. Happily, she has learned to fight against these setbacks, because she is a very strong and hard-working woman. Now she wants to expand her stand, by buying more vegetables and renovate it to make it more attractive to her clients. Epifania is an old and very faithful client of Microfinanzas PRISMA, and this is her first individual loan, since before, she was involved in community banks. With the money that she requests, she wants to supply her stand with more vegetables. She will also hire a builder so that she can fix her stand so that it will look better and so that she will be more comfortable when she sells. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":310021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase her merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-28T12:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Epifania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":197.4},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":205.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":217.59},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":223.07},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":232.29},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":244.51},{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":254.28},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":262.53},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":274.96},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":285.96},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":297.4},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":304.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.16},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.81},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.72},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.49},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.47},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.64},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.32},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.36},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.94},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.8,"local_amount":205.54,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:03Z","rounded_local_amount":207.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596166},{"amount":80.79,"local_amount":248.57,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":250.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990441},{"amount":72.24,"local_amount":222.27,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:32Z","rounded_local_amount":224.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211556},{"amount":74.78,"local_amount":230.08,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:53Z","rounded_local_amount":232.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641060},{"amount":79.11,"local_amount":243.42,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:52Z","rounded_local_amount":245.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080520},{"amount":78.66,"local_amount":242.03,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:18:33Z","rounded_local_amount":244.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996665},{"amount":83.43,"local_amount":256.7,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:22Z","rounded_local_amount":259.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842151},{"amount":439.19,"local_amount":1351.39,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-16T10:46:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1363.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733810}],"funded_date":"2009-04-28T17:14:28Z","paid_date":"2010-01-16T10:46:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":108820,"name":"Lucila Konturnina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Lucila  es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cAswancaris II\u201d en la  provincia de Azangaro, departamento de Puno, tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad, es conviviente con 03 hijos a su cargo, vive en el Jr. Leoncio Prado  N\u00ba 465 Barrio Vilca Apaza.\n\nTrabaja con el Movimiento Manuela R. casi 03 a\u00f1os, la actividad a la que se dedica es la compra y venta de abarrotes, su primer pr\u00e9stamo fue de S\/ 500.00 nuevos soles.\n\nActualmente ella desea un pr\u00e9stamo de S\/ 2500.00 nuevos soles, el mismo que pagara en 06 cuotas;

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\nIn the photo, Marivic is shown supervising one of her workers operating a power-saw. \n\nAbout PMPC:\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She lives in  Brgy. Malis, Brooke's Point, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her two businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 12,000. Julieta is borrowing PHP 29,500 in order to purchase more stock for her general store. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Julieta hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She was born into a simple family of a farmer and had helped her parents with the household since childhood.  It just so happened that Kulnar got married early, at the age of 15.  She finished school in her native village, but could not continue her education because she gave birth to her oldest son.  During the next ten years, Kulnar became a mother to three more children.  In search of a source of income for her family, Kulnar got a job as a butcher (worker who butchers livestock) at the Kaindinskiy meat processing plant in 1980.  This work was very hard, but Kulnar is a strong woman and worked at the plant until she retired in 2008.  Kulnar's husband worked as a shepherd at the collective farm, named after Panfilov, but got involved in taking livestock to a pasture for local residents when the collective farm feel apart after the breakup of the Soviet Union.  Kulnar and her husband used their jointly earned money to create a farm business and provided education for their children with earnings from selling livestock.  At the present time, their oldest son lives with them, and Kulnar takes care of two grandchildren.  Thanks to her persistence and love of hard work, Kulnar's business currently has one dairy cow and one horse.  In order to further develop her business, she requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase thoroughbred horses.  She plans to sell the offsprings.  Kulnar plans to invest the earning from the business into continued breeding of thoroughbred horses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":964985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

P., 45, supports herself by weaving huipiles, the traditional blouse worn by Mayan women. She will use the proceeds of this credit to buy more material. It can take a full month of full time work to make one huipil, and the material normally costs about 75 quetzals, or US$10, but she can sell the finished huipil for about 500 quetzales, or US$65.  She sells her work in the street, and also sells to tourists in a nearby town. She also sells small bags of a nut called \u201caba\u201d for 1 quetzal each (about US$0.08)  and helps in her sister\u2019s  tortilla business. Catarina is separated from her husband, who drank and beat her. She has a total of 7 children ranging in age from 7 to 25. The four younger children live with her. While she is building her own home, they are all  living with a  friend. The house is almost complete, but needs windows and a few other finish items before they move in. \r\nIt has been a long struggle for Catarina but she is persistent. She never had any schooling and speaks only the Cakchiquel language.  Her long-term dream is to be able to open a fruit stand and sell bananas, papaya, apples, pineapples, oranges, and other local fruits. Before receiving micro credits Catarina  had no way to support herself, but now she is on her sixth loan in three years, and she has successfully paid off all previous loans. She says that before receiving the credits she had absolutely no cash and no way to support her family, but as her business has developed she\u2019s very proud of her ability to take care of her children. Perhaps as she is able to continue her success the sadness she feels concerning her family situation and estranged husband will diminish over time."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":50158,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"She will use the proceeds of this credit to buy more material","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santa Catarina Polopo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2007-07-23T04:05:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catarina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-08-06T14:49:17Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":33.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-09-06T09:32:09Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51307},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T19:32:47Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63977},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-11-06T23:08:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":77475},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-12-07T00:40:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":92637},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-01-06T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110458},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-02-06T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129680},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-03-06T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151256},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-04-06T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":175247},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-05-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202510},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-06-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":229749},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2008-07-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":258836},{"amount":26,"local_amount":26,"processed_date":"2008-08-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-06T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287580}],"funded_date":"2007-07-23T14:49:17Z","paid_date":"2008-08-06T09:11:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":18700,"name":"Senia Ruth","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Senia is the young mother of a 7 year-old girl.

Besides his children, Benjamin also supports two nephews from a deceased brother. \r\n<p>\r\nBenjamin studied until 3rd grade and stopped due to his family\u2019s difficult financial situation. At the age of 15 years he started fishing with his father, but soon stopped to join the obligatory military service. In 1988 Benjamin was involved in an ambush and lost both legs. Benjamin decided to move to Maputo rather than returning to Matutuine due to the civil war that was intense in the countryside. Benjamin started to repair shoes and only in 1998 started to receive a pension from the government.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2004 Benjamin decided to go back to Bela Vista in Matutuine with plans to work in an agricultural field, but the lack of rain didn\u2019t allow him to proceed with his plans. He then went back to repairing shoes and also started to sell used clothes, blankets and duvets in a small stand. Benjamin\u2019s wife goes to South Africa to sell pans and buys the blankets and duvets that are then sold in Mozambique. During wintertime the sale of blankets and duvets intensifies. Benjamin\u2019s wife buys them for MTn 350 and he sells them for MTn 800 each.\r\n<p>\r\nBenjamim is an old client of Hluvuku.

With this new loan, the women buy each week:  one sack of big millet (sorghum), some leavening, firewood, and other supplies for making the local beer.  The women help one another in this work, which demands a sizable quantity of firewood, water, and a lot of attention, so as to produce a quality beverage.  \r\n<p>\r\nThey each earn 10,000 francs CFA in selling the beverage each week.  The biggest sales are made on market days, during which villagers from surrounding areas abound.

What she likes most about her work is that, since her business operates in her house, she is able to split her time between the bookstore and her household duties.  She has had this bookstore for 2 years and believes that the most difficult thing is having to spend many hours in it since it is open from very early and closes late.  For the future, she hopes to increase her business and have better income.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Vilma\u2019s second loan with MFP, and she hopes to be able to pay all her payments on time, for she doesn\u2019t want to harm the members of her community bank, where she is highly appreciated because of the happiness that she gives her colleagues.

He is married to Lydia, 48. They have three children: one is in college, the eldest is working and the other stays home.\r\n\r\nPampilo owns and manages a home-based manufacturing business. He makes snack items like banana chips, sweetened puffed corn and fish crackers. He hires an assistant in the work yard.  He earns close to 30,000 Philippine pesos a month. He is happy that one of his children has already finished college and another one is working his way towards graduation. He was also able to purchase property in the province. All these are fruits of his labor.    \r\n\r\nPampilo became an active member of the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2005 and has since been enjoying many benefits from the cooperative. He is currently in need of additional capital for the continuity of his business. He applied for a P30,000 loan with CCT to augment his business needs.\r\n\r\nHe wishes for his small manufacturing station to become a factory soon.  He\u2019s working double time nowadays because he still has two children to get through college.\r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice. This is carried out through the fusion of social-development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, vinegar, soy sauce, sugar & toothpaste in the local community. Benita has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Benita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Benita is requesting a new loan of 3000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Benita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
