At the bottom of the photo, you can see Ms. Rosalina\u2019s flower and costume jewelry shop. For the past 6 years, she has been selling anthuriums, costume jewelry, stationery, and gifts.  She is requesting the loan to invest in her business and plans to add some groceries to her inventory in order to offer more variety.  Her customers regard her as a very hard-worker.  The business is located in the front part of her home.  \r\n\r\nWhen applying for this loan, she felt very happy because she knew she would be able to make her business grow a bit.  She is 64 years old, studied up to the 6th year of primary school, lives in a common-law relationship and has 3 children (one daughter and two sons).  She wants this loan to invest in more merchandise and buy groceries so that her shop will be better stocked.  In addition, she hopes to increase her income in order to be able to expand her house and build a more weather resistant roof as the laminate roof she has at present has fallen on numerous occasions during the suradas (strong South winds).  .  \r\n\r\nAna Laura L. is president of the group.  She is 29 years old, studied up to the 3rd year of secondary school, is married and has 2 sons.  She has been selling stationery for the past 7 years.  She is requesting this loan to buy stationery in order to maintain sales.\r\n\r\nThe group is made up of the following 11 members:\r\nAnselma H. (footwear sales) \r\nEufrosina S.

She is so keen and close with her cows, she has named them, which makes Lispar very proud, and she feels fulfilled. Dairy farming being a very profitable business venture, Lispar wants to take full advantage. She would like to expand her dairy business, but the biggest challenge she faces is feeding her cows. <br \/><br \/>She is respectfully asking for a loan to buy a chaff cutter. A chaff cutter is a mechanical device that is used for cutting hay into smaller pieces before being mixed with other forages for easy digestion by the cow. The loan will assist the cow in producing more milk because they will have plenty of food to feed on. The profits from milk sales will allow Lispar to grow her business further, by starting to package milk and by processing it into other dairy products. In addition, she will benefit from the organic manure from the cow. She projects that she will be able to start a bio-gas plant at her farm, which will save her money in fuel costs. With your loan, all that Lispar dreams of is a secure future for her family. Lispar awaits your kindness."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1983407,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a chaff cutter.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chuka","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.333333 37.65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lispar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4246.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4370.47},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4498.2},{"due_date":"2016-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4629.66},{"due_date":"2016-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":4764.96},{"due_date":"2016-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":4904.22},{"due_date":"2016-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5047.54},{"due_date":"2016-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5195.06},{"due_date":"2016-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5346.88},{"due_date":"2016-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5503.17},{"due_date":"2016-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5663.97},{"due_date":"2016-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":5829.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.37},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.37},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.79},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.24},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.74},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane Rieger","image":235691}},{"id":991881,"name":"Christella","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christella is working as telemarketer.

She is 46 years old and married to Marino, also 46 years old, and her business partner. She lives in the island village of Malacaban, Binangonan, Rizal Province.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1995, Remegia joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and Kiva partner in the Philippines, with a bagful of hope to step out of poverty.  She has maintained a very good performance during her entire membership. Now on her sixth loan, she wishes to borrow 27,000 pesos as additional capital for her fish cage business. She has been in this business for 15 years and acknowledges the proceeds the business had brought to them. This loan will be used to pay for the construction of two fish cages including materials, bamboo, fingerlings, fishnets and payment for human labor costs. Some money will be used for bamboo crafts as a secondary business.\r\n<p>\r\nRemegia is hopeful that with this loan she will be able to expand and have additional fish cages that will give her more fish to be sold in the market during harvest seasons. She also dreams of sending her children to school up to college and on to finding jobs. She wants to have a more spacious and durable house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":351503,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

He runs a small convenience store where he sells various convenience-food products, including soft drinks, bread, candies, etc. As his convenience store is in a good location with a very limited number of stores around, his daily sales volume is quite good. From the start early this year, his business has been doing well. The business capital has increased from 800,000 MNT to 1,000,000 MNT ($1 USD = 1,450 MNT).

He has been buying and selling caps and hats for ten years.  His home is in Paraje Choescuela, Juchanep Canton, Department of Totonicap\u00e1n in Guatemala.  The demand from his customers is currently growing, but his financial condition is not sufficient and he is in need of additional capital.  For this reason, he has come to Asociaci\u00f3n ASDIR to request a loan with the intention of buying more merchandise to increase his sales.  He also hopes to succeed for his family and provide them better living conditions.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Virginia has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 4,500 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Virginia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Virginia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI, a Kiva partner. \r\n\r\nVirginia is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by Virginia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\n<b>About HSPFI:<\/b>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":546904,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She has lived with Cancio (47 years old) for 20 years, and they have 6 children.  They live with 5 of them in their own home located in Huaricolca.  Her goal is for her children to have a profession and be well set up for life.  For this reason she has been enthusiastic in her work, planting potatoes, peas, and oats.  Because of the way she constantly cares for her crops, this generates solid earnings.  Because there is a water shortage at times, she cannot plant, and she turns to selling the milk produced by her two \"mantona\" cows, thereby assuring her family\u2019s financial wellbeing.  Good mother that she is, she always sees that her children are properly fed.

She works there selling a variety of goods, a business that came out of her efforts to become economically independent and generate income so she can contribute to the development and well being of her household. She began this business 5 years ago, selling a few products on credit to her neighbors and friends, and today she has a large cliental and has added much more.  That is to say, everything that her customers want, Derlis gets for them at a good price and they pay her at agreed deadlines. 80% of her sales are for credit, and 20% are cash sales. She also sells for cash at auctions and receives merchandise from Guajira in the north of Colombia. In this way, she sells clothes, perfumes, costume jewelry, and shoes. She is a good businesswoman and so she gets new clients daily, but her working capital isn't enough to meet their orders immediately. This is the reason she has come to Kiva, and this is the first loan she has requested from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. She will use it to buy clothes and especially shoes, an investment that she expects to be successful because it is based on the requests of her clients.

Sia started selling with 500 Liberian dollars (about $8 USD at today's exchange rate) as working capital, and her business at the time was selling peanuts.\r\n\r\nShe faces challenges in transporting goods to market and faces stiff competition from competitors.  She plans to use her 14,000 Liberian dollar portion of this 62,000 Liberian dollar group loan to purchase additional building materials for her business. Her goal is to grow, be prosperous and get a good standard of living. \r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Sia is the one holding the sign.\r\n\r\nAbout LEAP:\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution with 13 branches across the country.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is located in Barrio San Pedro, Actopan in the state of Puebla, Mexico. The group is composed of 7 members that know each other and work in pottery creating articles of clay such as cooking pots, jars, flower pots, and decorative clay figures.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group are going to use the loan in the following ways. Guadalupe Calixta M. C. is going to buy pots and flower pots to supply her business. Se\u00f1ora Silvina Lilia C. Guzm\u00e1n is going to buy pots and figures in bulk go supply her business. Se\u00f1orita Ver\u00f3nica Arag\u00f3n C. is going to buy casserole dishes, pots, and figures in bulk to supply her business. Se\u00f1ora Aurora G\u00f3mez Dom\u00ednguez is going to buy clay, glaze, and firewood to make various articles. Se\u00f1ora Escol\u00e1stica M. M. is going to buy clay, firewood, glaze, and celite (a type of clay), and paint to make her items. Se\u00f1ora Leonor C. Mar\u00edn is going to buy clay, firewood, glaze, celite, paint, and white earth to make her pots \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Guadalupe Calixta M. C. is the representative of the group. She is 41 years old and has 4 daughters who study and work in pottery with their mother. They are Rosalia, 23, who studies at the university of Puebla; Claudia, 15, who studies in high school; Reyna, 12, who is in secondary school; and Elizabeth, 10, who is in primary school. All of her daughters help her work, creating the clay products. Se\u00f1ora Guadalupe Calixta studied in secondary school and got her certificate.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and she is seeking it to invest in crafts and pottery and plans to buy jars and flower pots to supply her business. She also plans to buy clay and firewood to create casseroles, pots, and jars. She began her business ten years ago. Her parents taught her to work the clay when she was a girl. She noticed that her mother worked and thought 'why not me?' Now she works from necessity for the support of her family, to continue investing, for the studies of her daughters, and the household expenses. The products she offers her clients are casseroles, pots, jars, flower pots, pedestals, large jars, clay figures, and all type of clay products. The clients that come to buy the crafts are from various parts of the country - the State of Mexico, Puebla, Tampico, Veracruz, and Morelos. For her the business is important because it insures the well being of her family. The favorite part of the work in pottery is when she sells and recieves the money. It gives her great satisfaction when she takes the products out of the oven and the very lovely casseroles and pots are quite brilliant. Her earnings are used to continue investing and for the houshold expenses, and the studies of her daughters. Her hopes are to have health to continue working and that the business continues to prosper, and that, god willing, her daughters graduate and achieve their careers.\r\n\r\nThe members of the group wish to say to Kiva and to the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \"Reduce the interest rate so you can continue loaning to us and have confidence in us because if we make the payments and if you lower the rate of interest we promise you to get together more clients.\" In the pottery business we face the problem of the weather which may cause the firewood to get wet and the kiln to cause a batch to fail as the glaze falls and the pots come out green and they have to repeat the process, putting on more glaze so they come out shining.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Daniel Burke, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2300,"image":{"id":586311,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buy pots and flower pots to supply the business.

They have three children who are between 20 and 24 years old. Helen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Helen has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 13,500 to purchase more stock for her sari-sari store so that she can continue to save up for her children\u2019s education and for better living conditions. Helen is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

These products are widely consumed by families in Manab\u00ed.  Margoin and her husband work separately.  While he is out making deliveries by car, she sells products at home to customers who come to her shop on a daily basis.  There she also sells barrels of water along with her other products.  Margoin works every day from 7am to 6pm.  She buys her merchandise in Portoviejo from wholesale merchants.

End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.

Since her youth, she has had to help her parents by working because her family had few financial resources.  Reyna has two children who are in school.  Her business involves selling tortillas, curds, and pork.  On the weekends, she prepares soup in order to earn extra income.  When she first started, Reyna was a traveling merchant through the capital of Managua.  She attracted many customers who now buy her flavorful tortillas.  \r\n<p>\r\nBeing a single mother is not easy for Reyna, but with great effort she has been able to support her two children.  She wants them to study so that they can have better working opportunities in life.  Her house is made of blocks and boards, but it lacks plaster on the walls and tiles on the floor because at the moment there is only dirt.  Reyna will build the kitchen and make other improvements gradually using the loans from AFODENIC.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

C. is 46 years old and lives in Amanbaevo village in the north-west of Kyrgyzstan. She has three children \u2013 two sons, one of whom is a student, and a school-aged daughter. Kulsada has a higher pedagogical education, and during the last 20 years she has been working as a teacher of Kyrgyz language and literature in a local school. She is known as a purposeful, positive and sociable person. She likes to work with children and help them to be educated people, which is crucial in the formation of their personalities. Kulsada\u2019s husband is engaged in farming.\nUnfortunately, a teacher's salary in rural areas is very low. That is why in 1995, Kulsada began to engage in stock-breeding using the 10,000 Kyrgyz Soms that she had put aside for a rainy day. At that time, she had only two calves. Gaining experience in cattle breeding, Kulsada broadened her business and today owns three milk cows, three horses and 27 sheep. She also began to cultivate a plot of land. \nKulsada is a really hardworking woman. Her striving to provide her children with a better life motivated her to apply for a loan of 50,000 Kyrgyz Soms for cattle breeding last year. Using the revenues from this loan, Kulsada was able to buy a car for the family. Now, she has decided to apply for a second loan of 80,000 Kyrgyz Soms. She will use it to buy 28 sheep.\nIn the future, Kulsada plans to build a house for her older son and to pay for a good education for the younger one. \n\nKiva's field partner Bai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population. Kiva borrowers benefit from a five per cent discount on the interest rate if they pay back without delay.\n\nAbout Bai-Tushum and Partners\nBai-Tushum and Partners is one of the leading microfinance institutions in Kyrgyzstan. As a reliable financial partner, Bai-Tushum contributes to the economic development of the Kyrgyz Republic through the delivery of microfinance services in rural and urban areas. This leads to increased employment and meets the interests of both clients and investors.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":572003,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Amanbaevo village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2010-07-26T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kulsada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":20000},{"due_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":10000},{"due_date":"2012-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":431.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":646.88},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":215.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":431.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":431.25,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:22:56Z","rounded_local_amount":20266.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195796704},{"amount":646.88,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:23:50Z","rounded_local_amount":30399.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244514500},{"amount":215.62,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":10133.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276816047},{"amount":431.25,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":20266.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294285332}],"funded_date":"2010-07-27T03:24:41Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T08:57:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":220744,"name":"Martha","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Martha naci\u00f3 en la ciudad de Sicuani de la provincia de Canchis del departamento del Cusco.

is an energic young man. He works hard. Apriandi is still single so he does not have any additional burden yet. Since he lives in a rented room, and did not cook himself, his daily living expense is Rp35,000 (about $3.80). So far Apriandi sells Kebaya (local fashion) shirts in the New Market, Kebo Iwa street in Denpasar, Bali. His motor cycle is essential to run his business, distributing his sales goods. With a capital of $10,000,000.00 (about US$1100), he could profit about Rp50,000-100,000 ($5.50-$11)\/night.  Capital from DINARI will be used to increase the number of his sales items. Apriandi also got an opportunity to open a place in a new location, Darmasaba market. Distance between Darmasaba market and Kebo Iwa New Market is 10km (about 6.5 miles). He sells in Darmasaba market in the morning, and at night at Kebo Iwa new market. He started work at 6:00 AM till 6:00 PM. The rest of time he used to find items for sales, and opportunities at other promising markets. His hope by adding new sales area is to increase daily profit to Rp100,000.00-Rp200,000.00 (about $11-$22).\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nApriandi anak muda yang enerjik. Dia sangat rajin bekerja. Apriandi belum berkeluarga, jadi dia masih belum memiliki tanggungan. Karena dia tinggal di kos \u2013 kosan dan tidak masak makanannya sendiri, biaya hidup per harinya mencapai Rp 35.000,00. Apriandi selama ini berjualan baju kebaya di pasar baru Jl. Kebo Iwa, Denpasar, Bali. Sepeda motor miliknya adalah sarana yang sangat dia butuhkan untuk kelangsungan usahanya ini dalam mendistribusikan barang \u2013 barang dagangannya. Dengan modal Rp 10.000.000,00 keuntungan yang  diperoleh mencapai Rp 50.000,00 \u2013 Rp 100.000,00\/malam. Modal dari DINARI digunakan untuk menambah jumlah barang \u2013 barang dagangan. Sekarang Apriandi mendapat peluang usaha yang sama di tempat yang baru, yaitu  di pasar Darmasaba. Jarak antara Pasar Darmasaba dengan Pasar Baru Kebo Iwa adalah 10 km. Dia berjualan pada pagi hari di pasar Darmasaba  dan berjualan pada malam harinya di Pasar Baru Kebo Iwa. Waktunya di pasar mulai dari pukul 6 pagi sampai dengan 6 sore. Waktu sisanya digunakan untuk  mencari barang \u2013 barang dagangan yang dia jual dan juga mencari kemungkinan pasar lain yang peluangnya menjanjikan baginya. Harapannya - dengan menambah tempat usaha berdagang - dia  memperoleh keuntungan per hari \u00b1 Rp 100.000,00 \u2013 Rp 200.000,00."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":68634,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To add number of sales items <p>Menambah jumlah barang \u2013 barang dagangan","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Badung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.5 115.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-09-24T23:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Apriandi","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-10T06:08:06Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2007-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2007-10-17T06:05:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:34:42Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":68305},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2007-11-23T03:40:42Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":85244},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2007-12-31T08:48:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:35:38Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":105290},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-01-30T03:01:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:36:39Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124108},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-03-01T07:39:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145965},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-04-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:39:01Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":178727},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-05-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206276},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-06-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:41:48Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":234114},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-07-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:47Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":262884},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-08-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:40Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":291766},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-09-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-21T07:16:58Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322210},{"amount":44,"local_amount":44,"processed_date":"2008-10-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-29T07:09:01Z","rounded_local_amount":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":354549}],"funded_date":"2007-09-26T06:08:06Z","paid_date":"2008-10-29T07:09:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":23249,"name":"Martha Lorena","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Mrs. Martha B. is originally from Bluefields.

In the field, she now faces a small problem because infertile soil has affected her crop. She decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizers to support the field. She hopes she can produce productive cucumbers for sale. Her husband, Mr. Eang Auk, helps her with the vegetable planting. Mrs. Koeurn S. has two children, one of whom is a laborer while the other is attending the local school. \r\n\r\nEight members in this village bank loan are end-of-term borrowers and the rest have monthly-payment loans. The end-of-term borrowers are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because they are the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. EoT loans allow them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva.

Digna works selling french fries, fried yucca and bananas, and meat pies.  The meat pies are made from a corn base and are filled with vegetables and then fried.  It is a typical dish of El Salvador, which is usually eaten in the afternoons.  Her business is located in the vicinity of the Catholic Church in the area.  This brings her many benefits, as it is a busy area where people go shopping each afternoon to buy a typical dish to enjoy with their families.  Digna is requesting a loan so she can have the necessary money to purchase potatoes, oil, green beans, and carrots, as these are the main ingredients for her sales.  Digna have a very large family, so she must work very hard together with her husband.

Ahmad specializes in croissants: flaky crescent-shaped bread roll made of a yeast dough similar to puff pastry, which can be either plain or sweet, such as a chocolate croissant. In Lebanon people also eat savoury croissants with zaatar (thyme) and jebneh (cheese). One can eat these croissant varieties anytime of the day, but somehow they taste better in the morning. The best time to eat a croissant is when it just went out of the oven when it is still hot, then it simply tastes great. Ahmad is a croissant specialist because he is known for his good and tasty croissants. He started his business a year ago when he realized that there is great demand for a baker in his region, especially since there is a school next to his bakery. Because he is well located, he has a broad customer base including friends, neighbors, passer bys and school children. Ahmad requested a loan from Al Majmoua in order to purchase an oven and also a motorcycle for his bakery. The motorcycle will allow him to do home deliveries and increase his customers base. This is the first time that Ahmad has requested a loan from Al Majmoua. Ahmad decided on this business because he always wanted to open a bakery on his own, after working in the same field and gaining some experience. In the future, he plans on expanding his

She started her businesses since joining ASHI in 1995, as an additional source of income but they already are bringing in profit as a main source. Nenita`s weekly profit is 3,000 Php and she is going to increase it. For this reason she applied for a loan in the amount of 45,000 PHP. She says that selling dried fish and fresh fish in an open-air stall is not easy as it is very hot, therefore Nenita wishes to save enough money to construct her own booth.\r\n\r\nAs a loving mother, Nenita\u2019s biggest dreams are always for her children and family. She wants to bring her family to a decent life. In 1995, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and a Kiva partner in the Philippines. She hoped to have access to capital to establish her businesses. Her previous loans from ASHI were carefully utilized as additional and rolling working capital for her fish cage and for selling dried fish products. The businesses are a big help for the family in covering their expenses and to set aside savings for the future.\r\n\r\nTo save for her family\u2019s future and for supplementary income, Nenita wants to build new businesses: RTW (ready-to-wear clothes) and food preparation. Nenita wants to thank Kiva lenders who are sponsoring this loan. That is one of the greatest opportunities for her to start reaching for her dreams.

She visits different jewelry shops in Borewala city to get orders and supplies in the given time to make an income. Her husband and son make handmade curtains (which is used for windows and doors to avoid the sun\u2019s heat). It provides them with a reasonable income. Their business grows especially in the summer season, and they now face the problem of insufficient stock.\r\n  \r\nSo, Rafiqan has applied for a loan for the second time from Asasah to support her husband\u2019s business.

She lives in a four-room brick house with her family in the area called Yadgar. She moved here after her marriage with S. M. two years ago. She is 31 years old, a very enthusiastic lady who has an infant child, a baby girl named Rosemary. As a housewife she is doing a great job and is playing her part as a mother and a wife very well.\r\n\r\nHer husband is a blacksmith. He runs a shop in the market where he makes iron rods and iron-made items such as doors and windows for his customers. He has been doing this work since his youth. He learned this art from his father who was a famous blacksmith of his time.  \r\n\r\nNazia has applied for a loan from Asasah for her husband.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  pig fattening and dressmaking. Her 52-year-old husband, Feliciano, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have five children who are between 11 and 29 years old. \r\n\r\nTessie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Tessie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,200, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to buy feeds, medicines and vaccines for the pigs. She wants to continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nTessie is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF: <\/b>In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

Even as she makes her microbusiness grow, it is in her heart to extend the blessings to others. Feliza graduated from high school and now heads a family with Carlito, a mechanic. Feliza and Carlito raise eight children: one is in college, three are in high school, two study in elementary school and the other two stay home.\r\n<br>A vulcanizing shop is Feliza's business. She manages this hand in hand with Carlito, with no need yet for hiring employees. Everyday, they cater to clients in the vicinity with vehicles that need repairing. Feliza has been in this business for ten years and earns 10,600 PHP per month. She believes that her shop is going well but that it can be improved a lot more.\r\n<br>To capitalize on this opportunity to improve and level up, Feliza is seeking financial help by means of a 10,000 PHP loan. She intends to use this primarily to buy a machine needed for her vulcanizing shop. This added facility will definitely improve performance and, consequently, profits. The loan is a beacon of hope for her towards a growth in profits, and it serves as an encouragement to her to save more with the help of CCT. Feliza says that with the loan, she is more enabled to help others.\r\n<br>Feliza struggles with sickness at present, which hinders her from performing at her best and maximizing the opportunity to help others. Still, she believes in the Lord to strengthen her and bless her business as she remains faithful to her work with discipline and integrity. Feliza desires to lead a successful and peaceful life.

He lives with his parents. His father works at a factory and gets minimum salary, his mother is a housewife. The money they both earn is not enough to meet their needs. Valyeryi willingly contributes to the expenses of his family. His primary goal has always been to give his family a better standard of living. After Valyeryi got back from the military, he worked in a firm selling flower seeds and fertilizers. The experience he gained in this work gave him the confidence he needed to start his own small business and master his commercial activities efficiently.\r\n\r\nValyeryi is very hard-working and enterprising. He works in his greenhouses day and night. He always says his work is something that gives him enthusiasm and inspiration, for it brings beauty into the world. In summer, Valyeryi sets up stalls in the open markets of the city selling the flowers and plants he has grown. Usually it provides a seasonal job and a decent salary for one or two free lancers. Valyeryi has succeeded in managing his previous loans in \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d and repaid all of them without any delinquencies. \r\n\r\nValyeryi is eager to access the above amount to buy more flower seeds and bulbs. He is planning to expand the surface he cultivates for greater production. Valyeryi is going to grow potted and cultivated flowers in the greenhouses and sell them in summer. This loan will help him get a wider variety of flowers and a larger quantity of plants. Moreover, the loan will give Valyeryi a chance to improve his greenhouses to protect them against ups and downs of the climate, particularly drops in temperature. Valyeryi will benefit from more consistent financial support because it will strengthen his trade and provide the important profit margin he needs to improve his business.    \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n

The loan will be repaid over 12 months. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":231056,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of car parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Gissar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.524722 68.551389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Shavkat","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:26:40Z","rounded_local_amount":765.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20428660},{"amount":75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:05:50Z","rounded_local_amount":255.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27122437},{"amount":75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:21:59Z","rounded_local_amount":255.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36017799},{"amount":75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:26:54Z","rounded_local_amount":255.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44601843},{"amount":75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:08:53Z","rounded_local_amount":255.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52996415},{"amount":75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T17:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":255.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63217638},{"amount":75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T20:05:39Z","rounded_local_amount":255.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73646955},{"amount":75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-24T10:24:45Z","rounded_local_amount":255.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87086383},{"amount":75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-24T09:16:33Z","rounded_local_amount":255.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97002154},{"amount":75,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-24T09:34:31Z","rounded_local_amount":255.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103847022}],"funded_date":"2009-02-11T11:19:14Z","paid_date":"2009-12-24T09:34:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Hazen","image":1498099}},{"id":80632,"name":"Benjamin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Benjamin B. is fifty years old.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has a store in Sikasso's grand market. In order to satisfy the demands of her growing clientele, she joined the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso four years ago. \r\nAfter 6 group loans with a women's association from her neighborhood (Association Benkadi de Sanoubougou II,) she is now on her second individual loan. Her previous loans were all repaid according to the terms.  With this new loan, she plans to purchase 6 bags of rice, 8 bags of corn, 5 bags of sorghum, 2 bags of peanuts and 4 sacks of millet.  She buys the rice in Niono (in the S\u00e9gou region) and the other grains from the area surrounding Sikasso.  She retails the grain for cash. Her clients are mostly heads of households. \r\nShe expects to realize a monthly benefit of 250 000 FCFA from this loan, which she will use to support the family's expenses, make loan payments, and invest in her business. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Linda Koza, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":381344,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of bulk grains.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-09-04T16:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ass\u00e9tou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":58333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":129.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:56:51Z","rounded_local_amount":59111.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112768},{"amount":129.16,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":59111.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028338},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:44Z","rounded_local_amount":59111.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873665},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":59111.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763376},{"amount":129.16,"local_amount":58333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:13Z","rounded_local_amount":59111.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152198},{"amount":129.17,"local_amount":58333.35,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:38Z","rounded_local_amount":59111.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991086}],"funded_date":"2009-09-05T10:46:47Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Koza","image":249316}},{"id":138027,"name":"Emily","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emily is happily married to Ruben.

This will be her eighth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.
