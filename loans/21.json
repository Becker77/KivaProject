In the past, many immigrants from Haiti came to work the sugar fields in Dominican Republic in order to make a living.

Since he was a boy he has grown citrus and other fruit trees, but six years ago he began cutting down trees. He now has an established clientele for whom he provides wood to be made into fruit crates. He begins working at 4:00am, when he goes deep into the forest to look for mature trees. He pays S\/20.00 (approximately US $6.50) for each tree and then sells the cut wood for S\/36.00 (approximately US $11.50). It is a very profitable enterprise, and for most of the year he completely covers his expenses. During the rainy season, however, he cannot remove the trees from the forest.

She is 39 years old and lives in her own house, with her youngest son Franz, 14. She wants to give him a better future and be able to pay for his higher studies. For 4 years Ana has been clothing people that converge at the Tupac Amaru market (an important market of Juliaca city). Her stand is one of the most visited, and she now has a large variety of garments, as many for women as gentlemen. She would like to create a bigger shop, where she could better attend to her clients and show them more clothes. She enjoys selling and talking to her clients at her stand, but what is difficult is carrying the clothes to her stand where she works, which is too tiring for her alone. Ana works very hard, and now needs money to pay for the studies of her dear son, to whom she wants to give a good life. This is the 4th loan that Ana has accessed, and as she did with her previous loans, she desires to pay it back in time and without difficulty. Within her communal bank she is very well respected, and she is now the most active and engaged member. With the loan of 600 soles ($200) she will buy more goods and in this way increase the amount of clothes that she sells. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":272800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buy garments for her shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-18T00:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:35:56Z","rounded_local_amount":107.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117087},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:03Z","rounded_local_amount":107.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012000},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:12Z","rounded_local_amount":107.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595585},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":107.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989847},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:25Z","rounded_local_amount":107.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210983},{"amount":33.35,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":107.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640484}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T00:55:35Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane McCrory","image":240040}},{"id":93428,"name":"Agnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes A. is 48 years old.

O. is a 48-year-old general store owner from Eastern Samar. She immigrated with her family to Maricaban, Pasay City years ago. Her husband, Fernando, 49, is a fellow business entrepreneur. Their three children are all attending school.\r\n<p>\r\nRose has been doing different businesses for the past 15 years.  Along with her general store, Rose has a meat stall in Libertad Public Market. She also cooks breakfast goodies and sells them to her neighbors. She has hired the services of an assistant to help her tend her businesses. Rose is earning 48,000 PHP a month. \r\n<p>\r\nOver the years, Rose\u2019s businesses have grown steadily. Then, a few years ago, she became afflicted with severe hypertension. Medical expenses have taken a heavy toll on their finances. She thanks God that she learned of Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2006.  With the loans she received, her businesses slowly recovered. She has also recovered but has to take medications for the rest of her life.  \r\n<p>\r\nRose is now on her seventh loan cycle with the cooperative. She is in need of a loan of 20,000 PHP. She wants to venture into the business of buying and selling dried fish. Rose is thankful that she is alive and strong. She works hard, hand-in-hand with her husband, to be able to fund their children\u2019s education.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About CCT:<\/b>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response to poverty and social injustice. It is carried out through a fusion of social development initiatives and an evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.

42-year-old married man. Siafa has three children aged 9 to 14 years old and their educational levels are 2nd through 6th grade. He is a high school graduate but could not continue to university due to lack of financial support from his parents. Siafa lives and works in the Dualla community, north of Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. This is a very big commercial community and the majority of its inhabitants live on small and medium-sized businesses.\r\n\r\nSiafa's business is the sale of fresh fish, meat and chicken. He buys his product wholesale from fishermen, poultrymen and butchers and sells to the local residents. He has been running this business for three years and hopes to become a business investor in the future.\r\n\r\nSiafa's difficulty is the rainy season because, during this season, it can be very hard for customers to buy when it is wet. But he also gives his customers a good manner of approach and cleans his business premises in order to encourage them to always patronize his business.\r\n\r\nSiafa needs this loan in order to increase his capital so as to improve his business. He dreams of building a house for himself and his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":402167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Sa r\u00e9putation d\u00e9passe le cadre de S\u00e9gou.\nPour faire de la teinture, elle dilue diff\u00e9rents produits de teintures modernes et traditionnels dans de l\u2019eau chaude ensuite elle trempe les tissus blancs  dans cette eau pour leur donner la couleur voulue.  Les tissus teint\u00e9s sont \u00e9tal\u00e9s sur une corde pour s\u00e9chage. Ensuite elle les am\u00e8ne chez le couturier.

She lives with her husband and children in a traditional family with several households in the first district of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  Soon after dropping out of school in 6th class (education system of Mali), she very soon started earning revenues by opting for an apprenticeship dyeing cloth.  She learned this trade from one of her sisters-in-law 15 years ago.  Today, she enjoys a lot of experience and distinction.  She has an excellent command of the ins and outs of this business sector.  Her reputation extends beyond S\u00e9gou.  \r\n\r\nTo dye cloth, she dilutes different modern and traditional dye products in hot water.  Then she soaks white fabrics in this water to give them the desired color.  The dyed fabrics are spread out on a rope to dry.  Next, she takes them to a tailor.  Once the clothing is sewn, it\u2019s washed and carefully wrapped.  \r\n\r\nWith plans to increase her business capital, to realize bigger profits, she turned toward Soro Yiriwaso.  She is on her first individual loan, which she intends to use to buy 3 bolts of damask cloth.  She supplies herself locally and in Bamako from wholesalers.  And she sells to customers composed of women and men, cash or credit accepted.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she anticipates earning a monthly profit of 40,000 francs CFA.  This will allow her to help her husband and to assist with societal events (baptisms, marriages, etc.)  Her ambition is to open a ready-to-wear clothing store. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

For over a year, he has worked in public transport in a motorcycle taxi that he managed to buy thanks to the money from his savings. Jorge works in his taxi everyday covering routes in Cayalt\u00ed and its surrounding villages. This business is the only source of family income from which he tries to stretch to its limit.

In the house lives her entire family that is comprised of 6 people: Cecilia, her huband and their four children, Cecilia works as a regular employee in a business that is dedicated to providing cleaning services to private enterprises and also to private residences.  Her husband is a master bricklayer.  There is the usual competition in their fields now that there are other people that offer the same services.  But their early beginning permits them to build on their experience, above all with their regular clientele.  The loan will be used as working capital for the husband for the purchase of building materials that he requires in some works that he prepares as finished goods.  This will be her sixth loan cycle with Agrocapital.  She has an excellent record of payment in all her other loans.  The couple are very responsible people and work together to help their family get ahead.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Barbara (B) Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":487849,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buy building materials for her husband's bricklaying business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-02-14T03:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cecilia De","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":66.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:46Z","rounded_local_amount":66.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909443},{"amount":137.54,"local_amount":137.54,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:24Z","rounded_local_amount":137.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945019},{"amount":68.23,"local_amount":68.23,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:44Z","rounded_local_amount":68.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673351},{"amount":67.04,"local_amount":67.04,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":67.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707374},{"amount":60.54,"local_amount":60.54,"processed_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-02T08:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":60.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631279},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-24T07:56:53Z","rounded_local_amount":66.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845277},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-29T10:55:11Z","rounded_local_amount":66.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172111610},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-19T10:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":66.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405047},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:25:41Z","rounded_local_amount":66.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182543563},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-21T09:24:45Z","rounded_local_amount":66.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188680364},{"amount":66.63,"local_amount":66.63,"processed_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-19T10:40:04Z","rounded_local_amount":66.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191421841}],"funded_date":"2010-02-16T22:53:07Z","paid_date":"2011-02-19T10:40:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"B Brown","image":120650}},{"id":180119,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irene D. is from the village of   Malinao ,  Gingoog City.

All of them are from the city of Chill\u00e1n.\r\n\r\nRuth is a member of the communal bank.  In the photo she\u2019s seated in the second spot from right to left wearing a brown jacket and pointing her thumb up.  She has been making costumes for the last three years.  She started out with 20 costumes and now she has 200.  She buys patterns and designs to make them and then rent or sell them.\r\n\r\nDuring the months between August and December she makes costumes because the other months orders tend to decrease so then she works doing clothing repairs and making some individual articles of clothing.  Ruth works at home; she sews and sells there.  She also comments that she has many customers especially teenagers.  She buys her merchandise in the cities of Concepci\u00f3n and Santiago.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy patterns, lace, fabric, ribbon, zippers, decorations, tulle and satin.  Her goals are to have an established locale where she can sell her costumes and party supplies.  Besides, she\u2019d like to buy an overlock sewing machine because she currently only has a straight stitch sewing machine.\r\n\r\nRuth lives with her mother and her four children who are 21, 19, 11 and 8 years old and with a 2-year-old grandson.  Her dreams on a personal level are to study clothing design specializing in wedding gowns.\r\n\r\nHer motivation to stay in business is that Ruth is the only source of family income.  Besides, it\u2019s allowed her flexibility in her schedule to be able to raise her children.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for services rendered by Fondo Esperanza because she\u2019s been able to invest in her business.  She comments that she\u2019s known the other group members for quite some time and they have a very good cooperative relationship among them.\r\n\r\nChill\u00e1n is a commune in south-central Chile.

With her first loan from SPBD she set up a flea market business selling shoes, clothes and perfume.

She only studied through elementary school because her father didn't want to support her education any futher.  She stayed at home helping her mother take care of her brothers and sisters.  She has five children, three of whom depend on her economically.  Margarita has bought and sold animals for 14 years.  She started off by selling vegetables, but she abandoned this business because she didn't earn a lot of profits.  Now she buys and sells cows, pigs, and guinea pigs.  At harvest time she also buys and sells cereal and potatoes.  She has her business at her home.  With her first credit of 300 soles, which she received from the communal bank \"Mujeres Trabajadoras\" (Hard-Working Women), she invested in the purchase of vegetables to sell.  With this credit of 2,500 soles, which will be repaid in 4 months, she will invest in the purchase of a bull.  Margarita dreams about buying a taxi.

With the loan Abdusalim will purchase young cattle and construction materials for improving his cattle-shed.     \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

What she likes best about her communal bank is its education themes and the union between its partners. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lois Parshley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":477845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy lipstick, cream, perfume, etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno, Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-02-14T15:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"France","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":178.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954570},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":178.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987598},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:30Z","rounded_local_amount":178.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713624},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":178.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746671}],"funded_date":"2010-02-15T05:02:17Z","paid_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lois Parshley","image":null}},{"id":180137,"name":"Runyerere Bakyara Tukwatanise Group, Kihihi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"K.

His work as a mason is exhausting, but it pays well.  Today, only two of her children live with her since they are currently in school.  The others live independently.  At one time she worked at a restaurant kitchen when her sewing business did not generate enough income, but the establishment closed down, so she resumed sewing while attending to her household chores and caring for her family.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, Maria will buy various fabrics, buttons, fringe, and zippers for making dresses to complete her orders.

She is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Bernadeth owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. Bernadeth has been engaged in her business for over 8 years now.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Bernadeth joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Bernadeth has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. Bernadeth is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Bernadeth from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children and improve her family's living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

She works daily from 6am to receive the milk that\u2019s delivered to her house.  Later she and her husband distribute it throughout the sector.  As for the chickens, she keeps them for a period of time of two months and then she plucks them and sells them to local stores or by the pound to local residents.\r\n\r\nShe is a founding member of the communal bank and she likes it because the installments are easy to pay as long as one works with responsibility. \r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy chickens to raise and to pay for the milk which is a weekly expense.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a large chicken farm in order to become a wholesaler.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":615666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To pay for the milk and to buy chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-10-14T19:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domitila Filadelfia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:18Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407662},{"amount":137.49,"local_amount":137.49,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:31:31Z","rounded_local_amount":137.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388863},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188683065},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191422189},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195840967},{"amount":91.7,"local_amount":91.7,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:02:05Z","rounded_local_amount":91.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201283426}],"funded_date":"2010-10-15T16:35:15Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:02:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":241793,"name":"Loida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loida V. is from the village of Maribucao, Gingoog City.

She is 57 years old and leads a two-member group loan made up of members of GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this group is Tanglad.\r\n\r\nElma is married, has two school-aged children and earns a living by making and selling food. She has been in this business for more than two years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month from her work.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Elma joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and ability to engage in business. She is applying for a loan, her first, for 5,000 PHP to buy ingredients to make products to make more food items to sell. She plans to use the additional revenue generated by her business to continue expanding it. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":651639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Recently, our client divorced and was left with three daughters to raise.  She has worked for many years in field of medicine and devoted all this time to working in a hospital.  Cholpon had to leave her work since her newborn baby requires constant care.  She spent her savings and salary (10,000 som) to buy three head of livestock.  Cholpon has begun to master a new trade: raising livestock.  After only one year of experience, Cholpon has not had trouble becoming accustomed to her new business.

The group's members sell dried fish, fresh tomatoes, garments, second hand clothes, and gruel. The women joined the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance association with the aim of boosting their business capital, and are now on their third loan. Madam Sagnini Traor\u00e9 has built a reputation in the Zambougou village for selling gruel, and aims to use her loan to purchase four bags of millet wholesale at the Konodimini market. \r\nTo make gruel, she must first husk the seeds, wash them, crush them with a mill until they form semolina which she then heats to make gruel. She differentiates herself from other gruel vendors by adding curdled milk and sugar. She takes cash and credit sales from home or via door-to-door sales around the village. Her customer base is made up of men, women and children. Madam Sagnini Traor\u00e9 aims to use the loan to generate an average monthly profit of 20,000 FCFA which will be used to reinvest in the business and to see to her family's needs.

She has one cow and some poultry which she uses for laying. With the cow, she practices zero-grazing, which means that instead of the cow grazing on grasses throughout the village, it is penned up in a small corral. Feed is then bought and fed to the cow. This method takes much less attention, is simple, and quite yielding in growth. The downside is the time it takes to sickle the grass and bring it to the cow.<p>With her loan, she plans to buy more chicks for laying. It takes several months for chicks to become layers, and money for feed has to be spent prior to getting a return, so this can be difficult since few people have the ability to save.

She requests a personal loan to make repairs to her kitchen and purchase new furniture. The money will be used to install new gas lines to her kitchen, which is crucial during the winter months when electricity is available only during specific hours of the day. With gas lines she is able to use 'balloon' gas - or canisters which can be stored for use when gas is not available from the city supply. Because of last year's winter conditions, much of Bashorat's furniture was damaged.  During periods where there was no heat in the home, the furniture became very cold.  When the heat returned, condensation formed and has warped her wooden table, chairs and other furniture.  She will use a portion of proceeds for the purchase of new furniture.\r\n\r\nBashorat plans to repay the loan over the next 12 months from her salary earned as a notary. She and her husband have a grown daughter who is married and also a son who is currently studying at the University in Khujand.

In this plantation, he faces an obstacle because his field is infertile soil. In order to deal this problem, Mrs. Theavy C. decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer and she would use the rest of money to buy piglet for breeding. She is 34 years old and the mother of five children, four of whom are enrolled in the local school and the youngest one is too young to work or study. \n\nAll the members in this group loan are end-of-term loans so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loans term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make their payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s client make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":392199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To ask for a loan to buy fertilizer and she would use the rest of money to buy piglet for breeding.

To make a living, Rosalinda owns & operates a business raising pigs for sale. Rosalinda has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rosalinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosalinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase piglets to raise & sell in the future. Rosalinda is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Rosalinda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Unfortunately the salary that he was earning was minimal, and was not sufficient to support his family.  For this reason he decided to invest his savings to start up a store in his home where he started selling sweets and other small items.  In spite of the competition, his business is doing well.  He tries to keep it well-stocked so that his customers can always find what they need.  He works in the store and his wife helps him at times when he is absent, because he is also continuing to work independently as a cleaner 3 times a week.  With his income he has been able to buy a display case and a freezer which he needed to improve his business, and he also helps his son pay for his studies.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Se\u00f1or Nolasco wants to look for an appropriate site where he could have a bigger store in a strategic location.  He belongs to the communal bank \"Mujeres Rumo al Progreso,\" and it has helped him a lot with his projects.  He is the only man, and he is happy to be a part of the group. On this occasion he will use his loan to buy food for poultry, venturing into this area because the majority of his neighbors raise poultry, and they get a good price for this product.

Myrna joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Myrna has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 28,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,000 to buy additional products to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and expansion of her business. Myrna is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

There are many designers, who are generators of ideas and low-level seamstresses, who execute the intended idea. However, very often both sides face misunderstandings which are caused by the absence of a middle linkage between them. The industry is in need of mid-level employees who would interpret top designers' ideas into small tasks for seamstresses. \r\n\r\nZoya, 53, is the leader of this group. She is one of those linkage employees who are critically important for any business. Zoya is married and has been providing private sewing and designing services for two years. She acquired these skills while working for a local fashion house. Her business was started with the purchase of a sewing machine for 10,000 soms. This equipment is Zoya's main asset and helps create hundreds of looks. A monthly profit is around 6,000 soms (~$135); however, a very small part of it is saved for the purchase of additional equipment. Zoya would like to use the loan for the purchase of a new type of sewing machine that would definitely improve the quality of her clothing. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\t\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n MBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She lives in her own house together with her partner and her three beloved children, for whom she works very hard to get them ahead.\r\n\r\nLuisa has spent most of her life in her beloved town of Santa Rosa.  From a very young age she learned farming, the family business.  Today she works her own land alongside her beloved partner, who grows cacao and coffee, crops that have provided the income necessary to support his family.  She sells everything she harvests in the distribution centers located in the cities of San Francisco and Santa Rosa, where she receives better prices for all her crops.\r\n\r\nWhat Luisa likes best about her work is planting her land, and she does it with painstaking care.  She has been doing this work for 12 years and she considers that the hardest part is transporting her crops, since cargo vehicles are scarce in this part of the jungle area of the Apurimac River Valley.

She started out helping a woman who ran a tailoring shop, and after she learned the trade she was offered a job. As time went on, the owner passed away, and Blasa always remembered how the owner had encouraged her to start her own business. So that's what she did, installing a small shop in her home.

On the other hand, what he dislikes is having to walk for long hours to reach his farmlands because there is no road.\r\n\r\nHe also learned how to be a baker.  He has baked for the last two months and, upon seeing the good profits he makes from both activities, he is planning to set up a bakery in the future to make bread and cakes.

He started his small business when he was in his late teens and gradually, though much hard work, he has been able to develop it into quite a successful enterprise. Ilhomjon has the qualities it takes to succeed as an entrepreneur. Goal-oriented, hard-working and punctual, he is a natural businessman. \r\n\r\nFunding from IMON International has been instrumental in helping Ilhomjon build his business. His first loan was for $1,500 and since that time, he has benefited from one additional loan while establishing a great credit history. \r\n\r\nHe has requested a loan of $2,000 to add to his available working capital. The ability to purchase large quantities of inventory in bulk saves time and expense for merchants such as Ilhomjon. He appreciates the availability of funding through IMON International. It allows him to take advantage of good opportunities and focus on growing his business so that he is able to adequately provide for himself and his family.  \r\n \r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a being key post along the Silk Road, and for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives in his own home in the rural district of Tucume in the Lambayeque region in the north of Peru. The only home utility he receives is water - he does not have electrical supply. His community is small, with about 50 families living there. \r\nFor 20 years, he has been earning a living raising and selling young animals in corrals located in the back part of his home. He typically raises pigs, sheep, turkeys, and ducks, and when they have reached a good point of development he offers them for sale to the middlemen who always visit the area where he lives.

She went to school and earned her middle school diploma (BEPC).  Lacking the support to continue her education, she had to quit.  She then learned to sew, and for five years she has been running her own dressmaking shop, called \u00abVivre Ensemble\u00bb, or Live Together, thanks to an initial loan of $350, which she repaid without a problem.  She is in a common-law marriage with a plumber who left in search of work in B\u00e9nin.  That is why Mrs. G. has been alone for 16 months with her 3-year-old daughter.  There has been no news of her husband.  She courageously deals with household expenses by herself.  An adroit and very energetic woman, she puts everything she knows into her work, and she is renowned in her neighborhood for the quality of her services.  She would like to include among her goods for sale various fabrics and other boutique items not currently available in her area.  This will provide a comprehensive range of goods for her customer base.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, she is requesting a loan of $950 to stock and sell traditional skirts, bags, and shoes for women.

She came to selling fish by doing volunteer work for fishermen.  Each evening, she used to go and gather the fish that the fishermen had left.  She would smoke them.  Little by little, she developed an interest in selling smoked fish.  And then she invested her small income in a carton of frozen fish.  Once smoked, the fish were offered in front of her home.  Today, she is a great merchant, renowned by local consumers.  And so, the demand has gotten very good, but she lacks enough money to grown her business.  She is therefore requesting a loan of $1,000 to increase her production and to meet customer expectations.  That is how she will succeed in improving her family's living conditions.  \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva volunteer:<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMadame A.

She and her husband help each other in running their business. The couple lives in the village of Nabantu-an, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. Even while she is growing older, Milagros and her husband want to retain their independence by having their own business. Milagros is quite content that her 3 children have their own families and are all gainfully employed, earning enough to afford giving extra money to support their parents. Milagros is very aware that she needs to have proper nutrition now to stay healthy, and she also dreams to build a decent house for herself and her husband.\r\n\r\nMilagros always wanted to help her husband earn their living. She knew that if she only had the opportunity to use her cooking skills, she'd make a successful business, but before she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001, she did not have such an opportunity. But as soon as she became a member of NWTF-PD, she was able to set up her own \"carinderia\" an eatery or luncheonette selling and serving cooked food in a simple kitchen setup, adjacent to her house. Before long she had a loyal clientele and her food sold out fast each day, she had to frequently increase the volume she cooked each day. It was fortunate that she could borrow additional capital to address the growing opportunity that she was able to sustain and stabilize her business. Later, she even started investing in raising pigs as it would allow her to build savings. She only sold her pigs when she really needed the money. Her business ventures earn her an average income of PHP 5,000 per month and it is taking her one step nearer her dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith her previous loan, she borrowed Php 10,000 on her 12th cycle and used it as additional capital for her businesses. She was able to return this loan in full without any delays. Now she is borrowing the same amount of Php 10,000 for her 13th cycle loan to use in her business in Carinderia and raising pigs.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":401986,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

to support their three children. Despite the current economic crisis, they have a strong faith and determination to be successful in the future through patience and hard work. \r\n<p>\r\nWithin their village, Maricel and Arsenio cultivate their small parcel of land by planting rice and some vegetables.

She lives at home with her parents and her greatest hope is to succeed in life.  \r\n<p>\r\nLizeth spends her days weaving wool caps, scarves, gloves, etc.  She sells her finished articles from a small vending post located in La Rinconada (a mining town) where she has been able to quickly build up her clientele.  Weaving is the part of her job that she enjoys most.  She learned this skill when she was very young and now has been in business for three years.

His customers and neighbors admire him very much, and consider him to be an honest man.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shaun Haines, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":540314,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of materials and tools to grow his business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chep\u00e9n, La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-05-17T02:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eduardo Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":69.96},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":71.21},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":74.52},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":74.37},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":80.09},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":83.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":87.74},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":89.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":92.65},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":96.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":98.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.7},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.89},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.04},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.71},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.26},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.9},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.14},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":26.24,"local_amount":69.96,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":74.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695203},{"amount":26.7,"local_amount":71.21,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:38Z","rounded_local_amount":75.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878248},{"amount":27.94,"local_amount":74.52,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:51:02Z","rounded_local_amount":79.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618276},{"amount":27.89,"local_amount":74.37,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":79.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832675},{"amount":30.04,"local_amount":80.09,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":85.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099282},{"amount":30.71,"local_amount":81.9,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":87.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554693},{"amount":31.26,"local_amount":83.36,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:54:13Z","rounded_local_amount":88.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188666252},{"amount":66.52,"local_amount":177.4,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:54:41Z","rounded_local_amount":188.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191409586},{"amount":34.74,"local_amount":92.65,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:49:04Z","rounded_local_amount":98.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201270168},{"amount":72.96,"local_amount":194.54,"processed_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:46:47Z","rounded_local_amount":206.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206137000}],"funded_date":"2010-05-23T01:57:49Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:46:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shaun Haines","image":55908}},{"id":204962,"name":"Phineas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Phineas is 40 years old.

To make a living, Angeliza owns & operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community.

Angeliza has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Angeliza is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Angeliza from ASKI.

the life conditions became completely unbearable, Salima went to sell on a market. This was 6 years ago. For the last several years, Salima\u2019s husband has been away working as a seasonal laborer in Russia. He earns very little. The irregular money transfers that he sends are not enough to pay for necessities. Salima has 3 children. One of her daughters is mentally retarded and sits at home. Salima tries anything that might bring extra income. She specializes in sale of dried fruits (apricots and prunes). During the summer, when melons and watermelons appear on the market, Salima switches to sell them. Salima\u2019s older daughter helps her mother to sell. Over the 5 months of being a MicroInvest borrower, Salima demonstrated that MicroInvest loans made a noticeable difference in her business. Salima plans to continue her relationship with MicroInvest, as the loans she receives help her sustain her business.<p><b>Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk, Kiva

And he was left alone, with his unfulfilled dreams. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> He fell into depression for some time, but Humberto realized that there was a strong reason to live and keep going: Hip\u00f3lita, his little sister, who needed his support and love and lives with him. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> Humberto sells -door to door- nutritional supplements from Tien, a well known Peruvian brand. He wishes to widen the variety of products he offers to increase his sales. So he is asking for a loan of US$ 325.  This amount will be invested in more Tien products to be sold. The increased income would help him support his sister and his parents. He would repay it in 6 months.

This is 58-year-old Msiba S. from Dar es Salaam. She is a widowed woman with four children between the ages of 19 and 27 years old; additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent because his parents do not take care of him. Msiba has been running a caf\u00e9 business since 1993. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches. The food is all-local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces. Msiba's business is doing well. She works at the business for four hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by one employee. Msiba currently earns about 100 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 350 USD in order to renovate her caf\u00e9 and to purchase additional cooking oil, wheat flour and maize flour. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Msiba thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":212180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To renovate her cafe and to purchase supplies in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-16T20:40:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Msiba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-30T21:35:32Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":41650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348052},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":41650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970635},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:17:17Z","rounded_local_amount":41650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886852},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:35Z","rounded_local_amount":41650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436112},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:45Z","rounded_local_amount":41650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130385},{"amount":34.99,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:05Z","rounded_local_amount":41650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027194},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":41650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613234},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":41650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010317},{"amount":35.01,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:57Z","rounded_local_amount":41650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232628},{"amount":35,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:15Z","rounded_local_amount":41650,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664444}],"funded_date":"2008-10-16T21:35:32Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":73028,"name":"Margaret","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret is a single mother with five children living in Musang, just outside Bamenda, Cameroon.

She has nine children; the three youngest live with her in the home she owns.  Thirty years ago, they went to the rainforest looking for work, never thinking of staying there, much less of buying land where they would make their home and convert the rest of the buildings into an area where trees could be cut and split, to convert them into lumber for woodworking.  She also maD. a zinc fence in order to store the lumber.  Santos and her husband work splitting the wood into 2, 3, and 4-inch width timbers which are 3.40 metres long.  Once they have a good stock of lumber, Santos offers it to carpenters although they usually work to order.  Santos is the bookkeeper for the business and her husband is in charge of bringing the trees and turning them into lumber; they have been doing this work for more than 12 years as it is a profitable business allowing them to support their family.  In addition, Santos prepares between 35 to 40 portions of pork cracklings in the afternoons, which she sells for 1.50 to 2 soles.  She has been doing so for roughly six years; this too is very profitable, as while she is selling the cracklings, she gathers the wood to dry it so that they can ask for a higher price than if the wood were still humid: carpenters always look for dry lumber when they make furniture as it will not warp.  This is Santos' fifth consecutive loan from MFP: she has always maD. her payments without difficulty and is committed to continue working with her community bank as she has done until now.  The loan will be used to buy trees for splitting, so that she will have equity in the lumber and have it ready for sale when her clients need it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":260039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Timber Sales","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To buy trees for splitting and resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-23T02:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.1,"local_amount":126,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:07:57Z","rounded_local_amount":138.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423667},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:40:45Z","rounded_local_amount":69.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116936},{"amount":22.04,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:44Z","rounded_local_amount":69.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011857},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:49Z","rounded_local_amount":69.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595451},{"amount":22.05,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":69.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989697},{"amount":22.06,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":69.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210820},{"amount":20.65,"local_amount":59,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:14Z","rounded_local_amount":64.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640434}],"funded_date":"2009-01-23T05:24:26Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}}]}
