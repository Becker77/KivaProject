It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor coverage of basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":320409,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase clothes in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T19:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sophia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:06:00Z","rounded_local_amount":402450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773308}],"funded_date":"2009-05-17T17:18:20Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:06:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":113028,"name":"Martha Petrona","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora Martha Petrona M.

The purchase of the scale would make things easier so she wouldn\u2019t have go to her neighbor\u2019s house to weigh her products; her main clients are the people in her community.  \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently she sells her products at home and has dreams of having a place next to her home to set up her business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lauren Jackson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":400593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase basic products: sugar, rice, beans, salt, oil, soap, milk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Nacajuca, Tabasco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Dorys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Santos ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":16000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1905.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1931.64},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1958.31},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1985.35},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2012.77},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2040.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2068.73},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2097.31}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.85},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150.91},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":153},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":155.1},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.42},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":161.62},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":452.48,"local_amount":5791.78,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":5852.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103794832},{"amount":155.38,"local_amount":1988.85,"processed_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2009.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110685987},{"amount":157.25,"local_amount":2012.77,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":2033.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110685988},{"amount":402.62,"local_amount":5153.5,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:52Z","rounded_local_amount":5207.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118080326},{"amount":82.27,"local_amount":1053.1,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1064.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123916652}],"funded_date":"2009-11-01T23:25:41Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:15:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lauren Jackson","image":null}},{"id":150022,"name":"Castulo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"C\u00e1stulo tiene 44 a\u00f1os, \u00e9l es un hombre con muchas ganas de salir adelante; auque es divorciado y no tiene hijos, siempre piensa en darles una mejor calidad de vida a sus padres, con ellos vive y con una prima, en una amplia casa ubicada en un populoso distrito de Lima.\n\nEste hombre trabajador se dedica a la venta de ropa, negocio que tiene en su casa y que desde hace 15 a\u00f1os lo mantiene muy bien.

Although divorced and childless, he strives to provide a better quality of life for his parents.  He lives with them and a cousin in a large house located in a populous district of Lima.  This hard-working man has sold clothing from his home for the past 15 years and has done quite well.  He buys clothing at wholesale and then sells to his customers who pay him at the end of the month.  This activity has allowed him to suffer no deprivations and has allowed him to buy the necessary appliances to furnish his home with a measure of comfort for his elderly parents.  Because C\u00e1stulo is an enterprising fellow, he also sells beer from his home, especially on week-ends when this beverage is more popular among his neighbors and friends.  Such is this man's life who learned very young to be a businessman and has learned to grow honestly thanks to his efforts and lots of work.  Nothing dissuades him from reaching his goals in life; he wants to become a great merchant and have his own clothing line as well as a well-stocked liquor store.  Some day, not too distant, he knows he will reach it with his effort and ability.\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP and he pledges to be responsible with his repayments because he knows there will be future loans which will allow him to grow economically.  He is also satisfied with the work and punctuality of his communal bank where most of his partners are women.  He has decided to spend these funds in the purchase of a larger quantity of Summer clothing since the season has begun and his customers are anxious to buy it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":420777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To increase his inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-05T19:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Castulo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":253.56,"local_amount":724.47,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":735.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734736},{"amount":6.77,"local_amount":19.34,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":19.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124097},{"amount":96.86,"local_amount":276.75,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:23Z","rounded_local_amount":280.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959801},{"amount":167.81,"local_amount":479.44,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":486.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717431}],"funded_date":"2009-12-02T20:34:20Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":154166,"name":"Savuth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Savuth N. lives in the village of Srae Srang in Takeo Province.

She is 33 years old, married and the mother of 5 children who are 16, 13, 11, 9 and 5 years old. All her children go to school. She is in 9th grade of night school because she couldn't finish school due to lack of financial resources. She lives in her own house with her family and supports two nephews who live with her. \r\n\r\nShe left the town of Matola to the Matola Rio district upon moving in with her husband in 2000. She has had her own business in her backyard for over 10 years. She doesn't have any employees and has an income of 3.500.00 to 4.000.00m per month, which goes to household expenses and she manages to save some money in her savings account. \r\n\r\nShe has never had loans with other banks. She came to know Hluvuku through her brother who is also a partner of the institution. This loan, in the amount of 20.000.00mt is her second. She intends to purchase merchandise (beer, sodas, juices, cookies and others) to increase and diversify her inventory. The previous loan was for 15.000.00mt and invested in the same activity. \r\n\r\nShe commits to paying this loan on time in order to be able to be granted other loans. In the future, she would like to request more loans to improve her business as a way of helping her husband with household expenses.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

(flasks, hot pots, mugs, plates, basins, hand bags, etc.).  She is married to a teacher and has two sons, ages 20 and 12, and one daughter, age 18.  She has been in business for 15 years and sells in the market center to local people, churches, and schools. Her primary challenges are low sales at different times of the month and competition from other businesswomen selling similar products. In addition to this business, she operates a transport minivan service (\"matatu\") on the Kakamega-Kitale route.\r\n\r\nJosephine plans to use her 50,000 KES loan to pay school fees for her son at University Egerton (20,000) and school fees for her daughter at KCA Nairobi (30,000). In the past, Josephine has successfully repaid a 150,000 KES loan.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Jospehine hopes her two children complete college and will be working.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a general store and a vehicle spare parts business. Her husband Ruben S., 42 years old, works as a conductor to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 3 children who are between the ages of 5 to 14 years old. \r\n\r\nJudilyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1996 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon,  Judilyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000 which she intends to use to buy more stocks for her vehicle spare parts business so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and to make repairs to her home. Judilyn S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The group is called Trabajando por el Futuro (Working for the Future) and comprises seven very responsible people who have decided to work for a better future so they are seeking a loan. Some wish to start a new business; others wish to invest in their current businesses. \r\n\r\n34-year old Zenobia fits into the latter category. She is married, has two children, and is the group\u2019s treasurer. She runs a small grocery store out of her house and plans to use the money to buy more merchandise such as yogurt, juice, soft drinks, and cookies. As well as running the store, she delivers bread in the mornings.\r\n\r\nZenobia and her husband work very hard and as a result have managed to buy a car which they use to provide a local taxi service. Her husband is responsible for paying for the children\u2019s education and food, while Zenobia is responsible for expenses such as electricity, water, telephone etc. She would love to buy a bigger vehicle, and this is one of the couple\u2019s goals. \r\n\r\nIn the photograph you can see the group members during the time of loan distribution in EDAPROSPERO\u2019s office. Some of their young children are also present. The two members on the extreme right and left have brought their mothers along.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":713362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy yogurt, juice, soft drinks, and cookies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huarochiri","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.916667 -76.416667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2011-02-16T16:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zenobia Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariluz Corazon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luis Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yarasca Arias Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan Katterine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":650},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-17T08:11:07Z","rounded_local_amount":656.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201269338},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:45:13Z","rounded_local_amount":656.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206136215},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:58:24Z","rounded_local_amount":656.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211208666},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":650,"processed_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-19T07:53:39Z","rounded_local_amount":656.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216969269}],"funded_date":"2011-02-17T21:27:34Z","paid_date":"2011-07-19T07:53:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":277773,"name":"Sun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sun V., 30, resides with her family in Takeo Province, Cambodia, an area known for its pre-Angkorean temples.

In spite of this she tries to meet the needs of her children alone, and they value their mother's efforts to give them an education. Because of this, Claudia leaves early in the morning for the hospital, where she has worked as a nutritionist for more than 27 years. Claudia is in charge of the menu for hospital patients. On finishing her shift, she goes to work at the recycling stand in the market, where she spends as much time as possible, especially on weekends and holidays. Claudia also spends her time selling beautify products, which she offers to clients and friends. In spite of these multiple efforts, Claudia isn't able to cover the costs of keeping a home, and above all to cover her children's university tuition. It is for this that Claudia is asking for a loan to invest in her recycling stand in order to satisfy the demand of her clients.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

Mercy thanks you for your support!\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":389860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To open the same business at new location","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-10-01T13:40:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:33:22Z","rounded_local_amount":135833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97023064},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":135833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868305},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:45Z","rounded_local_amount":135833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757501},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":135833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146595},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":135833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984740},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.35,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":135833.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015413}],"funded_date":"2009-10-01T19:37:34Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Sharfman","image":562243}},{"id":141786,"name":"Cornelio","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Cornelio is married and has one small son.

Adem\u00e1s presta el servicio de taxi durante las ma\u00f1anas y las tardes, hasta que su hija llega del colegio, pues en ese momento debe atenderla y ayudarla con sus tareas. \nHace 15 a\u00f1os que empez\u00f3 a dedicarse a este oficio porque sab\u00eda manejar autos y le pareci\u00f3 que podr\u00eda ser muy f\u00e1cil, pero el tiempo le ha demostrado que todo trabajo merece esfuerzo, y hoy tiene un doble esfuerzo porque el ser padre es una gran obligaci\u00f3n de la cual jam\u00e1s escap\u00f3, por lo contrario adora los momentos que pasa con la ni\u00f1a de sus ojos. \nA Juan le gusta salir a taxear en horas punta, pues le es muy rentable. Con este trabajo no tiene problemas econ\u00f3micos y le alcanza el dinero para vivir c\u00f3modamente al lado de su peque\u00f1a. Sabe que debe dar lo mejor de s\u00ed, es por eso que tiene planeado para el futuro comprar un auto m\u00e1s y brindarlo en alquiler, porque su mayor preocupaci\u00f3n es la educaci\u00f3n y el futuro de su hija, adem\u00e1s ella es el motor que lo impulsa a seguir trabajando diariamente.\n\nEste es su s\u00e9timo pr\u00e9stamo con MFP y ser\u00e1 responsable como en las anteriores ocasiones, ya que ese es el principal valor que le inculcaron desde ni\u00f1o. Le dinero que ahora solicita lo piensa invertir en la reparaci\u00f3n de su auto, para brindar seguridad a los diversos pasajeros que moviliza.","en":"Juan is a 51-year old man who spends his time working and caring for his small 6-year old daughter (Camila), with whom he passes his days between smiles and games in his modest house located to the south of the city of Lima. \r\n\r\nAs a good parent, he tries to raise his daughter correctly. Although he is separated from his partner, he does everything he can to fulfill the role of both father and mother.  He offers his taxi service during the mornings and afternoons, until his daughter arrives from school.  At that point he must attend to her and help her with her homework. It has been 15 years since he began in this trade, because he knew how to drive an automobile, and it seemed to him that it would be quite easy.  But over time he has found that all work takes effort, and now he has to double his efforts because to be a father is a big commitment from which one can never escape.  On the contrary, he loves the time he spends with the apple of his eye. \r\n\r\n Juan likes to go out with his taxi during peak hours, when it is very profitable.  With this work, he does not have economic problems and he is able to raise enough money to live comfortably with his daughter.  He knows that he must give his best, and for this reason he is planning to buy another car in the future and offer it for rent.  His main concern is for the education and future of his daughter.  In addition, she is the engine that drives him to continue working daily.  \r\n\r\nThis is his seventh loan with MFP and he will be responsible as in the previous occasions, since this is a principal value that was instilled in him from the time he was a child.  The money that he is requesting now will be invested in the repair of his auto, to provide security to the various passengers that he transports.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":420848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to repair his auto","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-05T21:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":296.03},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":309.8},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":326.35},{"due_date":"2010-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":339.41},{"due_date":"2010-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":358.53},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":369.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":103.61},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.43},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":114.22},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.8},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.48},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":103.61,"local_amount":296.03,"processed_date":"2009-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:18Z","rounded_local_amount":300.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843159},{"amount":212.04,"local_amount":605.83,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:13Z","rounded_local_amount":614.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734740},{"amount":10.61,"local_amount":30.32,"processed_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:41Z","rounded_local_amount":30.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124099},{"amount":118.8,"local_amount":339.41,"processed_date":"2010-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":344.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959805},{"amount":254.94,"local_amount":728.41,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:30Z","rounded_local_amount":739.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992650}],"funded_date":"2009-11-13T03:25:29Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":154182,"name":"Ngozi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ngozi is very hardworking; every single day, she makes sure that her family gets fed properly.

Probably the main factor driving these people to go forward is the sole conviction of these people that they deserve something better in this life than to just obtain allowances from Government and wait for better times. Maybe another factor which makes these people different from the crowd is their feeling of responsibility for the future of their children. They feel themselves responsible for building a decent life for the sake of the wellbeing of their children.\r\n\r\nAigul T., the leader of this group, is forty-three years old and is divorced. She has a daughter who has turned twenty-one and who works in a private company, obtaining a salary of $60.\r\n\r\nAigul trades in vegetables at the market and her income is somewhere around $175 a month. During summertime her daughter helps her in the business. Aigul started selling vegetables fifteen years ago. During this time she has been able to buy a two-room flat (apartment) and see her daughter married.\r\n\r\nAigul wants to expand her assortment of vegetables and therefore decided to apply for this loan. One of her future plans is to send her daughter to college.\r\n\r\nAigul\u2019s partners are:\r\n\r\nCholpon O., 41, is the mother of two children, both of whom go to school.

She and her husband have been able to buy a house, even though their salaries are not so high. Now Damira needs a loan to buy a circular.\r\n\r\nJuma M., 51, is a taxi-driver. He manages to earn two to three dollars a day. His spouse is a housewife and they have two children. His elder son is also a driver, working in the capital.

With the loan she wants to purchase more garments to give her business a new lease on life, which will improve her sales revenue and enable her to take care of her family.\r\n\r\nMaurice belongs to a group of members who insure and hold each other accountable in paying back the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4275,"image":{"id":579266,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more bales of clothes for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kihihi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"2 33","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-08-05T18:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4275,"lender_count":117,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maurice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manase","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Xavier","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marble","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faridah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Loy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Stephen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John Bosco","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Herbert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enock","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Godfry","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lauben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Valentine","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ritah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Allen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":9390000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1565000},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1565000},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1565000},{"due_date":"2010-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1565000},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1565000},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":1565000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":712.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":712.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":712.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":712.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":712.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":712.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":712.4,"local_amount":1564781,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1570842.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903704},{"amount":651.33,"local_amount":1430648,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1436190.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297171},{"amount":659.95,"local_amount":1449571,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":1455186.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467446},{"amount":654.48,"local_amount":1437565,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1443133.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605536},{"amount":664.89,"local_amount":1460435,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1466092.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188744668},{"amount":878.83,"local_amount":1930333,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:05:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1937810.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191482857},{"amount":53.12,"local_amount":116667,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T09:00:05Z","rounded_local_amount":117118.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195910139}],"funded_date":"2010-08-14T07:44:31Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T09:00:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":224516,"name":"Ritchel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ritchel N. is a married woman who lives in Brgy.

Her husband Melvin, who is 40 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have three children who are aged one to 15 years old. \r\n\r\nRitchel joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 20 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 8,500 PHP, thus uplifting her family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 21st cycle loan, she is borrowing 49,500 PHP, with which she intends to purchase more stock for her sari-sari store (a neighborhood general store) so that she can continue to save up for the future and the education of her children.  Ritchel is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

The remainder will be invested in their business.       \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1750,"image":{"id":230434,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy potatoes, cassava and bananas ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1750,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Safoura  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"N\u00e8n\u00e8  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":128571.43},{"due_date":"2008-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":128571.43},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":128571.43},{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":128571.43},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":128571.43},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":128571.43},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":128571.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":128571.43,"processed_date":"2008-11-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":129002.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5351000},{"amount":250,"local_amount":128571.43,"processed_date":"2008-12-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:36:19Z","rounded_local_amount":129002.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974114},{"amount":250,"local_amount":128571.43,"processed_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":129002.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889490},{"amount":250,"local_amount":128571.43,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:14:46Z","rounded_local_amount":129002.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440283},{"amount":250,"local_amount":128571.43,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:11:54Z","rounded_local_amount":129002.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135651},{"amount":250,"local_amount":128571.43,"processed_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:34:26Z","rounded_local_amount":129002.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033452},{"amount":250,"local_amount":128571.42,"processed_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:43:18Z","rounded_local_amount":129002.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620819}],"funded_date":"2008-12-09T06:25:00Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T02:43:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Llewellyn","image":44015}},{"id":80292,"name":"Krous","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Krous S. is a villager in Siem Bouy village in Kampong Cham province.

In 2007, she started operating a food stall selling vegetables, bread, milk, and other foods to make money to feed her sons. In June 2008, she expanded her business by opening a general store in the yard in front of her house. She also receives 54,000 MNT (about $35-40 USD) a month from the government as a pension for her husband's death. Battogtoh lives in a traditional Mongolian ger about 130 km from Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. She and her sons built the new store themselves. Both of her sons -- aged 12 and 16 -- go to school and help run the family business.  When Battogtoh goes to the market to buy goods, her eldest son works at the store and her youngest son goes with her to help carry the goods. The average daily income in the store is 30,000-50,000 MNT (about $20-40 USD), which mostly comes from selling milk, cigarettes, and bread. Most of the store's customers are Battogtoh's neighbors. This 400,000 MNT loan is the second loan she has taken from XacBank, Kiva's Mongolian microfinance partner. Battogtoh is a very open and active person. She now plans to renovate the structure housing her store.

After three years as an apprentice to his older brother, he now works on his own, in a workshop located in the Alamoussala neighborhood. He is very much in demand due to his creative genius.\r\n\r\nTo increase his working capital and generate more income, he is requesting a first individual loan from Soro Yiriwaso, with which he will buy a sewing machine.\r\n\r\nHe gets his supplies from the area. Mr. Abdrahamane B. provides his services for cash or on credit, to a customer base of both men and women. With this loan, he hopes to attain monthly earnings of 65,000 FCFA.

J., 28 years old, is married to Philip S. J., a driver. The couple is blessed with only one son. These young parents are very industrious and full of dreams. They wish to have a stable business, to build their own house, to send their only child to a better school and to live comfortably and happily. It was 2008 when she joined Ahon sa Hirap, Inc. (ASHI), partner Microfinance Institution of KIVA in the Philippines. She joins ASHI and KIVA because she believes that these institutions can help her achieve her dreams. When she received her loan she used it properly on farming and now she earns a profit. She also maintains very good performance and shows discipline as a member. She is rewarded for her effort. Now, she is applying again for a new loan to use towards their rice field production. This loan will be used to purchase sacks of organic fertilizers, pesticides and to pay for the farm labor. The income from this business will help the couple in their daily needs and in preparation for the future of their children. The couple's plan is to expand their business and to seek an additional income generating project venture in the near future. They are hoping that ASHI and KIVA will always support their plan and their financial needs to be freed from the cycle of poverty.

She is married and has 3 children, all of who have their own familes. Only one of them lives with her.   \r\n\r\nShe is from the city of San Antonio. She has always been a merchant; she would buy and sell merchandise in a variety store and as a street vendor. Later, little by little she saved up and decided to outfit a well supplied convenience store in her home. That way, she wouldn't have to leave her house and she could spend more time with her family. Her husband is not working at this time due to his age, but he helps her attend to the business, which they have had now for 25 years.\r\n\r\nShe has turned to loans because it allows her to keep costs down by buying merchandise up front.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

This is 32-year-old Stela D. from Mwanza. She is married and has five children, who are between the ages of 9 and 15 years old. Since 2000, Stela has made a living running a grocery store where she sells  onions, tomatoes, chilli and cabbages. It is the kind of place that local people send their children running to when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and need a missing ingredient.\r\n\r\nShe works at this business for six hours per day, seven days per week. Stele earns about $100 a month from her business, and is requesting a loan of $200 to buy bananas, tomatoes and cabbages. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Stela thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":350615,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy bananas, tomatoes and cabbages.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-07-10T16:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Stela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.73},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":27272.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.73},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:44Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73665061},{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:25Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105773},{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:27:15Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022883},{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868124},{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:39Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757320},{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:28Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146414},{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:52Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984575},{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015261},{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740278},{"amount":22.73,"local_amount":27272.73,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773409},{"amount":22.7,"local_amount":27272.7,"processed_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:06:05Z","rounded_local_amount":29795.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151956406}],"funded_date":"2009-07-10T19:02:18Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:06:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joe Castrovinci","image":442131}},{"id":125364,"name":"Adelfa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adelfa R. is a 39-year-old mother of five.

He lives in his parents' house and what he most wants is to be able to give them a peaceful old age.\r\n\r\n Jos\u00e9's days start very early, by 6 in the morning he leaves with his inseperable tricycle in search of clients to offer his transportation service.  The markets and busiest places in the city of Juliaca are the main areas that he works since he knows many people there need his services.\r\n<p>\r\nWhat he enjoys most about his job is that he gets to travel through the streets of the city while at work.  He has been doing this for four years and he considers the most difficult part of his jobs are the long hours at night, running the risk of having his tricycle stolen. He is willing to sacrifice a lot for his job. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future he wants to have a business that his parents can take care of, perhaps a grocery store, where they could work without too much effort.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP, and he knows to pay all of his dues on time like he did last time.  He is very responsible in his village bank and he does not want to look bad in front of the other members. With the loan of 1000 soles he will buy new tires for his tricycle, since he has been using them a long time and he can no longer travel the  speed he used to.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

They are on average 45 years old with 5 children and live in the M\u00e9dine district of the town S\u00e9gou (4th administrative area of the Republic of Mali.) They know each other from the neighborhood and family ties. They all do business with various goods. It is in the hopes of increasing and varying their business that they decided to work with the micro-finance non-profit Soro Yiriwaso.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter six repaid team loans, the Yelenkoura group is on to its 7th loan. This loan would be used to buy food condiments (4 large boxes of condensed tomatoes, 2 bags of cooking salt, 1 box on bouillon cubes, 20 kg of dah seeds) ; various goods to display ( 1 bag of sugar, about ten packets of tea that is highly regarded by their customers, 4 boxes laundry soap, 1\/2 box mosquito repellent spirals); 40 bags of charcoal; 4 bags of millet, 1 bag of powdered baobab fruit and the ingredients for dried cream.\r\n<p>\r\nThey supply themselves with the food condiments and various goods in Bamako, the charcoal is made on site, the carriers for large goods come from Fana. The millet and the powdered baobab fruit come from the market in Medine. To make dried cream: you must grind the millet to a fine flour, roast a part of this millet, remove the bran, and wash it well. To that we add oven-dried rice and powdered baobab fruit and sift it several times. Add the needed ingredients and reduce them to a flour. Mix well and let them dry in required hygienic conditions. The seeds of the dah are modified into \"datou\" used in our sauces instead of \"sounbala.\"\r\n<p>\r\nThe sales are done from home, in the from of house deliveries, at market, and retail by cash or credit. The customers are made up of both women and men. They hope to earn on average 55.00 FCFA monthly, which would repay the interest on the loan, cover the cost on the goods, the purchase of school stationary and soap, and enable them to participate in social events. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Colleen Creegan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":429499,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"The purchase of varrious goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintou     \t       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aminata      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou             ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Penda      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djelika      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":107142.86},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":107142.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.43},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.43},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.43},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.42},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.43},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":246.43,"local_amount":107142.86,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:03:44Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763561},{"amount":246.43,"local_amount":107142.86,"processed_date":"2010-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:12Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152392},{"amount":246.43,"local_amount":107142.86,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991234},{"amount":246.42,"local_amount":107142.86,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:53Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021504},{"amount":246.43,"local_amount":107142.86,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:02Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746306},{"amount":246.43,"local_amount":107142.86,"processed_date":"2010-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778858},{"amount":246.43,"local_amount":107142.84,"processed_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:30Z","rounded_local_amount":108684.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961107}],"funded_date":"2009-12-18T19:34:34Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Colleen Creegan","image":367715}},{"id":158347,"name":"Sonia Alberta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sonia is a single mother who opened a bakery 16 years ago as a way to support her two children.

She has been managing a water station while also renting out some apartment rooms. These two activities make up her total income per month. She also does a little food vending while maintaining her two main businesses.\r\n\r\nLuz has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her businesses.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a 45,000 Philippine peso loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business by allowing her to pay for maintenance and repairs for her apartments. She will also pay for the needs and bills of the water station and buy groceries to replenish her current product stock.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her businesses will continue to grow.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":519715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Water Distribution","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Maintenance and repair for her apartments, to pay for needs and bills of the water station and to buy groceries to replenish her current product stock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-04-08T19:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1875},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1875}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.7},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.7},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.7},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.7},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":256.25,"local_amount":11250,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":11494.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136652053},{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:00:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3831.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144684662},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:35:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7663.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152028563},{"amount":85.42,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3831.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159607986},{"amount":427.08,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":19157.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166821518}],"funded_date":"2010-04-13T19:43:42Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":195872,"name":"Rebecca","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rebecca is a 31-year-old hardworking lady.

She earns her living by operating a tailoring\/sewing business. Her husband Benjamin, who is 55 years old and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have nine children who are between 14 and 32 years old. Felisa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Felisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000 to use as funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for her children's education. Felisa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from her maize sales, Linet will educate her children.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Jaribu Women group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nThe photograph shows Linet and her group with the field officer who is on the far left.\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":930737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Webuye","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.616667 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ailen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatrice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Caro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manea","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":368009,"name":"Celsa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celsa works hard to support her family.

was inspired to improve her farming business when her friends told her about Juhudi Kilimo and the partnership they have with Kiva to support marginalized women smallholder farmers. Juhudi Kilimo was established with a mission to uplift, empower, and validate women across Kenya. \n\nLucy is a farmer from Maara, a remote village in Chuka, Kenya, who believes that agriculture is not just for the older generation. She is a loving mother who has farmed for five years so that she can supplement her income from the small \u201cside hustles\u201d she does. Lucy grows crops and raises goats. She enjoys farming. Her biggest challenges are the lack of finances and fighting diseases. She will use the loan to purchase dairy goats.

Jane, who is an ever-smiling farmer, has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans that farming is only for the large scale farmers because although she is a smallholder farmer she is making progress. She passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early-riser and she wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cow. Although this humble mom has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she wants to diversify her product portfolio and start cereal selling business. Her remote village has a high demand for cereals the only problem is the unwilling nature of financial institutions to fund smallholder farmers but she is not worried because Juhudi Kilimo has provided the platform to help smallholder farmer like him access credit facilities. She is kindly requesting for a loan to buy cereals so that she can sell and meet the demand in her village and markets nearby.

In fact, this village is the source of vegetables for the hotels in Cap Skirring.  The dissatisfaction of the hotels and the fact that the demand exceeds the supply drives hotels, for example the Club Med, to purchase their fresh produce in Dakar [Senegal\u2019s capital, a two day\u2019s journey from Boucotte Ouolof].

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":6865,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of gardening equipment and seeds; installation of drip irrigation system; transportation to market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Boucotte Ouolof","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.416389 -16.750556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2006-12-09T01:33:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ousmane","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-12-25T01:26:06Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1375,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-04-21T21:05:59Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13450},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T21:00:38Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16986},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T21:06:33Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":17001},{"amount":250,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2007-07-22T20:42:24Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34433},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T04:03:47Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41462},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T17:04:58Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50201},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:31:07Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63329},{"amount":125,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:34:29Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":125,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80033},{"amount":375,"local_amount":375,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:35:46Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:38:49Z","rounded_local_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93772}],"funded_date":"2006-12-11T01:26:06Z","paid_date":"2007-12-08T21:35:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":6572,"name":"Margerete","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maggie is a client of Kraban Support Foundation and has been educated in the TEACH Lending program.

He is in the livestock business. He purchases and sells livestock. He goes through this cycle every 2-3 months. Selling livestock doesn't provide him with a continuous flow of income. In the beginning, it is necessary to feed the livestock for a a few months so that it reaches its slaughter weight. After that, it is ready to be put up for sale. And only after that process, it is possible to obtain a profit after the sale of livestock. But since 3 months is a long time, Muzaffar also sells produce at the marketplace, which provides him with a constant flow of income. It is profitable for him to have two businesses, with which both his wife and older son help him out.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":241747,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"For business expenssion","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2008-12-22T06:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muzaffar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":571.43},{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":571.43},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":571.43},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":571.43},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":571.43},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":571.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":571.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":171.43,"local_amount":571.43,"processed_date":"2009-01-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-19T09:06:55Z","rounded_local_amount":583.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10229614},{"amount":171.43,"local_amount":571.43,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:19:22Z","rounded_local_amount":583.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20427128},{"amount":171.43,"local_amount":571.43,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":583.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27120637},{"amount":171.42,"local_amount":571.43,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":583.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36015756},{"amount":171.43,"local_amount":571.43,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:17:12Z","rounded_local_amount":583.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599490},{"amount":171.43,"local_amount":571.43,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-30T07:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":583.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52993933},{"amount":171.43,"local_amount":571.42,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":583.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215203}],"funded_date":"2008-12-28T05:23:41Z","paid_date":"2009-10-06T11:07:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vasilisa Budnikova","image":387310}},{"id":84420,"name":"Francisca Eufemia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nEn el mercado municipal de Chichigalpa, la se\u00f1ora Francisca S. se dedica a su actividad de venta de carne ofreci\u00e9ndola en su establecimiento el cual es muy visitado frecuentemente por los clientes que a diario compran la carne.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising chickens for sale.  M\u1ef5 has been engaged in this business for over 11 years and earns approximately 1500000 VND a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, M\u1ef5 joined TYM Fund to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  M\u1ef5 has successfully repaid a previous loan from TYM Fund.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby chickens to raise & sell in the future.  M\u1ef5 is now requesting a new loan of 15000000 VND, which will be used to build a shelter for her chickens.  The loan will be the seventh loan taken out by the borrower from TYM Fund.  M\u1ef5 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her

He has been a struggling father who has made every effort to educate his children and provide for their needs and necessities. He has lost so many lives in the family: his mother and dad, brothers, and a sister. This has forced him to take on additional burdens in taking care of their children and grandchildren. Faced with the these challenges, the need arose for him to join a financial institution from which he could borrow money and help make ends meet. Encouraged by his friends, and fueled by the need for more capital for his business, he joined GHAPE. Since then, he has benefited immensely from the organization.\r\n<p>\r\nIf he is approved for his fourth loan, J. plans to invest in the selling of beer and the rearing of pigs. More specifically, he will buy piglets, pigs, and pig feed. Experience has taught him how to manage a business like this. The business site is located in a very good area, and pigs are in high demand as their meat is used for many social occasions such as marriages and funeral ceremonies\r\n<p>. \r\nJ. loves GHAPE because of the low interest and the social interactions among members. \r\n<p> \r\nAbout the Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE):\r\n<p>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and provides poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":350667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/

The family's main source of income is meat sales and she has been involved in this activity for the past 9 years working from 8 in the morning until 3 in the afternoon.  She has earned good profits.  All these years of work have turned her into quite the expert on meats and many of her customers prefer to buy from her because of the trust Gloria inspires in them.  She likes her work very much in that it allows her to socialize with her friends who always come to buy ingredients from her for their daily family meal preparation.  For the future, she would like to have a larger, better equipped, stand.  She knows, however, that little steps lead to big accomplishments so she works steadily and patiently waits for the improvements her business gets over time.  This is her second loan from MFP and she is very happy with the support she gets from her fellow members, all of whom are very punctual and good friends.

She is 46 years old and is married with 5 children aged 14 to 31.  Garmai did not have the opportunity to go to school due to poverty.\r\n\r\nShe and her family live and work in the Old Road Community in Sinkor which is about 5 miles from downtown Monrovia, Liberia.  For 19 years, Garmai has been selling foodstuffs such as rice and oil. She buys her goods wholesale and sells them retail to residents of her community. Garmai started selling with 4000 Liberian Dollars and now has 20,000 Liberian dollars as working capital.  She interacts well with customers in order to encourage them to continue buying from her.  Garmai will use this loan to purchase more rice and oil.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only seven percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Nder is a tiny farming village on the southern edge of the Sahara desert, whose colorful history as the capital of the ancient Wolof kingdom of Walo is still celebrated in Senegalese folklore.  In this arid region, profitable cultivation of Nder\u2019s main crops of yams and peanuts relies on irrigation, but capital for investment in irrigation pumps has always been scarce.  The ND.\u00e8ne association therefore submitted the following application for a microfinance loan: <p>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe state having established a general support framework for community development associations since the 1960\u2019s, our group quickly realized that grassroots community development will not be a reality unless our members are effectively mobilized and organized for this purpose.  Taking into account the extremely difficult socioeconomic context characterized by: 1) migration out of rural areas due to the lack of promising local development alternatives, and 2) The absence in the Di\u00e9ri zone of any hydro-agricultural system established by the state or managed by the local government, the group rolled up our sleeves and decided to rely on our own efforts and on those of our strategic partners in order to achieve our goals. <p>\r\nThe purpose of this loan is to provide the members of the group with a motorized irrigation pump with a capacity of 300m3\/hour, which can irrigate 10 hectares of fields and will be managed by a pump attendant who will ensure its maintenance and proper functioning.\r\nThe team responsible for this project will keep track of its progress and will begin to repay the loan without difficulty as soon as the first harvests begin.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nOriginal French : <p>\r\n\r\n\u00ab L\u2019\u00e9tat ayant d\u00e9fini le cadre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019intervention des associations de d\u00e9veloppement depuis les ann\u00e9es 1960, \u00e0 cet effet le groupement a vite compris que le d\u00e9veloppement \u00e0 la base ne sera une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 que si les membres ne seront fortement mobilis\u00e9s en s\u2019organisant en cons\u00e9quence.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":6888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Irrigation pump purchase","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Nder","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.255 -15.887222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2006-12-11T16:08:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mamadou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-12-27T03:13:37Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":975,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-07-22T16:39:43Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34387},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T03:56:37Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41420},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T16:58:03Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50156},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:21:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63297},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:25:29Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":79994},{"amount":815,"local_amount":815,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:30:29Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-11T18:39:02Z","rounded_local_amount":815,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93741}],"funded_date":"2006-12-13T03:13:37Z","paid_date":"2007-12-08T21:30:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":6588,"name":"Santi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Santi is a 27 year old mother of 3 children.
