She was born in the Panfilovskoye village, in a simple family of a farmer with five children.  Since childhood, she has been helping her mother with taking care of the house and the younger children.  Zarina was accepted into the Architectural University in 2002, where she studied for five years, and in 2007, Zarina returned to her parents in her native village.  In 2008, Zarina got married at the age of 23.  Her first daughter was born a year after that, in 2009, and then another daughter one year later.  In search of a source of income for her family, Zarina and her husband decided to purchase a retail space in the Kainda village in 2010.  Having invested an initial capital, the young family bought out the retail space and purchased a new inventory of merchandise.  At the present time, thanks to Zarina's love of hard work and persistence, her store yields about 12,000 som (KGS) per month.  In order to further develop her business, Zarina requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to expand the assortment of merchandise.  She plans to invest the profits into refilling her merchandise inventories and updating her retail equipment.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":940336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to broaden an assortment of goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Zhayilma village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-13T21:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zarina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":7473},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":7408},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":7599},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7795},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":7997},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8203},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8415},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8633},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":8856},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9084},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9319},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":9218}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":159.27},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":163.38},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":167.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":171.94},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":176.36},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":180.93},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":185.6},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":190.41},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.3},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200.36},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":160.67,"local_amount":7473,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:58Z","rounded_local_amount":7522.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250722537},{"amount":159.27,"local_amount":7408,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:41:20Z","rounded_local_amount":7457.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257125473},{"amount":163.38,"local_amount":7599,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:43:18Z","rounded_local_amount":7649.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263250628},{"amount":167.59,"local_amount":7795,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":7846.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269975599},{"amount":171.94,"local_amount":7997,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:14:48Z","rounded_local_amount":8050.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276816176},{"amount":176.36,"local_amount":8203,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:05:55Z","rounded_local_amount":8257.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283072210},{"amount":1150.79,"local_amount":53525,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:30:18Z","rounded_local_amount":53879.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287370773}],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T14:31:37Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T08:30:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":372511,"name":"Nadia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nadia is a 25-year-old married woman with three children, not in school.

She also looks after 13 dependents: 10 are orphans. Three children are from his brother, who together with his wife died of AIDS in 2002. Another seven children are from another brother who had two wives, of which one passed away. The brother is currently on antiretroviral drugs (drugs that boost immunity of people living with HIV\/AIDS). She is also living with her grandmother and her nephew (whose mother is Eunice\u2019s sister) and depends on her for clothing and education.  \r\n                                                                           \r\nEunice started her business in 1995 after having finished a hairdressing course from Pilkington College in Kampala, Uganda. There she got a certificate in hairdressing. After completion of her course, her husband bought her a dryer, blowdryer, rollers, five chairs, a sink and hair-relaxing chemicals so that she could start a salon. Her husband told her that he had loaned her the items so she had to pay him back. Since Eunice had already saved Ksh. 35,000 (USD 500) through the selling of clothes and shoes in 1993 and 1994, she had no problem repaying the items within two years. The business was doing well until  February this year when a fire broke out at her business premises. Seemingly good samaritans, who came in the pretext of helping her, stole her possessions including her dryer, blowdryer, sink, plastic chairs, mirrors and hair chemicals.

In addition, they also sell clothing and cups.\r\n<p>In order to keep up with ever-increasing customer demand, the group has decided to get help from the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution, with whom they are on their third solidarity (or group) loan. All of their previous loans have been repaid in full. They are planning to use this loan to purchase 938 kg of fresh fish and 35 cakes of ice. They purchase their fresh fish from the fishermen on-site on the banks of the Niger River in Markala. Some of the fish is sold while it\u2019s fresh and some is smoked in a converted area on the family land in buildings specially designed for this job. The women take the smoked fish to Bamako (the capital of Mali) to be sold to resellers wholesale and for cash. When they return from Bamako they buy clothing and cups that they will sell in the markets of Markala, Niono, and Siribala to a customer base made up of men and women.\r\n<p>They each hope to make an average monthly profit of 40,000 FCFA which will be used to pay the interest on the loan and to take care of their extended family.

Since she got married, she has focused on providing the best care to her husband and their 8 children, most of whom are already married, and now only the last three live with Rosa. To meet the needs of so many people, Rosa had to engage in various activities, and she is now dedicated to selling food. Her job is to prepare food in the morning, and then take it to her customers.  Most of Rosa's clients are masons, so Rosa drives to various construction sites to sell lunches. \r\n\r\nThis is her schedule Monday through Friday, which leaves time in the evening to attend to her home, since some of her children are still small. Lately, however, Rosa has noticed that her household expenses are increasing due to the rising prices of food, but since Rosa has a deal with her customers to charge them at the end of the month, Rosa cannot increase the price of her meals. \r\n\r\nRosa is now carefully expanding her home to install a restaurant inside, because she already has the necessary  furniture, and could then stop moving from one place to another. This is her third loan with MFP, and along with her companions who form her community bank, Rosa works with responsibility in order to not harm her image within the organization.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Since he wife died, he has had to be both a father and a mother for his 3 children whom he treasures.  They live in their own house located in the cental jungle of Peru.

Since then, and for ten years now, he has worked growing plantains, citrus fruits and other crops on his own land as well as on some rented land.   His oldest son helps him in the business, and the work has been good for them both.  Thanks to the business, he and his family are moving forward together.

O. is a tenacious 40 year old woman.  She has three children; 21, 18, and 11 years old.  She lives in the Nueva Jerusal\u00e9n neighborhood in the Soledad-Atl\u00e1ntico municipality.  That is where she has her business of selling varied merchandise directly and through specialized guides.  She also makes food on the week ends and for holidays.\r\n\r\nShe started as a businesswoman because she was a housewife without a life partner.  Even though she had worked previously as an employee, she decided to work on her own.  She did this in order to be able to be close to her children while raising them and to share more time with them.  Bernudis has had various businesses.  In the beginning she sold frozen chicken, and she added a restaurant to this business.  She had to close it because the fixed prices increased, and the customers stopped coming due to the increase in the price of the lunches.\r\n\r\nThat was when, five years ago, she decided to start her food business in her house in the Nuevo Jerusal\u00e9n neighborhood.  She sells \u201challacas\u201d (cornmeal, meat, and vegetables wrapped in banana leaves), pastries, and appetizers on the week ends.  She combines this with her general merchandise sales.  Her profits help her support her family.  She says that being a businesswoman has changed her life.  In addition to giving her independent income, it has given her autonomy and allowed her to buy assets.  She bought a freezer and shelving for her restaurant.\r\n\r\nShe has had four loans with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.  She is an outstanding client with her punctual payments.  She is currently applying a fifth time for 2,000,000 COP to buy merchandise on order; especially sheets, footwear, and cosmetics.\r\n\r\nHer main goal is to support the education of her children.  Later, when the children have been prepared, she will start a family pharmacy where she will not have to offer credit.  Even though she has learned to select her customers, she must make a greater effort with charged accounts.  Her biggest challenge is making this dream of working in a family pharmacy a reality.  She realizes that you cannot start this business with little money.  Therefore, she needs to work hard and wait a long time.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

His inventories include perfume, clothing, and watches. He has always liked sales and wants to earn extra income. For three years, Ramon has been selling these brand-name items to family, friends, and his growing clientele. He buys his inventory in bulk so that he can resell them at discounted prices. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ramon will be able to buy more inventories. He will be able to reach out to more customers and further expand his business. He supports himself, his wife, and their two children.\r\n\r\nRamon has had two previous loans from ACCION USA, which helped him get his business started. With his third loan, he plans to add to his inventory and increase sales. In the future, he hopes to open a storefront and maintain a stable business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3700,"image":{"id":556047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

He has been in business as a miller for 7 years and has a very good reputation in Bagadadji, his place of work.  His clientele is due to the quality of service he provides.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet customer demand, he has requested help from Soro Yiriwaso to buy a new mill (huller).

Some members only emigrated recently while others--Marie, for example--emigrated several years ago.  They live in a neighborhood of Puerto Plata, a city with an economy that depends on real estate, the country's largest rum factory and the tourist trade (which has taken a beating recently as other tourist areas have become more attractive).  Marie is a single mother with 7 children, 4 of whom still live with her.  She tells us that the greatest danger or challenge for her has been to survive in a strange country because of racism and the other barriers that she faces as an illegal immigrant from another country.  Her favorite activity is going to church to praise the Lord and read the Bible.\r\n\r\nMarie is excited to get this second loan from Esperanza Internacional.  She met the terms for the first loan and has made great strides in growing her business.  She has operated the business for around 10 years.  She started with a small loan from a friend and bought merchandise to resell.  She plans to use the new loan to buy rice, cooking oil, sugar and fruit juices.  The business is called a \"colmado\", a small store that stocks everyday items.  Marie plans to use her earnings to complete the process of applying for residency in the Dominican Republic.  She hopes to be able to return to Haiti to visit her family and help provide for

It's not surprising, then, to find that Mary has her own dressmaking workshop.  She also has a store where she sells handicrafts that is well-known in the region.  Her family includes her husband and 3 children aged 12 to 24 years.  One of her children is in school, and the other 2 are working independently; they have chosen to develop their autonomy in the face of all that life presents them.\r\n\r\nMary started her dressmaking and handicraft businesses 23 years ago.  She learned to sew from her uncle, and perfected her techniques through training at SENA.  She strengthened her business through loans from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, from which she has received 2 loans.  With this loan from Kiva she will buy handicrafts and supplies for her sewing workshop.  This is a safe investment because she works based on orders from her customers, particularly in the seasons when there is the most tourism in her area.  Mary Luz tells us that the loans have increased her working capital and her profits, which has allowed her to improve her home and buy household goods needed by her family.  Her dream is to keep increasing her profits through disciplined work, so that she can make improvements to her home until it is absolutely beautiful.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":760548,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She makes them in her small workshop, that she set up in her own house. Every job is ordered in advance by each institution independently. She got started in this business thanks to the fact that her husband is a policeman. This is how she ventured into this line of business, and today she is sought after because of her good workmanship. \r\n\r\nShe has been doing this work for more than five years. What she likes about it, is that she can be busy and feel productive. In the future she wants to be a small entrepreneur, and do what she likes to do, which is sewing. What she doesn't like is when she sells on credit and some of her clients are late in paying.  She plans to continue improving her business, expanding the workshop, and hiring staff to help her.\r\n\r\nThis will be the third loan with MFP. She feels good about the work of her communal bank, and wishes to continue having this support.

In this round of funding she would like to borrow 6,000,000, part of which will be used to invest in buying more pigs to raise.

At 23 years old she already has a business, which she runs with her mother.  She lives with her mother in a rented house and works very hard to improve her economic situation.  It has been three years since Gladis began working hard with her mother.  They sell clothes every weekend at the Sunday market.  She really likes selling clothes, especially to her regular clients.  She is very happy and fun and the clothes that she sells are good quality.  She would like her business to prosper and grow.  The most difficult obstacle is purchasing the clothes.  She prides herself on buying only the best clothes to sell, which has earned her a good reputation and helped to increase her sales.  This is Gladis' first loan with MFP.  She is one of the youngest members of her community bank and has the support of the other members, all of whom would like to see her succeed.  With the money from the loan she will purchase more merchandise, which will cost approximately 500 nuevos soles ($175 USD).\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Matthew Raimondi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":271198,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To increase her inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gladis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117056},{"amount":29.04,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:43:55Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011969},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:18Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595554},{"amount":29.05,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989816},{"amount":29.06,"local_amount":83,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":94.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210952},{"amount":29.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:16Z","rounded_local_amount":96.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640457}],"funded_date":"2009-02-16T12:23:38Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Matt Raimondi","image":549898}},{"id":93032,"name":"Gerardo Eloy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or Gerardo M. es un se\u00f1or emprendedor que no quiere que su familia se alarme con esta crisis, si no que el tiempo transcurre y no hay quien lo pare.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She hopes that this mobility will give her an edge and add to her sales.

They own the land that they cultivate, and they also rent other lands to increase their production.  When she harvests the peas and flowers she must select them for their quality and size, but this is a simple process.  After the harvest she must fertilize with compost to avoid being invaded by pests and to generate the most income when the products are brought to market.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Nimia is thinking of buying more land so that she could avoid having to rent land.  This way she could cultivate in larger quantities to obtain higher earnings to help her get ahead.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP, and she is very happy because she likes to work with the other members of her communal bank, who share her desire to succeed.

Justamente para este negocio julia solicita a la fundaci\u00f3n financiamiento por valor de $2.300.000, para comprar mercanc\u00edas como jeans, sabanas, toallas, camisa  de colegios, blusas, a solicitud de los clientes que tiene en diversos barrios de la ciudad. \nJulia desarroll\u00f3 su capacidad emprendedora desde cuando ten\u00eda una tienda con su esposo,  considerado por ella un buen negocio pero muy esclavizante, mon\u00f3tono y no acorde con su estilo de vida, ya que  ella so\u00f1aba con uno diferente, menos rutinario e innovador y donde sus hijas participaran como lo hacen ahora en  Variedades Sandy, por eso siente su actividad actual como su mas grande acierto. Cuando decidieron vender la tienda, se quedaron solo con dos vitrinas  y  un capital que fue  invertido en mercanc\u00edas econ\u00f3micas acorde a su sector objeto;  este negocio empez\u00f3 a funcionar muy bien y fue as\u00ed como a trav\u00e9s de una amiga que le recomend\u00f3 a la   Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  encontr\u00f3  la oportunidad de obtener un capital con bajos intereses, con \u00e9l  compr\u00f3 mercanc\u00eda para ampliar su negocio; su primer cr\u00e9dito fue en grupo y por un monto de $300.000; all\u00ed  recibi\u00f3 capacitaci\u00f3n con la cual aprendi\u00f3 el manejo del negocio  para lograr lo que hoy es,   \u201csu sue\u00f1o hecho realidad\u201d   en la actualidad tiene un cr\u00e9dito individual, pero ha recibido 14, con estos financiamientos ha logrado desarrollar su negocio y darle educaci\u00f3n a su hijos que est\u00e1n estudiando en la universidad dise\u00f1o de modas y administraci\u00f3n respectivamente; al mismo tiempo sus hijas trabajan con ella y son el tr\u00edo fant\u00e1stico, cada una   en su quehacer y entre las tres contribuyen al \u00e9xito del mismo.

R. is 50 years old and lives in the Milagro neighborhood in the city of Cartagena with her husband and 4 children aging from 24 to 30 years old. It is in this community that she has a business called Variedades Sandy where she sells all types of goods such as trousers, jeans, sheets, towels, school shirts and blouses for cash, although she also has some customers that she gives credit to. It is for this business that Julia is asking the financial foundation for $2.300.000, to buy goods such as jeans, sheets, towels, school shirts, blouses, at the request of the customers that she has in various neighborhoods of the city. \r\nJulia has been developing her entrepreneurial ability every since she had a shop with her husband, which she considered to be a good business but very time-consuming,monotonous and which did not agree with her lifestyle. She used to dream of something different, less routine and innovative and where her daughters participate as they do now at Variedades Sandy, therefore she feels her current business is a better decision. When they decided to sell the shop they were left with only two display cabinets and capital that was invested in economic goods in line with their goal sector. This business started to progress very well and it was through a friend who recommended the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation where she found the opportunity to get low interest capital, with which she bought goods to expand her business. Her first loan was in a group and for a total of $300.000. There she received training in business management to achieve what is today \u201cher dream become reality\u201d. Currently she has an individual loan, but she has received 14 and with these finances she has managed to develop her business and give her children an education - they are studying at university, fashion design and administration respectively; and at the same time her daughters work with her and they are the fantastic trio, each one in their own work and between the three of them they contribute to each others' sucess. Julia wants to project her business into new areas, and feels very happy with it. With her profits she has managed to build three apartments, she lives in one of them with her family, and the other two she rents which gives her additional income.  Also her business premises, which was at first in the living room of her home, is a product of the success that she has had working in her micro enterprise, and this is generated by the family union and the collective work directed towards the same activity and with unique family goals.  Julia is very grateful to the Foundation because they believed in them and because they helped to generate a positive impact for her children; it is important to point out that today they are partners of Variedades Sandy, and they feel proud of their parents and of the efforts that they made to achieve something that started out very small; as well the community acknowledges and supports this business as they know that Variedades Sandy fulfils an important role in society and it is there you find everyone. \r\n \r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Dent, Kiva

She is 50 years old, married, and has one adult-aged child. To make a living, Lorna operates a buying and selling business, buying agricultural crops like bananas, cassava and copra. She then transports these crops and sells them in the city. Lorna has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $50 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lorna joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase crops and also as additional working capital. Lorna is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase more agricultural crops to sell. This will be her 2nd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing 12,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy stocks for the general store and fertilizer for her sugarcane. Liberty wants to continue to save up for the future education of her children and to improve her business. Liberty M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n<p>\r\n<b> About NWTF<\/b><br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'honorable').

Francisca has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI that was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Francisca is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the thirteenth loan taken out by Francisca from ASKI.

At this time, she is working hard to send her children to school. This is a dream for most poor Filipino parents like Julita as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children.\r\n\r\nJulita operates a bicycle parts business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell them per item with a little profit. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options they are offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1000 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue her business operations, she is requesting a PHP 50,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nJulita dreams of being able to give all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God which she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance

of Central Asian countries are mostly involved in several industries like textile, food production, medicine and teaching. A big portion is on behalf of trade. \r\n\r\nNurgul, 43, has experience in borrowing loans because she started a business breeding and selling cattle in 1999 thanks to a loan borrowed from a local bank. Soon Nurgul purchased a small pavilion where she could promote and sell food products. She said that twelve years of experience in this business have taught her many lessons. Every day work and patience in the past do not allow her to make mistakes in the present. She shares her knowledge with younger generations, and it helps them not to repeat Nurgul\u2019s mistakes. Her monthly income generated from selling food products comprises 39,000 soms. Nurgul plans to use these funds plus those acquired from Kiva lenders for investing in goods circulation and in a purchase of a house. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\t\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

This will be Justina's third loan and she is very happy to know that she will have your support.  With her 1,500 soles, Justina will buy cacao seeds and thereby increase her production."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":889530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cacao seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-10-09T12:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1519.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097816}],"funded_date":"2011-10-10T03:51:15Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":347952,"name":"Otgonbileg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Otgonbileg is 52 years old and lives with her husband, two children and her granddaughter.

They average 26 years of age and two children and live in large traditional extended families in the Lafiala district of the city of Koutiala (Sikasso region, Republic of Mali).  They know one another through community ties and through work in almost the same business, namely making and selling soap.  The women are in high demand in this field of work and enjoy an unparalleled reputation.  \r\n<p>\r\nIn order to satisfy their ever-increasing number of customers, they decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso, with which they are on their fourth solidarity loan (group loan).  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.\r\n<p>\r\nThey plan to use this loan for buying barrels of waste oil and caustic soda.  The soap thus made is then sold wholesale and retail, cash or credit accepted, at the Koutiala marketplace and at the fairs of surrounding villages.  \r\n<p>\r\nThey each hope to realize an average profit of 200,000 francs CFA in the course of this cycle.  The funds will be used to pay the loan interest, to provide for the extended family, and to invest the rest in businesses.  Their ambition is to diversify and to open a modern workshop for making soap.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":271220,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy waste oil and caustic soda ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mon ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kamsa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":null,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":93048,"name":"Saing","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saing K., a 26-year-old farmer in Pursat Province, is married to Neoun, 22, who earns a living raising piglets behind the house.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Later he started working as an agricultural day laborer in his neighbors fields, and with his savings from this work he bought his own fields in which he plants all kinds of crops. Thanks to this, he has been able to pay off his debts and provide a good life for his family.\r\n\r\nHe also raises cows and sells their milk to his neighbors. Jose Rosel has planted corn on his land, and would like to use the most up-to-date fertilizers to grow his crops more efficiently, to get a better harvest. This is why he has found it necessary to ask for a loan of $2000 <i>nuevo soles<\/i> from Edpyme Alternativa.\r\n\r\nJose Rosel es an honorable and hard-working person.

S. is 38 years old and lives with her husband and two teenage children in Govi-Altai province, western of Mongolia. She and her family have been living in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent since 1995. Both her children attend a local middle school and her husband manages a taxi service in their town. Altantsetseg began her business in 1995. From 1988 through 1992, Altantsetseg attended a construction college majoring as a decorator and from 1993 to 1995, she worked as a shoe repairwoman in a local public service center. Since 2000, Altantsetseg has been working as a shoe repairwoman in the cold season and when the summer comes, she makes construction decorations in her town. In 2008, Altantsetseg received a 1,000,000 MNT loan from Xacbank in order to increase her business working capital. With her business revenues, she purchased two small cars. She attributes her business success to both her decorating and shoe repairing skills. Altantsetseg is a hard-working and optimistic woman who says, \"Our family is saving money to build a house in the coming year where we will be living more comfortably\". She is requesting a 1,500,000 MNT loan in order to purchase leather, fabric, heels and glue for her shoe repair

Her husband operates a transportation business using his own car to support the family. \r\n\r\nMunhtuya operates a consumer-goods business at a local market in the city. She started her retail trading business in 2009 and has found success within a short period.

Rosalinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Rosalinda is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell, like detergent & canned goods.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Thanks to both parents having their own microbusinesses, they can offer their children a life without worrying about basic necessities. They own a humble yet beautiful home, where Perla has her business, and her husband is a mototaxi driver. 5 years ago, Perla asked her husband to use a part of their home, that until then was used as the living room, to put in a small business and in this way help with the family income. In this store she sells basic, needed products such as sugar, noodles, and also candy, soda pop and fast food. Her customer service and administration of this new microbusiness made her business grow every day, to the point of having to expand her storefront. While she and her daughter are in chage of the business located in their home, Leonardo, with his motorbike, works as a mototaxi driver within the city and towards Posadas (Argentina). The couple asks for $1000 to invest in finishing the expansion of the store facility in order to be able to offer better service to their clients.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLa Sra.

He drives one of them and rents the other three for a fixed daily rate. In Kampala\u2019s highly competitive market with thousands of boda bodas, Thomas enjoys a steady business and has regular clients. He attributes this to keeping his vehicles clean and well-maintained, using drivers who are licensed, safe, polite and trustworthy and his requirement that they wear helmets. Thomas has been a boda boda driver for ten years.\r\n<p>\r\nThomas used his savings and a small loan from Pearl Microfinance to purchase his first motorbike four years ago. He has been using loans regularly since to expand his fleet and pay for routine maintenance and repair costs. Now, Thomas plans to sell his oldest bike, using the proceeds coupled with this loan to purchase a new one. He figures this will increase his daily revenue from 7,000 UXG to 10,000 UGX.\r\n<p>\r\nThomas depends upon his business profits to pay for his children\u2019s school fees and provide basic meals and clothing for his family.

Since she married her husband, a man who does agricultural work, they began to sow potatoes, peas, and corn on rented farms, for which they pay between 200 and 700 soles per year, depending on how accessible the farms by transportation. These prices are also determined by how the farms are irrigated; if the farms have irrigated land, then the price is higher than if the farms are irrigated by rain. Ovi wakes up very early in the morning to cook food, to take care of her baby, and then to give the rest to her husband, who works with the crops. Ovi loves her work. She doesn\u2019t feel tired or bored in cultivating her land, since a good harvest depends on this activity. She will sell her harvest in the market in the city of Tarma. This work is very profitable, and she plans to continue this so that she will be able to buy her own farms and her own house so she can offer her children a more comfortable life. This is her eighth loan with MFP, which demonstrates her honesty and responsibility in her repayments. She also likes to attend all of the community bank meetings, which are planned by her loan counselor, and to participate with good opinions. With the money that she is requesting, she will buy 10 sacks of chemical fertilizers and a bag of pea seeds to continue planting. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":352144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers and seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-14T17:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ovi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2055.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734036}],"funded_date":"2009-07-16T02:00:59Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":125832,"name":"Mar\u00eda Delfina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda Delfina A.

It belongs to the province of Lambayeque and is located one hour from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor more than eight years, Sebastiana has worked selling domestic birds and the meat of farm-raised chickens. She tells us that she had to begin working in this field since her husband works as a seasonal laborer, and the income he receives was not sufficient to cover the family's expenses. \r\n\r\nSebastiana buys live farm-raised chickens at the Moshoqueque market and takes them home where she raises them. She butchers them when there is customer demand and sells them by the kilo. At times, she also offers meat from pen-raised birds which she raises herself. The business provides great benefits not only for Sebastiana herself, but also for her neighbors, since their area is very isolated within the Morrope district, and they do not have access to fresh products. \r\n\r\nSebastiana wants to expand her business, buying more chickens to sell not only in her community, but in nearby areas.

Her husband, who works erecting power lines for an electric utility, helps her on the farm.  Carmen also hires laborers during the planting and harvesting season to speed up the work.  What she most likes about the business is planting and harvesting peas because the return on the crop in the city's wholesale market comes to S\/.50 (50 new soles) a bag.

Munavar would like to continue this expansion with a new loan of $350, which she will use to buy new products to sell to her customers.\r\n\r\n <p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina H., Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0424\u0430\u0451\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u041c\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0432\u0430\u0440 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u043d\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0431\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438  \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u0417\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041c\u0443\u0436 \u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0440, \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0438 -

He is a very hard-worker, and works cultivating an orange grove, an activity which he has practiced for 30 years ever since he married.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She lives with her husband, four sons, and two grandchildren in Las Avispas, an impoverished but beautiful village outside of Puerta Plata. There is not nearly enough space for her whole family in her tiny home, which only has two beds. <P>\r\n\r\nMiledy tells me that although she is grateful for what she has, her health, a loving family, and her faith, she wishes she could help to provide a better life for her children and grandchildren. She wants to send Rican and Ronnie, who are 27 and 17 respectively, to university. She wants to expand her house so that her children don\u2019t have to argue over who gets to sleep in the beds.<P>\r\n\r\nWith these dreams in mind, Miledy came to Esperanza to take a micro-loan and create her business. Actually, she has started two. During the day, she sells used clothes along her street and in her neighborhood. She buys these clothes from Santiago, which is about 2-3 hours away. At night, she runs a food stand from which she sells hot-dogs and sandwiches. <P>\r\n\r\nMiledy has taken four loans from Esperanza since starting her business. Her first loan was for 6,000 RDP. Now her business has expanded to the point where she needs a 10,000 RDP loan to buy enough inventory for resale.<P>\r\n\r\nMiledy has big dreams for her clothing business. Ultimately, she hopes to purchase clothes internationally, where she could find cheaper prices than in the Dominican Republic. She then hopes to sell them in areas that are busier than her own neighborhood. Miledy\u2019s vision for a better life and a better business is coming true, but she needs access to micro-credit to make it happen. Thanks for taking the time to read her story and for considering her for a loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2250,"image":{"id":360869,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

S. is 39 years old.  He lives with his wife and two children in the community of Canalete, which is located in Upala in the province of Alajuela.  This region is a semi-mountainous area known for being a center of agriculture and livestock farming. It is a community that has great potential for development and establishment of microenterprises, in both agribusiness and trade.\r\n<p>\r\nFor four years, Don Eliecer has been raising chickens for fattening, as well as hens, for producing meat and eggs.  He sells his products to the residents of the community who are very satisfied.  He says having the support and help of his wife makes him continue with this endeavor. Don Eliecer also says that his work is very interesting because he has seen his business grow slowly and demand getting stronger.\r\n<p>\r\nAt the moment, Don Eliecer is requesting a microloan of 680,000 colones to buy more chickens and hens, concentrated feed, and medicines to help combat disease.  He also would like to enlarge and reinforce the structures that house his animals.  With these changes, he hopes to grow his business and improve his quality of life.  Although the business is doing well, the lack of capital has prevented any plans for expansion.  With the loan he requested, Don Eliecer expects to increase his sales and improve the financial condition of his family.  \r\n<p>\r\nDon Eliecer is a member of the Canalete Community Credit Enterprise, one of the 100 partner organizations affiliated with EDESA in Costa Rica. This is his first loan and he hopes to continue growing personally and economically. He is an active participant in his community\u2019s credit organization.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

The main source of income for the business comes  from planting and harvesting cassava for sale. Nena has been engaged in her business for over 12 years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nena joined GDMPC in order to gain access to financial services that could help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from GDMPC. Nena is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizers, such as manure. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Nena from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees and meet their daily needs.\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Pieza, Villaverde, Nueva Vizcaya. She is thirty-three years old. Cherry is the group leader of a five-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nCherry is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Cherry owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for her business comes primarily from raising and fattening pigs for sale. Cherry has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for this work.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Cherry joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to make her more capable of engaging in business activities. Cherry has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. The previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise for future sale. Cherry is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be her second loan from ASKI; she will use this loan to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has twenty-five branches covering the central and northeastern areas of the Philippines. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Marilyn has just started operating this business and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, Marilyn joined NWTF to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marilyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,500 PHP from NWTF. Marilyn is now requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. The loan will be the 17th loan taken out by the borrower from NWTF. Marilyn plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc., has answered the call of not just of a few but thousands of women.

Nelly belongs to a group of entrepreneurs where she saves her money and has secured access to capital from ASHI. She appreciates that the organization has helped her improve her businesses and therefore her quality of living.\r\n\r\nShe has requested a loan of 20,000 PHP to pay for maintenance of their tricycle with some of the loan funds to be used to purchase necessary supplies for her store. She hopes to buy more tricycles in future for better output and so that her children can make their own living. She sees herself venturing into \u201cTalyer\u201d which means auto repair and a vulcanizing shop business in the next five years. Nelly is hoping that her envisioned businesses will help her to support the financial needs of her family so that they can move away from the nightmares of poverty.
