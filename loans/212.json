He lives with his mother and one brother. After the death of his father, he took the responsibility of meeting the family expenses. As with the majority of the Lebanese men, his story illustrates the day-to-day challenges in working hard to support their families with their business income. He has been working as a car electrician for almost eight years. Today, he is requesting to borrow $1000 from the Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to purchase additional tools for his business. In the future, he hopes to continue expansion of his business. He expects the coming year to be successful and to further increase his business productivity.\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Micro-finance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Micro-finance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

M. is a mother of two sons and one daughter. Etaf's husband passed away, leaving her responsible for taking care of the family. Etaf's children are old enough now to work with her. She wanted to start a family business and have her sons working there.\n\nA year and a half ago, Etaf started a small poultry farm on the rooftop of her house. She raises chicken and prepares them for cooking to be sold to neighbors. Etaf's returns are good but she wants to enlarge the project and cover a larger area, so she came to FATEN and took a loan to purchase coops and feeding trays.\n\nEtaf hopes that one day she can rent a bigger place and have a proper farm, providing better opportunities for her children. Etaf's son appears in the picture here on the farm as Etaf is very religious and uncomfortable having her picture online.\n\nImportant information about this loan:\n \nFFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the culturA. context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principA. loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit our FAQs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":633702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To improve the farm by purchasing coops and feeding trays ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PS","country":"Palestine","town":"Jabalia-Gaza Strip","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.92157 35.203285","type":"point"}},"partner_id":80,"posted_date":"2010-11-07T16:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Etaf","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1120,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":97},{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.43},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.42},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.41},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.42},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.41},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.42},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.41},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.42},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.41},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.42},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.41},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":97.43,"local_amount":97,"processed_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:20:27Z","rounded_local_amount":97.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182604498},{"amount":93.42,"local_amount":93,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:22:18Z","rounded_local_amount":93.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188743689},{"amount":93.41,"local_amount":93,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:02:30Z","rounded_local_amount":93.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191481779},{"amount":93.42,"local_amount":93,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:14:28Z","rounded_local_amount":93.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195908441},{"amount":93.41,"local_amount":93,"processed_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-19T08:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":93.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201831350},{"amount":91.39,"local_amount":90.98,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-17T08:05:43Z","rounded_local_amount":91.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206450181},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":93.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":93.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211292601},{"amount":188.52,"local_amount":187.69,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T08:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":188.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221888056},{"amount":92.71,"local_amount":92.3,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:14:41Z","rounded_local_amount":92.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227112402},{"amount":93.75,"local_amount":93.33,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":93.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232873863},{"amount":93.79,"local_amount":93.37,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:15:42Z","rounded_local_amount":93.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238690120}],"funded_date":"2010-11-07T22:50:29Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T11:15:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Liz Nagle","image":784126}},{"id":249256,"name":"Tamaneh Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In the photo are members of the \u201cTamaneh\u201d group.

In the meantime, she enjoys doing business.\r\n\r\nMargo is excited to be taking her third loan with Esperanza. She runs a clothing sales business. She has had her business for nearly two years. She began her business by selling a dozen pairs of jean pants she bought with her first loan. \r\n\r\nMargo is planning to use this loan to invest in her business by buying clothing in different sizes for men and women. Christmas is a good season to do good sales. That is why she and her group are requesting this loan. She will reinvest the profits in her business by purchasing more products and expanding her business with more options and new clients. She dreams of becoming someone with a very important business.\r\n\r\nMargo represents her group and many Haitians who emigrated to the Dominican Republic to improve their lives.

Ana\". Most of the women live in Santa Ana, a very small village on the outskirts of Antigua Guatemala. All of their businesses have been verified by business advisors, who believe that each woman stands to benefit from the support offered by Fundacion Namaste Guatemaya.  In addition to a loan, Namaste provides coaching from business advisors who develop a detailed understanding of the borrowers business (see below an example of how much detail they have on their clients).  \n\nEach of the women in this group are hard-working entrepreneurial ladies that dream of growing and bettering their businesses. Most of them are involved in the production and selling of food. For example, one of them promotes her business on Facebook and provides updates on the new products she will sell in the near future. There is also a woman who sells corn meal (the only one in the area) and another who sells products by catalog. \n\nCarmen Lucrecia (2nd from left to right) is a 48 year-old single mom who went to school through 9th grade. She has two daughters, one that is already married who contributes Q400 ($53)  per month to the household income and a younger daughter that still lives with her. Her younger daughter also has a daughter and Carmen Lucrecia pays for her school. Carmen Lucrecia has been selling food at the park of Santa Ana for the last 12 years and has become famous for her garlic bread, a product she introduced long ago to differentiate herself from the competition. She calls her big delicious bread \u201cNeco\u201d and this is the main attraction for her customers. She will share this business with her daughters so they have a place to work and support their families as well. \n\nHer dream is to learn how to manage her income, separate her profit from her personal expenses and be able to save enough money to open a new place to sell food in the village of Jocotenango. Currently she has a profit of Q986 (US$130) and works 240 hours (US$0.54\/hour) per month. Her plan for the next 9 months is to increase her profit to Q1,665 (US$220). She knows that with the support of Namaste she will learn how to calculate and better manage her profit so she can open an additional location to sell her food."}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1373432,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to save money to open a new location","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santa Ana, Antigua Guatemala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.5 -90.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":292,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes Amparo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Lucrecia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miriam Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvia Leticia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":10500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":2588,"name":"Akp\u00e9n\u00e9","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Born into a poor family, Mrs. Akp\u00e9n\u00e9 D. is a dynamic woman struggling to pull herself out of poverty.

She finally decided to engage in the buying and selling of wooden objects made locally by metal-workers, such as mortars, stools, grain huskers, stirrers, etc. She has been doing this for 5 years now. A mortar is a receptacle made of wood used by women (indispensable for rural folk) to husk, break, and grind cereals, condiments, etc. <P>\r\n\r\nEnjoying great popularity, she is much sought after, especially around the beginning of the off-season when women do a lot of buying as they set up trousseaus for their daughters (since in Bambara culture in general and that of Malians in particular a woman without a mortar is like a farmer without a plow) de leurs filles (car dans la mentalit\u00e9 bambara en g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et celle des maliens en particulier une femme qui n\u2019a pas de mortier dans son trousseau de mariage est comme un cultivateur sans charrue). Besides her principal business, she also sells charcoal and honey.<P>\r\n\r\nSo as to build up her inventory to avoid running out of something, she came to the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso with whom she has been working for 3 years. After three group loans (solidarity loans) and one individual loan, all correctly reimbursed, she is on her second individual loan which she will use to buy 15 mortars, 7 sacks of charcoal, and 20 liters of honey. <P>\r\n\r\n Mrs. Assitan Sidib\u00e9 does her buying in Tissala, one of the neighboring villages of the town of S\u00e9gou from blacksmiths specialized in working with wood (for the mortars), rural folk who keep bees for her honey, and those who have an authorisation to cut wood as far as the charcoal is concerned. She sells for cash or on credit to a clientele composed of women and men. \r\n\r\nShe expects to make a monthly profit of 75,000 F CFA which will be used to make repayments on the loan and for her own

With her first loan, she ventured into the retail selling of charcoal. She had observed the demand for charcoal in the market and knew that selling charcoal would bring them enough profit for their day-to-day living. Now on her second loan, she is requesting 10,000 pesos as additional capital for her business. The loan will be used to pay for 101 sacks of charcoal and a brand new weighing scale. Josephine is hopeful that, with the financial access that she has from ASHI, she can improve her business and make it grow.\r\n<p>\r\nJosephine came from a poor family. During her childhood, she dreamed of finishing her studies, but due to financial shortages she was not able to make it. Now, her dream for her own children is to send them to school until they finish college and find jobs, so that they will not suffer the life that she had.

She is a very hardworking woman and because of her hard work, she is so loved by her husband and the children. She prepares and serves porridge in the community where she lives. Her porridge is enjoyed by many as breakfast and supper.

He lives in a house in Anticr\u00e9tico.  His greatest desire is to buy his home, so that he can get out of antichresis (possession and enjoyment of mortgaged property by mortgagee in lieu of interest payments) because it is inconvenient for him to not be able to make changes to his house because it is not his property.  He does have some capital to use towards his home, capital which he is currently using to pay off the antichresis, but he needs six thousand American dollars ($6,000).  His wife sells food out of their house to help support their nuclear family.  They have two dependent children.  Don Edmundo started to work when he was very young, and he has been working in this field for 15 years, with his own car for one and half years.  Now, his work in his own car is easier because they don't have to pay daily rent to anyone; he can just work for himself and his family.  His dream of his own house is not far off, because he now earns more money with his own vehicle, which he can use to pay off his mortgage.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Julia Kastner,

Her other 5 children are independent and live with their own families.\r\n\r\nThree years ago she set up a small and well-stocked food store in her home.  At first she feared she would not have good earnings, but her desire to help her husband with the household expenses led her to start the business.  She later realized that the store would give her good earnings and so she expanded the store site.  Betzabe likes her work very much because it is quiet.  At times one of her daughters helps her, especially when she has to go out, because she does not like to close the store and lose the income.  Although at her age the majority of people think  of resting after a lifetime of work, she is thinking about improving the facilities of her store and offering a greater variety of products.\r\n\r\nThis is her 4th loan with MFP, and she is very grateful to all of the people who have made her loans possible so that she can continue doing the work that she enjoys.  Also, she is very pleased to work with her group, since everyone is very punctual with their payments.  Betzabe will invest the money that she requests in the purchase of a greater quantity of merchandise to restock her store and offer a greater  variety of products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":494491,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-23T21:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Betzabe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":76.46},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":78.65},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":81.94},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":84.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":87.61},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":90.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.58},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.46},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.93},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.05},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":30.58,"local_amount":76.46,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":87.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993296},{"amount":31.46,"local_amount":78.65,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":89.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718079},{"amount":32.78,"local_amount":81.94,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:12Z","rounded_local_amount":93.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751754},{"amount":33.93,"local_amount":84.83,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":96.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934216},{"amount":35.05,"local_amount":87.61,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:15Z","rounded_local_amount":99.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672991},{"amount":36.2,"local_amount":90.51,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":103.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886785}],"funded_date":"2010-02-24T15:19:07Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":183710,"name":"Riham","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Riham is a single woman, 23 years old.

Kiva borrower is a 33-year-old married man from Lebanon.

During this long period, he has gained good experience and a good reputation in this field. He is requesting a loan of $1200 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l. to increase his capital to improve and expand his business. In the future, he is looking to diversify his business and open a new shop where he can buy and sell spare car parts\r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e., blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.) Ameen s.a.l. appreciates Kiva lenders' understanding of these challenges and encourages lenders to continue their support for Lebanon's borrowers.\r\n\r\nAbout Ameen:\r\nAmeen s.a.l. has been a major player in the Lebanese Microfinance sector since 1999. Originally, a micro-credit program created by CHF International, Ameen evolved to become Ameen s.a.l. in 2003, a Lebanese services company. In 2007, Ameen s.a.l. registered with the Central Bank of Lebanon to become the first Lebanese financial institution specialized in Microfinance.\r\n\r\nAt Ameen s.a.l. we pledge to provide financial services to the largest number of micro and small entrepreneurs and to the working poor, to help them develop their businesses and improve their incomes.\r\n\r\nAmeen has been able to use its interest-free loans from Kiva to offer lower-interest loans with faster disbursement for their micro-loan borrowers. Since its inception, Ameen has provided high-quality financial services to over 41,000 borrowers and disbursed over 81,000 loans totaling $115 million.

Chunaidullo is a 50-year-old married man with six children. His family plans include moving forward with crop production so that he can financially support his children\u2019s studies. The biggest problem Chunaidullo faces is that pests have affected his crops, and he does not have enough money to deal with the problem. He has been working in agriculture for five years. He is requesting this loan in order to use it for his crops, thus thwarting losses. Agriculture is his family\u2019s source of income. For this reason, Chunaidullo gives thanks to IMON and Kiva for the support it gives him via this loan, which will be of great benefit for his crops.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Le entretiene mucho su labor ya que tiene clientes fijos con las que conversa, mientras negocia, adem\u00e1s su capacidad para convencer le ha permitido  recibir grandes incentivos de la compa\u00f1\u00eda por el volumen de su  ventas. Por esta raz\u00f3n esta satisfecha, pues mientras trabaja y gana dinero no descuida las labores de su hogar, adem\u00e1s ayuda a su esposo en los gastos, pero lo que le disgusta es que a veces sus clientes se demoran en pagar en la fecha indicada y eso genera un atraso de su capital. Como Sonia es una mujer emprendedora para el futuro tiene planeado aumentar su mercader\u00eda y tambi\u00e9n quiere instalar una librer\u00eda en su casa. Es el primer cr\u00e9dito que tiene con MFP y promete pagar sus cuotas puntualmente, pues no quiere quedar mal con las personas que hicieron posible este pr\u00e9stamo que les permitir\u00e1 continuar en su negocio. Sonia tiene planeado invertir el cr\u00e9dito solicitado en la compra de cantidad de productos de belleza, pues necesita cumplir con la demanda de sus clientes, asimismo espera mejorar sus ganancias.\n\n","en":"Sonia is 43 years old, married to Walter, a 44 year old tailor.  They have 4 children, 2 of which are older and already work and help with the household expenses. Together they live in their own house. When their children began to grow, Sonia had more time and decided to start a business; it has been 3 years that she has earned her living selling different brands of beauty products through a catalog. She enjoys her work very much, speaking and doing business with her steady customers; it has given her the ability to receive big incentives from the company for her volume of sales.  For this reason she is satisfied because as she works and earns money, she does not neglect her household chores, and helps her husband with expenses.  What she dislikes is that sometimes customers delay paying on the specified date and that generates a delay with capital. Sonia is an entrepreneurial woman; for the future she plans to increase her merchandise and also wants to install a bookstore in her home. It is her first credit MFP and promises to pay the assessed fees on time because she does not want to look bad with the people who made this loan possible and allow them to continue their business. Sonia has plans to invest the requested loan in the purchase of beauty products because she needs to meet the demand of her customers and hope to improve her profits.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":642715,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To stock up on beauty supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-19T02:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:39Z","rounded_local_amount":175.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725363},{"amount":62.62,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:09Z","rounded_local_amount":175.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463461},{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:05Z","rounded_local_amount":175.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886843},{"amount":131.45,"local_amount":350.52,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:05Z","rounded_local_amount":369.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327196},{"amount":55.67,"local_amount":148.48,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:40:59Z","rounded_local_amount":156.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269446}],"funded_date":"2010-12-01T05:02:54Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:40:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Reynolds","image":635173}},{"id":253368,"name":"Khalil","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khalil is a 32-year-old married man who has been working as a house painter since 1995.

She is a single parent with three children currently studying in elementary school.  She keeps herself busy attending to her kids and business. She wants to provide a comfortable life for her family. \r\n\r\nFelicisima maintains a direct selling business. She sells herbal supplements. Her customers' orders are bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer on a cash basis. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are counting on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community who prefer taking herbal medicines to cure their ailments.  She earns a minimum of Php550 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 31,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy herbal supplement orders for her customers. The herbal supplements that she carries produce good results for her clients and they recommend them to friends who they believe need them, too. To date, she has received plenty of orders and she needs additional capital. \r\n\r\nFelicisima dreams of being able to give all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She aspires to attain a good position in her direct selling business and to be able to have a kiosk someday where she can display her herbal supplement items.  She faithfully attends the weekly fellowship* that allows her to share her own story of God\u2019s love and provision in her life. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":931497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Natural Medicines","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To pay for herbal supplement products needed in her business.

They all are involved in buying\/selling businesses or production\/selling. They have demonstrated in the early educational sessions that they are motivated and very interested in learning how to keep control of their expenses and sales. \n\nThey also mentioned that nobody has even been interested in teaching them how to work and improve their business thus they are eager to have the Business Advisor monthly visit to improve their businesses. \n\nLilian is 40 years old, a widow and is raising two kids under 15 years old who are going to school (in the picture, you can see her 4th from left). She does not how to read and write and is living far away from her family. While she was living with her husband and raising their family, he suddenly fell ill and ultimately passed from an unknown illness.  They exhausted their savings on medical bills and were forced to sell all of their appliances to pay doctors and hospital bills. Widowed and broke with two kids to raise, Lilian moved to a place where she pays no rent and gets electricity from the owner. She started selling \u201ctortillas\u201d door to door and now she has a place to make them and sell them too. Until now, she has been producing the tortillas for lunch and dinner. \n\nHer dream is to be able to have enough money to buy wood and corn by bulk because it is cheaper and now with the rainy season, dry wood is very difficult to find. With these supplies, she will be able to start producing tortillas for breakfast to meet her clients requests. She wants to learn how to manage her money and separate and save it in a way that she can start purchasing all of the appliances she was forced to sell when her husband got sick. \n\nHer actual monthly profit is Q1,740 (US$228) and she works 170 hours per month (US$1.35 profit per hour). Her business plan is to increase her profit by 40% by adding an additional selling time and by purchasing dry wood and corn in bulk.

Kossi Anani was born in Kpop\u00e9-Tansi in 1977 in the district of Zio. He is married and father of three, and works as a secondary school teacher. His salary is insufficient and irregular and he fails to meet all family needs; therefore he decided to launch a second career. Brave, courageous and hardworking, he decided to go in for market gardening to improve his revenue. Thus very early in the morning he works in his garden before going to the school and does the same the evening after school. His wife provides him with significant support in this activity that is growing larger and larger. Honest and good manager, he was able to reimburse very easily, the loans that he received earlier. Today, Mr. L. wants to expand his market gardening activity and make it an important source of revenue for his family.

She is 29 years old and lives with her husband, 30-year-old Carlos, and their young daughter, two-year-old Marilyn, who is her motivation. Claudia's business is graphic printing. Her shop is located in the center of the city, so it is very busy with customers. She works by order, and among her most popular orders are calendars, reminders for family events, flyers, posters, etc. She has now been doing this work for five years, and what she likes best is designing the work and then seeing them printed. The hardest part is having to stand the strong odors of the chemicals she uses to print, but she knows that she must do a good job, and this is the work she chose. In the future, she would like to have a much larger printing office, and thus be able to provide a better life for her family. This is Claudia's first loan with MFP. She is very confident that she will be able to make her payments on time. She is a very happy and participative member in her communal bank. With this loan of 1,000 soles, she will buy new materials to improve the quality of her printing.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Trisha Bury, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":329781,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Printing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase materials for printing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-06T22:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:54Z","rounded_local_amount":173.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990698},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":173.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211800},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:40Z","rounded_local_amount":173.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641325},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":173.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080764},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:11Z","rounded_local_amount":173.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996904},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:07Z","rounded_local_amount":171.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842244}],"funded_date":"2009-06-07T01:31:22Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Trisha Bury","image":804995}},{"id":117316,"name":"Mavdjuda","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"    MLF \u201cMicroInvest\u201d is one of the leading microfinance organizations, rendering credit services to the population of Tajikistan.

Elsa is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell, and she plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.<p>\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

When her husband died, she had to struggle alone to support her two children.  Since then, she has worked at various jobs and, thanks to her hard work, managed to set up a small general store, a business that she operates in her house.  She sells a variety of perishable products such as meat and vegetables.  Separately, she used some savings to buy a motocab that she has rented out and that her oldest son uses for a taxi business.  The motocab has been used so much that it is now in need of repairs.  It's for that purpose that Delia is applying for a loan.  She wants a mechanic to repair the motocab so that she can continue to use it.  She says that renting the motocab has been a difficult business because renters don't take good care of it.

that even though the sweets business in Cartagena is quite competitive the quality that\u2019s reflected in the sanitation standards and the purity of her ingredients make her firm a sustainable micro business.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she needs it to buy a larger amount of ingredients that she uses to elaborate the product, like milk and sugar, because she knows that as a young woman, if she persists in meeting her goals, in the end she will secure a future in which her sweets are savored in many parts of the world.\r\n<br

She is married to Julito D.. They have children, but their children all have families of their own and their own houses, so Rosario and Julito live alone like newlyweds these days. <p>\r\n\r\nEven at her age, she explains that she is still strong and very motivated to succeed with her business. She really enjoys generating money from her business. The profits she realizes from her business help to sustain her and Julito by providing for their basic needs, which normally leaves some income that they give to their grandchildren as an allowance. She fundamentally believes in not just helping her relatives but also her community. Indeed, she believes that, if she helps others, God will provide her twice as much in return -- maybe not in the form of money, but possibly with good health. <p>\r\n\r\nShe would now like to expand her store by purchasing additional inventory so that her store can be a convenient location for her neighbors' shopping needs. To realize this plan, she is seeking to borrow 20,000 PHP ($475). Her dream is to be able to support her children by sending her grandchildren to school, though she would also like to have some savings for her and her husband's future

She lives with her partner and their three children, ages 12 to 18, in the Southeast of the city. Claudia was born in Barranquilla and she learned all she needed to become who she is today from her mother's good example. Upon completion of high shcool she started a family and worked for a company for more than 15 years. She finally started her own business when she received her inheritance from her mother: her shop. \r\n\r\nHer dream is for her children to be successful, and that they can fulfill their dreams. Her eldest son hopes to be a member of the National Police. One of her big challenges is time management because her business requires attention throughout the day, and in the evenings she helps her children with their homework and does housework too.

She is a widow and is solely responsible for her three children, one in college and two in high school. She manages her household while operating her business. She works hard to meet their daily needs and expenses\r\n\r\nDigna owns a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines, and while waiting for local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like copper, plastic, paper, etc. They sell these to junk shops like Digna\u2019s for a little profit. A junk shop then stacks, cleans, and gathers huge quantities of these materials to sell them back to factories or to a bigger junk shop.  She earns a minimum of PHP 1000 in her daily sales.\r\n\r\nDigna is requesting a loan of PHP 17,000 that will help to continue her business well.  She will use the loan to buy more recyclable materials from scavengers. Her profits from business will definitely help her to sustain her daily needs and her children's educational expenses.  \r\n\r\nDigna dreams that her junk shop will last and continue to grow. She wants her children to finish their studies and be able to have a comfortable life someday.

With this third loan she plans to achieve a monthly income of 115,000 West African Francs, which will be used to bolster her business capital, contribute to the family budget and pay off the interest on her loan. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ekaterina Sukhanova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":579829,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchasing fruits","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"A\u00efssata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2010-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":18750},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":18750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.63},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":40515.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180829},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:15:05Z","rounded_local_amount":20257.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476800},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":20257.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613509},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:25Z","rounded_local_amount":20257.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751941},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:20Z","rounded_local_amount":20257.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606193},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:29Z","rounded_local_amount":20257.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917866},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":18750,"processed_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:06Z","rounded_local_amount":20257.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360795}],"funded_date":"2010-09-01T09:41:35Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:13:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":224708,"name":"Tilekberdi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tilekberdi U. is 36 years old and lives with his wife and three children in Bayan-Ulgiy province in western Mongolia.

She is married and her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. In addition, he works as a driver for the taxi the family owns. Manar wants to change the taxi engine motor to let it work more efficiently and increase the family income. She also wants to purchase some home appliances she needs such as a refrigerator, gas, etc, but the amount of money she has isn't enough to pay for these expenses so she needs to take a loan of $2,386.67 from FATEN. When Manar takes the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to change the taxi engine motor to a new one, which enables her husband to work extra hours and increase the family income. Manar will also purchase the home appliances she needs and that will improve her life and she will be able to live with her family in better conditions. Manar is a conservative woman so her husband is photographed instead next to the taxi the family owns.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

Let\u2019s help her continue fighting to keep her family together and to accomplish her goal. <p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. <p><\/b>Para Do\u00f1a Teresa las cosas hasta hace un tiempo fueron duras y de constante sufrimiento, la persona que se convertir\u00eda en su esposo y con el que deseaba formar un hogar  estable y lleno de amor, siempre la maltrat\u00f3 f\u00edsica y psicol\u00f3gicamente en presencia de sus hijos durante mucho tiempo. \r\n\r\nCuando ella decidi\u00f3 terminar con estos actos busc\u00f3 ayuda y se march\u00f3 para establecerse en otra ciudad muy lejos de su natal Pucallpa; poco a poco y con mucho esfuerzo los hijos de Teresa fueron recobrando la calma y felicidad que hace mucho tiempo les arrebat\u00f3 el hombre que les dio la vida.\r\n\r\nEl incansable esp\u00edritu luchador la hizo emprender un peque\u00f1o negocio en el interior de la vivienda que habitaba; y jam\u00e1s se imagin\u00f3 que con el tiempo se convertir\u00eda en una de las m\u00e1s concurridas por el incomparable servicio que les ofrece.\r\nY como la poblaci\u00f3n se va imcrementando cada vez m\u00e1s porque se establecen m\u00e1s familias en las zonas aleda\u00f1as mayor es la demanda por los art\u00edculos de primera necesidad que ofrece en su peque\u00f1a tienda Teresa.\r\n\r\nCon el deseo de incrementar la cantidad de productos que ofrece hasta la fecha ella solicita un pr\u00e9stamo de 275 d\u00f3lares con el compromiso de retornarlos en un per\u00edodo de 6 meses.\r\n\r\nHagamos que ese esp\u00edritu siga luchando por mantener a su familia unida con el cumplimiento de su anhelo."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":68044,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy a more varied stock for her small general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-09-26T06:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jes\u00fas Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-10T06:37:58Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2007-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2007-11-10T10:21:42Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":79526},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2007-12-10T10:24:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":94803},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-01-10T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":113333},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-02-10T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":132821},{"amount":46,"local_amount":46,"processed_date":"2008-03-10T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":154858},{"amount":45,"local_amount":45,"processed_date":"2008-04-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-10T09:26:34Z","rounded_local_amount":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":179104}],"funded_date":"2007-09-26T06:37:58Z","paid_date":"2008-04-10T09:14:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":23117,"name":"Identity","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The entrepreneur is 40 years old.

L\u00f3pez is 65 years old, single, and has seven children (whom are not dependent upon her). One of her dreams is to keep her business going, since it helps to provide opportunity for her children and fulfill their needs.  She plans to improve her home since she does not have adequate space for cooking - the space she uses is actually a wood-burning oven. She is working hard and saving money up to fulfill her plans since construction materials are expensive.  \r\n\r\nShe's had her tortilla-selling business, located in the Subtiava Barrio, for 20 years, which she started with one bag of corn and a price of 25 cents for tortillas. She raised the price as times became difficult but she was still able to grow her client base and that's how her business grew to its current size. This loan is for capital which she needs to buy firewood and corn, among other things. She is grateful to work with the Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 and the partner organizations as they are very supportive in helping their clients succeed.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pamela Carre\u00f3n, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":242155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Business capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2008-12-20T19:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eugenia Celina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.86},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.86,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":848.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14858679},{"amount":42.86,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":848.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399934},{"amount":78.75,"local_amount":1470.09,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1559.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091920},{"amount":6.95,"local_amount":129.91,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:38:16Z","rounded_local_amount":137.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985317},{"amount":42.86,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:21Z","rounded_local_amount":848.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445928},{"amount":42.86,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:24Z","rounded_local_amount":848.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956575},{"amount":42.86,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:58:37Z","rounded_local_amount":848.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174003}],"funded_date":"2008-12-20T21:13:29Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T13:58:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Pamela Carreon","image":90574}},{"id":84580,"name":"Abdurafik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abdurafik is married with two kids.

Abdurafik is very enterprising, has vast experience working as a vendor, and is full of creative ideas. A reasonable pricing policy and client-friendly service have always been priorities in his work and have helped to ensure the success of his business. <P>\r\n\r\nAbdurafik has been running his business for many years. He was only 12 when he started to help his mother with her market business, then afterward when he became an adult, he started his own business. In general he has 12 years of experience selling clothing. Currently, Abdurafik is requesting a loan of 800 USD to increase his inventory. He promises to repay the loan within 11 months. He believes that having this additional turnover capital will help him minimize his sales risk and provide stable financial support for his family. Moreover, it will help him get closer to his ultimate goal of purchasing a big store of his own. <P>\r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been in business off and on since 1981. She started by selling rolled cotton. Her beginning capital was US$ 7. Her first business prospered but lasted only for six months due to the lack of goods on the market. \r\n\r\nMonique had to change businesses. She started selling rice and soaps at the market, but was severely impacted when the Congolese Franc lost its value in 1981. She lost all of her capital and went to take care of her family until 2003.\r\n\r\nMonique launched another business in 2003. She started selling beverages, cakes and waffles until 2007 when she joined one of Hope\u2019s groups called \u201cLoboko\u201d meaning \u201cHand\u201d in English. Through her sales, Monique makes about US$ 70 per week. Monique plans to use her loan from Hope to diversify her business and sell salted and smoked fish and mushrooms. In order to increase her income, Monique has various points of sale within her community. She dreams one day of putting up a large business building that she can rent out for additional income.  \r\n\r\nMonique is 64 years old, married, and a mother of twelve children between the ages of 22 and 46; two of her children are sick and stay with her. The rest of her children are independent. In spite of her age, Monique likes selling because it gives her the opportunity to make contact with many different people, and once they become permanent customers, she is able to offer them quality products at a better price and they keep coming back.

She really wants to get ahead in life, and this is why she works so hard.  Since she was very young she has concerned herself with finding ways to make money, which she learned from her parents.  Currently she sells alpaca wool in a market in the city of Juliaca.  Her wool is of a very high quality, so it sells very quickly.  It is very tiring for Reina to take all the wool to market, and this is the hardest part of her work.  But she knows that he has to do it to earn money, which she will eventually use to buy a car in order to transport the wool more easily.  She has been doing this for four years, and what she likes best is selling and chatting with her customers, who are always seeking her out.<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP, and she always made her payments on time, and says that this loan will be no exception.  She wants to eventually take out more loans which she will use to improve her business.  She knows very well that in her communal bank, they will support and guide her, because she is a well-loved member of the group.

She has one son, but he is married and makes his own living. She sells hammocks and has a small grocery store. She opened the grocery store in her home with money she was able to save up bit by bit. Gerarda used to help her mother when her mother made hammocks . That\u2019s why when Gerarda started her own household, this was the occupation that helped her to earn an income for her family. Since then, she has never slowed in her production of hammocks, and this small business helped her start another one. She has learned to fight and start over when there aren\u2019t any other options. Gerarda has now been presented with the opportunity to increase her sales even more, but she doesn\u2019t have all of the materials that she needs to make a large number of hammocks and the earnings from her grocery store also wouldn\u2019t be enough for the costs she would incur.

The members' expectations are to have a productive business that will give their families a higher quality of life and give their children a better education. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amy Schapiro, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"expired","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":390298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4525,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Nela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Valentina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yaqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jessenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Percy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carola  Giovana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eddy Janeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":31500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2462.98},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":2491.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2519.99},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2548.99},{"due_date":"2009-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2578.32},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2607.99},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2638},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":2668.35},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2699.06},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2730.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2761.53},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2793.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":353.81},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":357.88},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":366.16},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":374.64},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":378.95},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":383.31},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":387.72},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":392.19},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":396.69},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":401.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy Schapiro","image":null}},{"id":141994,"name":"Julia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julia es socia del Banco Comunal Morenita.\nJulia es casada, tiene 48 a\u00f1os y 4 hijos, Julia tiene una tienda en su casa en donde vende abarrotes y bebidas, actividad que realiza todos los d\u00edas con la ayuda de su hija.

After having run many businesses without success, she decided in the end to become introduced to buying and selling food items five years ago.\u00a0 She operates her business in front of her home in M\u00e9dine Sikasso, where she is much appreciated by her customers for the quality of her goods.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy her burgeoning customer base, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso two months ago.\u00a0 She is now on her first individual loan, which she intends to use to buy from suppliers:\u00a0 50 boxes of mineral water, 35 packets of NBB drinks, 30 cases of BRAMALI drinks, 20 boxes of canned drinks of various kinds, and other items.\u00a0 She purchases her goods locally and sells to customers composed of women and young people, cash or credit accepted, particularly during this period leading up to the holidays (Tabaski, Christmas, and New Year).\u00a0 \r\n\r\nShe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to augment her working capital, to help cover family expenses, and to pay the interest on her loan.\u00a0 The rest will be invested into her business.\u00a0 \r\n<br

located in the central valley of Costa Rica. \r\n\r\nMerida has completed a two year program in the art of beauty\/cosmetics. She has combined her educational background and her entrepreneurial instincts to open a beauty salon. Merida offers hair services such as styling, cutting, coloring and other hair related services, as well as nail services (manicures, pedicures etc.)  She plans to use this loan to invest in the purchase of various beauty products\/tools such as hair dryers, a hair straightener, scissors, creams, shampoos, nail polish, etc. Merida started her business five years ago with a loan she shared with a friend. This loan will be her first with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. \r\n\r\nOver the past year, Merida has been focused on raising her newborn son. As a result, she has been working half time at her salon. This loan will mark the return to full time work for Merida, as she aims to transform this loan into profits. Full time business hours are from 9:00AM to 6:00PM, Monday to Saturday, and Merida works alone.  The months of October, November and December are the busiest in the beauty industry. Merida can count on anywhere between 60 to 100 regular clients who make monthly visits during this time. Merida\u00b4s services are sought not only by members of her immediate community, but by clients in neighbourung communities who travel to visit her salon (San Jose, San Carlos, Guanacaste). These clients have helped to keep her business flourishing as there are a number of beauty salons in the area, creating high levels of competition for clients.\r\n\r\n In an effort to differentiate her salon from those of her competitors, Merida would like to invest in an automatic nail painter. This machine paints nails quickly and with intricate designs. The machine is quite expensive, so Merida will not be putting the current loan towards such a machine, possibly the next loan.\r\n\r\nIn general, Merida wakes up early, prepares breakfast for her husband and son, and carries out domestic tasks. From 9:00AMto 6:00PM she will be working in the salon, with an hour lunch break.

Since Claudio\u2019s move to the United States 20 years ago, he has worked on farms in upstate New York and found seasonal employment at different factories during the winter months. Fascinated by the variety of produce that is grown in the U.S., Claudio made a decision seven years ago to rent land and start a farm of his own farm \u2013 sustained with support from the Grow NYC New Farmer Development program.  \n\nWhen Hurricane Irene swept through upstate New York \u2013 devastating crops from Claudio's farm \u2013 it was his loyal Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) members that took immediate action to save his business. By collectively pooling their savings, Claudio\u2019s CSA was able offset lost income and monetary damages and kept Claudio\u2019s farm from going under. This demonstration of un-coerced, homegrown support is no less organic than the farm fresh vegetables Claudio has been selling for over seven years. With a variety of over 50 types of vegetables sold at six different markets throughout New York City, Claudio has amassed a dedicated following of patrons that can quickly discern the quality of Claudio\u2019s produce. \n\nIn 2011, Claudio searched for loan capital to help cover the cost of his next batch of seedlings for the spring, but like other immigrant entrepreneurs, a short credit history made it challenging for him to secure funding for his business. As a member of Grow NYC, Claudio attended a financing workshop on Dec. 1 and met ACCION USA Business Development Officer Erica Dorn, who saw potential in Claudio\u2019s business. \u201cI really saw some strengths in Claudio, particularly with his business momentum and strong CSA relationships,\u201d said Erica. Looking beyond Claudio\u2019s credit score, ACCION USA approved a microloan for seedlings, helping Claudio to stabilize his business during tough winter months.

Jennifer hails from west Nile part of Uganda. She is a student pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration at Makerere university business school. She came to Kampala around 2002 after finding that there was nothing possible for her in her home district.<p\/>\r\n<p>While in Kampala things could not come normally. The desire to study and the pressure from burdens due to improper income. She started some causal work to help raise money for fees, rent, feeding and all the requirements needed in life but all the same, it was easy. By good luck, Jennifer got a friend by the names Abalo Florence who introduced her to life in Africa that she joined as a member and find that at Life in Africa; there is a lot of creativeness. Members teach each other how to make crafts out of recycling materials and she too took the idea. She has learnt how to make bracelets, paper beads and other craft products.

from Mbeya, Tanzania! This is 25 year-old Neema M.. She is married with three children, aged 1, 3 and 6. In 2004 Neema established a charcoal business. Neema now requires a loan in order to purchase inventory in bulk. \r\n\r\nThese small, black and dirty pieces of dry earth are important not just to charcoal sellers but to their customers, who rely on charcoal to cook their meals. Many Tanzanians still use small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal) and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene in order to light them. The fire requires constant fanning to ignite and maintain the flame, and makes cooking quite a hot and laborious task. It may not be the easiest or most environmentally friendly form of cooking, but it is the only option many people can afford.\r\n\r\n \r\nAbout SELFINA\r\n\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing.

Maruja also sells vegetables. Maruja\u2019s dream is to buy a house, as she now rents her home. She\u2019d also like to send her children to school. At her community bank Maruja learned to save, to love herself, and to value herself as a person. Maruja applies what she was taught in the bank\u2019s trainings and games.

Maura thinks that the majority of women don\u2019t value themselves, and there has never been an institution in her community that only works with women.

With her savings, Isabel would like to buy a house, as she now rents her home. Isabel would also like to expand her business while her children are still small. Isabel has many dreams, for example, she hopes to be the perfect mother for her children, and she\u2019d like her children to be professionals. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nEl Bancomunal Santa Rosa esta formado por 11 clientas, esta ubicado en la comunidad de Cangallo, capital del distrito de Cangallo en el departamento de Ayacucho, esta comunidad  mayormente se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de frutales, pero es poco  la producci\u00f3n de cereales y la mayor\u00eda de la gente se dedica al negocio.\r\n<p>\r\nMaruja C., tiene un molino de  granos, se dedica  a  criar  cuyes  en casa  con  el desperdicio del  molino y  vende mor\u00f3n, ulpeada y 7  semillas.

","en":"Hayot is 46 years old, married, and has two children.  She received a secondary vocational education. Her husband drives a city trolley.  Hayot earns enough selling bread at the Panchshanbe market in downtown Khujand to feed and educate her children. She retails very high-quality, delicious bread, which is in high demand.  Each loan she has taken out has been used to increase her turnover. In the past she had only one sales outlet, but today she employs another saleswoman who works nearby.  She would like to spend the next loan on expanding her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Joyce ., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":301640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Bread retailer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-04-12T10:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hayot","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":160}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":160,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T22:09:50Z","rounded_local_amount":613.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36016145},{"amount":160,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:17:18Z","rounded_local_amount":613.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44599886},{"amount":160,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-30T07:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":613.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52994323},{"amount":160,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T11:07:46Z","rounded_local_amount":613.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215593},{"amount":160,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":613.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645087}],"funded_date":"2009-04-12T19:55:18Z","paid_date":"2009-10-10T10:31:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joyce .","image":null}},{"id":105076,"name":"Anor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"O. Anor is 44 years old and is married with five children. Anor is the sole breadwinner for his family and his only income comes from the cultivation and sale of large livestock at the local market. Every year, he buys young heifers from the farms in adjacent villages. He raises them with the help of his wife (pictured) and children and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers.\r\n<p>\r\nToday Anor is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd isn't enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase additional young cattle. To do this, he needs to invest an additional $650 in his business. In order to receive this amount, Anor has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner organization, IMON International.  \r\n<p><br>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

has worked as a butcher and a cook for 16 years. People often told him that his cooking was so good he should make a business out of it. Last year, James started his own catering business in a church kitchen. He makes and sells tamales and smoked meats, including ribs, links, lamb, duck, and goat. \r\n\r\nOne of James\u2019 main challenges is the high cost of cooking and catering equipment. He can only afford to purchase a little at a time. He is proud to have purchased his smoker, his biggest purchase so far, with his own savings. \r\n\r\nJames needs a loan to help him purchase a mobile food cart. He plans to sell his tamales and meats in California parks, so people will know where to find him and his products. In the future, James hopes to have his own kitchen so that he can expand his business to its full potential, including a staff of two employees. \r\n\r\nJames is excited about working wtih Opportunity Fund, not only for the chance of getting a loan to buy the cart, but also for teaching him important business skills to help him run and expand his business effectively. He feels good about his future and about finally taking the risk to become an entrepreneur."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":390288,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":1023,"youtubeId":"snNykYbAFPI","title":"Kiva
