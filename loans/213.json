In all, there are 23 members of the group, and the majority of them make a living farming.  This is the first loan that Jorge has taken out with Cooperativa San Jos\u00e9.\r\n\r\nJorge also makes a living farming: he grows cacao and passion fruit. He makes his purchases in Matilde Esther each month and also sells his produce there.  \r\n\r\nJorge will use the loan he is requesting to invest in cacao and passion fruit seeds.  He sees the loan as an opportunity to get ahead.  His dream is to have a field so that he can increase his production.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ahmad has spent several years in the agriculture business growing potatoes and wheat on his land. He also raises cattle. It is important to stress that he is a man whose responsibility is to provide for his family by giving them all that is necessary for their development.  He has a friendly family who are always trying to help each other. \r\n\r\nToday Ahmad needs a loan to obtain technological assistance for his crops. With part of the loan he will also purchase cattle to increase his number of animals. He awaits the approval of this loan confidently, knowing that it will be of enormous use to his business, and that his family will benefit greatly.  The loan will improve Ahmad\u2019s income and his family's living standards, for which he offers a sincere thank-you!    \r\n\r\nAhmad\u2019s wife appears in the photo.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history.  It was the site of a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\t\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after it gained its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History \r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Tohirboy has worked for many years in the difficult business of raising cattle. He is an exemplary husband in that he always tries his hardest to provide food for his wife and two children in their home. After purchasing his cattle, Iskandar provides them with all the right conditions for their growth: taking care of their food and protection and making sure they don\u2019t get lost. Once they\u2019re fully mature, Iskandar sells them in his area and also provides their milk for sale. \r\n\r\nCurrently he needs to purchase cattle to raise and for this reason is turning to IMON International to obtain a loan of $1,000. Iskandar thanks KIVA for the support that KIVA presents to small entrepreneurs.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need. \r\n\r\nTo learn more about IMON International's work, please visit:

In this way they make good profits.\r\n\r\nRodolfo enjoys his business a lot.  While his wife sells in the store, he travels the streets in his three-wheeled vehicle selling his fruit and, in this way, they make good profits which cover their children's education and well-being and the monthly rent for their business premises which is very expensive.  This enterprising man works hard with the conviction that in the future he will buy his own stall in the market itself or nearby.  For the moment, his priority is to stock his business with a range of fruits since they sell well in this summer season.\r\n\r\nThis is Rodolfo's first loan with MFP and he says that they trust him because he is very pleasant and responsible.

For the past 18 years she has run a retail shop where she sells basic essentials to the villagers. Her shop is like so many others of its kind selling maize flour, soap, bread, sugar, sodas, beer, etc. In the villages, it is quite common to see businesses that look exactly the same. In poor areas, you can not afford \u201cluxury\u201d items so everyone sells the basic essentials. It should be noted that few people lack for the basics and their needs are not forever growing like in the developed world. So far, they have not been marketed to the point that they begin to believe they are lacking in something. For the most part, the villages are quite pleasant, safe, with a strong sense of community.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in the neighbourhood of Parco loma near Santa Rosa which is located 45 minutes from the outskirts of Cuenca.\r\nShe is 31 years old and has been married for a few years. She has a good relationship with her husband who is a public transport driver. They currently live in the house of her relatives.

The advantages of her job are the rewards that she gains through the sale of her products. The disadvantages are late-paying clients and long hours spent walking, since she visits her customers house by house.  \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan and she gets along very well with the other members. Mar\u00eda Zha\u00f1ay encouraged her to become part of this great group of very happy and supportive women.

her own car for her convenience and to offer a better service to her customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Suzanne Grasso, Kiva

He lives in Kobenyang, Momo Division, in the northwest region of Cameroon. As a very hard-working guy. He has faced some major challenges in life, such as inadequate funds to pay for his children's education, ill health, and death of relatives. In 2008, he saw GHAPE as a source of relief and became a member. He has received and repaid loans from GHAPE twice and his previous repayments were encouraging.\r\n\r\nWith the loan he is requesting now, he plans to invest in his farm. With the profit from the loan, he will pay for his children's education, clothe them, and give them good food and good medication whenever they are sick.\r\n\t\r\nHe prefers to receive loan from GHAPE, rather than other financial institutions, because of the training GHAPE offers and because proper follow-up is done to ensure the loan is properly managed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach for People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum

With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosalie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her increase their family income to PHP 22,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th loan, she is requesting PHP 15,000 which she will use to purchase a new engine for their fishing boat so that her husband could continue with his fishing activities and Rosalie will have fish to sell. They are both working very hard to send all their children to school. Rosalie S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He lives in his own home along with his wife Maura, 56, and his youngest son Roberto, 30, who both help him plant and harvest his crops. His extensive fields of cocoa, coffee and coca leaves are the fruits of his arduous labor and firm conviction to move up in life. His products are in high demand in the city of San Francisco since his reputation of harvesting quality products helps him sell the items at very good prices. What he most enjoys about his work is guarding his crops from insects that could slow their development. He has been doing this activity for 40 years and considers the most difficult part to be transporting his products since they are very heavy and tire him out. In the future, he hopes to purchase new plots of land to expand his crops. This is his seventh loan with Kiva partner FP, and he knows that this support will be very beneficial to his work's progress. He is a very happy member of his community bank and he always keeps order at the meetings. With the 2,000 soles he is requesting, he plans to purchase fertilizer to apply to his crops so they are more productive."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":643809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizer for his crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-20T05:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Modesto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":168.63},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":176.97},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":181.24},{"due_date":"2011-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":189.62},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":196.32},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":203.24},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":210.42},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":217.03},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":225.51},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":231.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.13},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.15},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.7},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.74},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.16},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.68},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.27},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.68},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":61.13,"local_amount":168.63,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":171.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588878},{"amount":64.15,"local_amount":176.97,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:13Z","rounded_local_amount":180.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725378},{"amount":65.7,"local_amount":181.24,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:50Z","rounded_local_amount":184.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463475},{"amount":68.74,"local_amount":189.62,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:42Z","rounded_local_amount":193.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886858},{"amount":71.16,"local_amount":196.32,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:41Z","rounded_local_amount":199.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327211},{"amount":73.68,"local_amount":203.24,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:26Z","rounded_local_amount":206.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195764},{"amount":76.27,"local_amount":210.42,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":214.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269461},{"amount":78.68,"local_amount":217.03,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:37Z","rounded_local_amount":220.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549515},{"amount":81.75,"local_amount":225.51,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:08Z","rounded_local_amount":229.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718253},{"amount":83.74,"local_amount":231.02,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:21Z","rounded_local_amount":235.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349857}],"funded_date":"2010-11-20T09:56:37Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":253852,"name":"Mesaid","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mesaid S. is married and has three children, two of whom attend school.

training for medical professionals. Audrey has been working in the medical sector for over 30 years. She was originally a medic in the Army and then began training others in 1986. Her passion for teaching led her to open her own training center to ensure students receive top quality courses.  \r\n\r\nThe Visions CPR courses give medical professionals the skills to save lives. Audrey\u2019s loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana was used to replace old equipment, to pay three months\u2019 rent on the facility, and to put money aside to pay instructors. There are many companies that offer training in the industry, so Audrey has to make Visions CPR stand out. She does this by buying state of the art equipment and by hiring professional paramedics to teach classes. The professional paramedics give her clients \u201coff the books\u201d knowledge that they may not receive at other training centers.\r\n\r\nAudrey opened her business in 2006 and has been working to improve it since then. Her advice to people opening new businesses is to find the best ways to advertise because advertising can be difficult. She also wants to tell new entrepreneurs that starting a business is not easy. She says, \u201cYou have to have a desire to do what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Audrey has proven that being patient and diligent, despite setbacks, will help a business succeed. She looks forward to continuing to provide medical professionals with the courses they need.  \r\n\r\nFeel free to check out her website:

Oluoch.\r\n<p>\r\nThe above founding six members came together on issues and matters affecting their lives. \r\n<p>\r\nThey came together with an aim of assisting each other and also contributing money to pay for members' transport to attend clinical services at Chulaimbo Rural Provincial Health Centre. As time went by the group registered more members and now has 45 members. The members have also been trained by K-MET in Nutrition support, Home Based Care services, and IGAs management. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group is run by executives comprised of the Chairperson, Secretary, Assistant Secretary, Organizing Secretary, and the Treasurer. Members wishing to join the group are required to pay a fee which helps them run the day-to-day affairs of the group. A number of members have well-established income-generating activities such as poultry farming, dairy farming, cereal businesses, vegetable stalls, and community pharmacies. Since HIV\/Aids is a concern in this area and good nutrition has played a major role in HIV\/Aids management, the group through K-MET has applied for US $5000 to enable them purchase Nutriflour in bulk to sell to the locals around and beyond the community. \r\n<p><i>\r\nDisclaimer: Due to recent events in Kenya, the security situation in many communities remains unsettled, affecting many local businesses. Lenders to this entrepreneur should be aware that this loan may represent a higher default risk, and should be willing to accept this additional risk in making their loan.<\/i>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":162805,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy Nutriflour in bulk for sale to the community.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siaya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.06 34.286111","type":"point"}},"partner_id":24,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gabriel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clarice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lukas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angeline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milicent","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Joshua","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nereah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Linet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ruth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clarice","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilfrida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Philista","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grace","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rispa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dorine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carolyne","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenipher","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carren","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":null,"disbursal_currency":null,"disbursal_amount":325152.5,"repayment_interval":null,"repayment_term":null,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[],"scheduled_payments":[],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":44050,"name":"Mirela","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mirela was born in 1974 and she is single.

He is a very hard-working person who has always been a farmer who plants different varieties of agricultural products. For now he harvests vegetables; during this part of the year he leaves his home in the morning and goes to their remote fields to begin cleaning, watering and especially fertilizing which takes long hours of hard work.  For Armando this work is very difficult, but he does not lose the desire to do so because he likes the feeling of being in the company of his animals and work happily regardless of the threat of increased cost of fertilizers. This has sometimes hampered their planting since they did not have the money necessary to buy fertilizers.  He will invest the money in buying fertilizer to ensure that his harvest is good, and thus to improve the quality of their products, and transport them carefully to cities for their trade."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":190793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fertilizer for her agricultural land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-08-17T03:20:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Armando","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-31T16:01:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":116.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":117,"local_amount":334.29,"processed_date":"2008-09-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-01T07:25:56Z","rounded_local_amount":341.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":342797},{"amount":117,"local_amount":334.29,"processed_date":"2008-10-31T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":341.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":375049},{"amount":115.99,"local_amount":331.41,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:26:47Z","rounded_local_amount":338.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5335712},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":340.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9956890},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":340.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227142},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":333.35,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":340.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422384}],"funded_date":"2008-08-17T16:01:00Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T20:09:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":64538,"name":"Mwajuma's Tuache Uvivu Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwajuma is 40 years old.

He is thirty three years of age, married and a father with two children.  He comes from a clan called \u2018Asona\u2019 family.  \r\n\r\nThis family has a parrot for their symbol.  In the olden old days, they believed that the parrot was a wise bird who could communicate with them when something unfortunate was about to happen.  The bird would reveal the secret things to them. For that reason, anyone who belongs to this family is proud about that.  \r\n\r\nEmmanuel is a carpenter who has been manufacturing any form of room decor for twelve years now with lots of experience.  He says to give your specifications and it will be done.  Some of the things he does are beds, wardrobes, kitchen cabinets, etc.  Emmanuel says that, of late, it is becoming a bit difficult to fund his business due to inadequate supplies of wood for further processing. \r\n\r\nEmmanuel wants the loan to buy wood because that has been his major challenge.  He believes the loan will help him to meet the needs of his customers.

Shamsiya is 43 years old and married with two children of school age. She runs a caf\u00e9 where she provides meals of national and European cuisines. The caf\u00e9 is located in the central local market which allows her to have many clients, the majority of whom are those making purchases in the market. The business has been generating stable incomes during the last twelve years.\r\n\r\nNow, Shamsiya is planning to make wholesale purchases of foodstuffs like wheat, oil, potatoes, carrots, onions and oil. For this purpose she requests 4,000 Somoni. She had been provided with six loans by IMON International and has proved herself to be a reliable client. Today she thanks all supporting her and promises to repay the loan promptly.   \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Febe is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP, which will be used for the same purpose. This loan will be the 7th loan taken out by Febe from PMPC.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She lives with her husband and child in a traditional family in the Hamdallaye district of the town of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of the Republic of Mali). For social reasons she did not go to school and learnt at an early age from her mother, who sold condiments, how to manage an income generating activity. After several years' apprenticeship, she has for the past eight years been developing by herself the same kind of business as her mother, and she enjoys a large customer base and a certain notoriety. She is well known at the Castle market and the strength of her sales is due to the quality of her products. \r\n\r\nWith a view to increasing her business in order to meet customer demand, she has turned to the micro-finance institution, Soro Yiriwso, from which she has been granted her first loan. She is planning on using this loan to buy 20kg of pepper, 10kg of \"fi\u00e9fi\u00e9\" and 5kg of garlic, baskets of fresh tomatoes, packets of Maggi stock cubes and a bag of kitchen salt, from wholesalers in Bamako.\r\n\r\nMrs. Assitan Sidib\u00e9 sells on cash and for credit to a customer base made up of men and women. She is hoping to make a monthly profit of 75,000FCFA which will allow her to diversify her activities, by carrying out sheep fattening and making up wedding trousseaux for her daughter. Her ambition is to build a house to live in.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

When she receives the loan, she will be able to buy craft materials, and if the money stretches far enough she will use it to pay for her training sessions in craft-making, which are held in the country's capital.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":681237,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buy craft-making materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":203.64},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":212.8},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":222.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":232.39},{"due_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":242.85},{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":253.77},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":265.2},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":277.13},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":289.6},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":300.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.31},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.61},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.06},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.42},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.36},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.47},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.77},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":73.31,"local_amount":203.64,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:24Z","rounded_local_amount":205.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463726},{"amount":76.61,"local_amount":212.8,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:15Z","rounded_local_amount":214.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887109},{"amount":80.33,"local_amount":223.13,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":225.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327470},{"amount":83.88,"local_amount":233,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:35Z","rounded_local_amount":235.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196017},{"amount":86.93,"local_amount":241.49,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:29Z","rounded_local_amount":243.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269701},{"amount":91.82,"local_amount":255.05,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":257.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549707},{"amount":95.01,"local_amount":263.92,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:31Z","rounded_local_amount":266.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718401},{"amount":99.77,"local_amount":277.13,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":279.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349960},{"amount":104.96,"local_amount":291.56,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:46:59Z","rounded_local_amount":294.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850520},{"amount":107.38,"local_amount":298.28,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":301.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665766}],"funded_date":"2011-01-02T02:22:20Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":266157,"name":"Bernarda Guillermina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Bernarda tiene 35 a\u00f1os, inicio este medio de vida que es una pulper\u00eda.

He lives with his spouse and has a 7-year-old son.  They all live together in his own house.  He works hard to provide the best for his son and to improve his quality of life.  Alberto\u2019s work consists in selling groceries at retail.  He equipped a space in his house where he set up some shelving and a few other things to install his store.\r\n\r\nHis store is very well attended since he has everything at affordable prices.  He works alongside his spouse and is doing very well since he earns a good percentage profit on each sale he makes.  At the beginning when he started out he was a bit uninformed about his business but now he is stronger with more knowledge and experience that he\u2019s acquired on the job.  \r\n\r\nHe hopes to consolidate still more because his store is on a very busy street and people come by looking for items and sometimes he does not have them.  This is why he wants to make a larger investment to have everything available and capture more customers.\r\n\r\nThis will be MFP loan #2 and he is very happy because once again he will be trusted to be able to reach his objectives.

G. lives in the city of Tursun-zoda. She is 47 years old, married and has 3 children. She has finished high school. She is a seamstress by training. This is what she does now. Mahbuba works in an atelier where she sews traditional clothing. She has been doing this for 5 years. Now, that it is spring, there are more customers wanting to buy her products, this is why Mahbuba would like to increase volume of her goods. Mahbuba needs to buy cloth and ensure that her equipment functions well (fix her sewing machine). Therefore, she decided to ask for a loan amounting to $875, which will help her. Mahbuba plans to repay the loan within 8 months. <p><b>\r\n\u0413\u0443\u043b\u044f\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0445\u0431\u0443\u0431\u0430

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Gabriella's greatest wish is to build a small structure where she can operate her business.  \r\n\r\nAll the members are grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the confidence they have shown by extending these loans.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":539870,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3400,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gabriela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Solange","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kithi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shirley","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emiliana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mery ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":23589.74,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1620.28},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1839.39},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1869.44},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1899.97},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1931.01},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1962.54},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":1994.6},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2027.18},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2060.29},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2093.94},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2128.14},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2162.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":233.53},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":265.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":269.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":273.84},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":278.32},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":282.86},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":287.48},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":292.18},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":296.95},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":301.8},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":306.73},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":311.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":204710,"name":"In God We Trust Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joshua S., shown holding the sign, is the leader of a group of five borrowers called In God We Trust.

She has been farming for two years.  She inherited plots of land from her father.  She plants and harvests coffee on this land.  Even though she considers it to be good income, it is seasonal work.  The plants need time to finish growing until it is time to harvest them.\r\n\r\nShe also sells cosmetics door to door.  She generates more income this way.  \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, when it is harvest time she hires people to make the work go faster.  That way she is able to quickly sell her production at the main markets in neighboring cities.  That is why she gets good earnings.\r\n\r\nHer main objective now is to augment her agricultural business and to continue selling cosmetics.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP.  She is happy to know that she has financial support.  She is pleased to be part of her communal bank because all of the members are responsible and very supportive people.  She wishes to thank all of the people who will be lenders of the loan she is requesting.  It will be very useful in the progress of her business.  She will use the requested loan to buy fertilizers to improve her coffee crops.

He is married and the happy father of six children and grandfather to twenty grandchildren. For the last 40 years Huseynboy has reared animals and grown crops. He started this activity when he was 18 years old when his father used to help him. It was hard for Huseynboy to provide for his large family, since his mother and younger sisters lived with him in addition to his wife and children. He had to earn extra money at a construction site at weekends, and he would work night shifts as a taxi driver.\r\n\r\nIn time, Huseynboy got on his feet and now he has a stable income and a large plot of land where he grows fruits and vegetables. He also has three cows and ten sheep. Now Huseynboy lives with all of his family, and his elder sons and their families also live with him. His sons also help him around the house. Despite his age, Huseynboy feels young and full of energy.\r\n\r\nNow Huseynboy wants to buy and install vinyl windows and doors in his house, since the winters here are harsh and this year his grandchildren got very sick. A lot of money was spent on medicines. So Huseynboy decided to acquire vinyl windows which will protect him and his family from the cold and the heat. Unfortunately, Huseynboy does not have enough money at the moment to carry out his plan, so he has applied to MDO Arvand for financial support. Huseynboy has been a loyal client for three years already. He is grateful for the support during difficult times."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1882479,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy and install vinyl windows.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Asht","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.666667 70.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Huseynboy","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":7500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":549},{"due_date":"2015-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":551},{"due_date":"2015-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":579.64},{"due_date":"2015-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":583.66},{"due_date":"2015-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":597.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":615.76},{"due_date":"2015-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":630.13},{"due_date":"2016-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":642.19},{"due_date":"2016-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":657.67},{"due_date":"2016-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":676.79},{"due_date":"2016-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":689.85},{"due_date":"2016-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":726.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.84},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.74},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.38},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.64},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.52},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.82},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.75},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.23},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.29},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.38},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrew Wright","image":1866680}},{"id":988185,"name":"Nadeem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nadeem is 40 years old and lives in the area of Rawalpindi, Pakistan.
