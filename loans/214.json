B., 30, learned to sew on a manual sewing machine ten years ago, and managed to buy a treadle machine with help from her father. However, in recent years, she hasn't been able to afford material to make clothes with, so the machine was mouldering in the corner. With this loan through Friendship Bridge, Juana will buy materials to make the delicate blouses with hand embroidery that are beloved by local women. Material for each blouse costs about US$20 and she can sell the blouse for about US$26, for a $6 profit. Juana completed school to  the sixth grade level, and can read and write both Spanish and her mother tongue, Quich\u00e9. She wants to make sure that all her three children stay in school, but she also wants to make sure and teach them how to sew so they can join in the family business.  Her husband is also a weaver and they want to pass on that ancient tradition to the children as well, teaching them how to produce the beautiful local fabric which can be sewed into skirts, table covers, bed clothing, and shawls.\r\nWritten by Kiva Fellows: Nancy Lewis and Randy

with his wife and 7 children, of which the eldest is 18 years and the youngest is only one year old.\r\n\r\n<P>Alberto is a livestock breeder, and has been doing this for 25 years. Thanks to this activity, he can cover the expenses of his sizable family. For this reason, he goes out every morning to graze his little animals so they can eat. He guides them with much care, since he may lose them if he loses sight of them because the foxes are always on the lookout for anyone letting their guard down. He enjoys caring for his animals, being that thanks to this he can take a meal to his children, but the most difficult thing is killing them to take their meat to the markets of nearby cities.\r\n\r\n<P>Alberto\u2019s big family is his greatest love, and they are the biggest motivators in his life. The loan he is requesting will be invested in the purchase of young sheep, which will help to improve his livestock and help him become the best breeder in his area.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Evelyn Garcia, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":200773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase young sheep to improve the breed and quality of his livestock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-09-17T18:00:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-01T20:06:54Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":194.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5335926},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":194.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957104},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:59:28Z","rounded_local_amount":194.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227354},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:01:21Z","rounded_local_amount":194.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422589},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:30:53Z","rounded_local_amount":194.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27115812},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:39:52Z","rounded_local_amount":194.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36010778},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:53:42Z","rounded_local_amount":194.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594590},{"amount":65.66,"local_amount":187.5,"processed_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:36:51Z","rounded_local_amount":194.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989220}],"funded_date":"2008-09-17T20:06:54Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:36:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Evelyn Garcia","image":65880}},{"id":68306,"name":"Faaaliga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faaaliga S. is 49 years old and is married with seven children.

She sells food, natural fruit ice cream, and pork carnitas.  She started her business 7 years ago selling carnitas, but she had the opportunity to acquire a vending space at the San Juan Sacatepequez Market. At that point, she had the idea to enlarge her business by adding a diner she named \u201cLa Bendici\u00f3n\u201d (The Blessing).  \r\n<p>\r\nCarmen is requesting this loan because she wants to increase the sales of her diner.  She also sells clothing, but needs additional capital to acquire more inventory.  Carmen is a hardworking woman, having to spend the mornings and afternoons cooking at her diner and then afterwards make large batches of ice cream for delivery.  Her dreams include finishing the construction of her house and finding a good nursery school for her 2 year old child.  She strives to maintain her business since this helps improve her living conditions.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

In the photograph, he is standing on the left in the second row and wearing a blue pullover.  Jorge sells clothing and kitchen towels.  His loan will be invested in winter clothing such as undershirts, thermal underwear, long socks, and other items.  Jorge has been working with Fondo Esperanza for seven months and says it has been a great help.  He is a student, so this will help him pay for minor expenses as well as help his parents with their expenses.  Jorge will receive his degree in social work this month and intends to continue working with Fondo Esperanza.  His goal is to have more customers so that he can open a store in the central part of town.\r\n\r\nCuric\u00f3 is located in the region of Maule, which is in the central part of the country.  The climate in Curic\u00f3 is similar to that of the Mediterranean and considered one of the nicest in the country.  It is also known for its wine culture and the magical natural beauty of the surrounding areas.  Even though the workforce has increased, the region has remained steady in its population since the last census because it is one of the poorest in the country.  This area experienced damage from the recent earthquake in Chile, but the Communal Bank did not suffer from any serious effects.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She is 45 years old, married, and has two children, ages 17 and 14.  Both children go to school.  Maria only finished fifth grade and did not continue school because of financial difficulties.  She lives in her own house with her family and from time to time sends her mother some money to help with food costs.\r\n\r\nIn 1980, she and her husband left Xai-Xai to go to Boane for a work transfer.  Her husband currently works in the mines in South Africa and sometimes sends money to help with household expenses.  Maria is a businesswoman and has run her own business for more than 25 years.  She has no employees and earns about 4,500 meticais per month.  Maria uses the money for household expenses and saves some in her bank account.\r\n\r\nShe has taken out loans before from Tchuma Credit Union and decided not to continue with them.  She learned about Hluvuku through friends and relatives who are also customers of this institution.  This is Maria's third loan.  She is asking for 15,000 meticais to buy capulanas (a traditional Mozambican skirt), so she can increase her stock.  The earlier loans were both for 10,000 meticais and were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nMaria promises to pay off this loan on time so she can take out other loans.  Her dream is to have a nice shop to keep all her merchandise in.  In the future she would like to ask for more loans in order to expand her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

She earns her living by operating a motorcycle repair shop and a food production sales business. Her husband Nestor, who is 49 years old, works as a Bantay Dagat coast guard to earn his living. They have 10 children who are between 4 and 25 years old. Grace joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Grace has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000 uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy additional tools and equipment for her shop so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and expansion of her business. Grace is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is married and has 4 children. He has secondary education. He is a driver by training, but he primarily works in trade. Habibullo owns a grocery store which is located very close to his house. He has been in this business for the past 25 years. His store offers convenience and helps local residents to obtain groceries close to their home without needing to go to the center of the city. Currently, this business is the single source of income for Habibullo's family. For this reason, this loan will significantly help him by giving him the opportunity to increase the inventory. He plans to pay off the loan within 12 months.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Vasilisa Budnikova, Kiva

She is married, went to school until the 8th grade, and is the mother of an 11 year-old son who lives in South Africa with her oldest sister.  He is in school.\r\n\r\nZaida left Marracuene with her parents due to the war and went to Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland.  After her arrival she continued with her schooling, but she had to stop when she became pregnant, and her sister invited her to live with her in South Africa.  She began working in a beauty salon in Marracuene.  She married her husband, who lives in Mozambique, and moved with him but continued practicing her business.\r\n\r\nHer best orders are vases at 250MT, curtains at 450MT, blankets at 500MT, and sheets and pants at 350MT.  She resells for twice the cost each order.  She travels 2 times per month since her customers make payments in installments, and she earns 3,000MT monthly.  She is unable to save any money because she is living in a rental home and pays 800MT per month, she is constructing her own home, and besides her son she is also responsible for her niece who lives with her in her home.\r\n\r\nThis is Zaida's first loan with Hluvuku and with Kiva.  The 10,000MT will be used to increase the volume of her stock to satisfy the demand of her customers on time.  She is confident that she will pay off the loan before the stipulated time so she can request another loan to continue her work on her home because she cannot handle living in a rental house anymore.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva

Originally a mechanic in Guatemala, Eddy was finally able to return to his preferred profession in 2008 when he opened the automotive shop with two friends.\n\nIt has not been an easy process \u2013 not long after opening, the economic crisis hit and Eddy and his partners often had conflicting ideas about how to best run the business. As Eddy found himself handling most of the mechanic work and finances on his own, he decided to buy out his friends and run the shop on his own. \u201cIt was a challenge to grow the business on my own, and to make sure that everything got done and my workers got paid. But now the business is sustainable and it\u2019s growing!\u201d\n\nThanks to Eddy\u2019s solid skills as a mechanic and excellent rapport with his customers, his business growth has so far been sustained largely through referrals from existing clients. A $6,000 loan will allow Eddy to expand his inventory of auto parts to serve his clients better and faster, to invest in more marketing efforts to continue to grow business, and to hire a second full-time employee to help manage the growing workload.\n\nIn another year and a half Eddie would like to open another shop, and he says his dream is, \u201cto own an auto chain like Speedy!\u201d\n\nAlthough the recession has affected business, Eddy is optimistic about the future and is proud to be able to provide for his family. Of his children, he says, \u201cIf they want to be mechanics and work in the shop it is here for them, but for now it is important that they study.

The area is located one hour and 15 minutes from the city of Chiclayo. \r\n\r\nSince she was 24 years old she's devoted herself to raising and selling animals. She raised ranch birds, pigs, and cows in the backyard of her home. When the animals she raised reach a certain healthy point of development, she sells them to diverse merchants that visit the zone. The business is quite useful for the family's economics, as her earnings complement the income her husband makes as a farm worker, and they help sustain the family. \r\n\r\nMaria wants to enlarge her business by buying more pigs and birds. In addition she's planning to buy nutritious feed so that her livestock develop in healthy ways. This action will enable her to achieve greater profits and help her family move forward. For this reason, she's come to see the need to ask Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 1000 soles to help her reach her goal.\r\n\r\nMaria is a rather generous woman who always does her best to move her family forward. In the neighborhood where she lives she is highly regarded and her neighbors consider her a calm person who will help anyone who needs it.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jo Longnecker, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":530303,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy pigs, farm birds and nutritious feed to enlarge her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Caser\u00edo Arbolsol - M\u00f3rrope","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-04-27T01:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Teodora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":69.96},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":71.21},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":74.52},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":74.37},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":80.09},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":81.9},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":87.74},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":89.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":92.65},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":96.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":98.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.24},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.7},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.94},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.89},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.04},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.71},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.26},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.9},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.62},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.75},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.14},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":26.24,"local_amount":69.96,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":74.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695173},{"amount":26.7,"local_amount":71.21,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":75.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878217},{"amount":27.94,"local_amount":74.52,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:40Z","rounded_local_amount":79.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618245},{"amount":27.89,"local_amount":74.37,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:01:54Z","rounded_local_amount":79.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832644},{"amount":30.04,"local_amount":80.09,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:46Z","rounded_local_amount":85.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099252},{"amount":30.71,"local_amount":81.9,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:43:23Z","rounded_local_amount":87.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554664},{"amount":205.48,"local_amount":547.95,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":584.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182530086}],"funded_date":"2010-04-27T19:17:25Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T13:45:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jo Longnecker","image":606476}},{"id":200274,"name":"Soussi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soussi is a 53 year old married woman from Lebanon, who has three children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With the passing of time she invested more and more into her business, expanding it to include a bit of stationery as well, until it became one of the biggest and best stocked in the community. As well as selling groceries, Avelina also sells chicken in her house to her friends and neighbours, seven days a week. Avelina is a very happy, enthusiastic and hardworking woman. She tells us that she started her business because she wanted to help her husband with living expenses and give her children a better quality of life.

She sells general merchandise.  She began in this line of work when she was an abandoned mother, but, with much bravery, she decided to face her situation and invested some savings that she had.  In this way, she obtained customers who purchased with cash or credit.  At the beginning, it was somewhat difficult because her children were young and she did not have steady customers.  She had to walk long distances to win customers.  She never chose to leave her children.  She has always been a very responsible and caring mother.  Thanks to God, she has been able to face everything that has come to her.  She wants a loan to invest in her business; her most urgent inventory needs are for shoes, cosmetics, pants, children's clothes, and perfumes, among other things.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jeff Schell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":381338,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"business capital ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T21:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aura Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":853.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87036146},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:37:19Z","rounded_local_amount":853.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948553},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:32:24Z","rounded_local_amount":853.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790554},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:31:53Z","rounded_local_amount":853.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110681127},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:37Z","rounded_local_amount":853.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075658},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":853.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911676},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:48Z","rounded_local_amount":853.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947519},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:19:37Z","rounded_local_amount":853.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136675797},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":3333.36,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:24Z","rounded_local_amount":3415.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710181}],"funded_date":"2009-09-08T05:11:07Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Schell","image":null}},{"id":138023,"name":"Daisy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Daisy N. is 47 years old and a mother of nine children - of which, two are in high school, one is in grade school and the rest are grown.

It is located in Cuenca in the central south region of the country, enjoying a cold climate, appropriate for cultivation of vegetables, fruit and corn.  It is also characterized by its variety of typical food, such as roast pork, guinea pig, and other delicacies of the region.  On this occasion, we were accompanied by Deysi Ure\u00f1a, the bank's credit promoter.  In the photo she is wearing brown, has glasses, and is behind the member in red.\r\n   Mrs. Silvia lives in her husband's house in the Cristo del Consuelo (Christ of Consolation) sector with her 2 children who are still small (7 years old and 5 months since birth).  Her husband has resided abroad for 20 years and, now that he has his papers in order, he visits his family every 4 months.  She is 28 years old and is a professional driver, who has been driving a school transport van for 6 years.  She has 2 routes, one from 5:00 am until 8:00 am in which she brings young people to a school in the city, and the other from 12:00 am to 1:00 pm, with young people from a school in her locality.  These activities she combines with household responsibilities, caring for her children, and in her free time, she makes artistic nylon purses, which she learned how to do 10 years ago, thanks to her abilities and imagination.\r\n   She is in her 2nd loan cycle with the foundation, motivated by a friend and member of the little bank.  With this loan she will invest in her vehicle, buying some replacement parts and tires and, also, buy nylon to continue making purses.  Her goal is to buy a small auto to get away with her children on weekends.\r\n   Mar\u00eda Angeles is another member of the Las Morlaquitas bank.  She lives with 4 of her 6 children, since 2 are married and living independently.  Their ages are between 33 and 14.  Only her youngest son still studies at night school and mornings he helps her in the house.  All her children work and help to pay household expenses, since she is 51 and separated for 15 years from her husband.\r\n   Mar\u00eda has worked for 31 years in the market selling fruits and vegetables in her stall on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.  On other days, she does the same in another market, circulating in the P. selling everything between 6:00 am and 7:00 pm.  This activity has permitted her family to get ahead.  This is her first loan with the institution.  She was invited to join by her daughter-in-law.  With the funds she will buy citrus, melons, papayas, salt-wort, chicory, carrots, onions, tomatoes, and more fruits and vegetables to resupply her business.\r\n   Her dream is to have a house which she still lacks. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva

SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self esteem.  Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive updates on SPBD.\n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale up to 3--the higher the number, the better off the person.  The metrics are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":722819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives with his partner and they have four children. Together they live in the community of Villa Quintiarina, Kimbiri village district. \r\n\r\nFrom a young age Victor wanted to own land to farm, so as to be able to leave his job as laborer working in land owned by others. Thanks to the savings he accumulated over the years he was finally able to fulfill his dream, and he now owns 5 hectares where he grows cocoa and banana.

Twenty eight years ago he joined together with Bl\u00e1sida, now 45, with whom he has four children. Three of them are grown and the youngest still lives with them. Jose works slaughtering cattle, selling the meat in the butcher shop he runs in his home. At the same time he has a well-stocked store that he set up more than 25 years ago. His wife helps with the business. He says that he is from a humble family and with his father he previously worked making bricks. Thanks to their sacrifice he was able to put together a small capital to set up the store along with his wife. Thanks to this business he achieved economic stability and the possibility of moving forward with his entire family, and also being able to build his own home. Having access to credit, he would invest in the purchase of standing cattle to fatten up and later slaughter in order to sell the meat in his own butcher shop.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Raimkul is from the town of Istaravshan. He is 39 years old, married and has four children. Raimkul has always lived in the agricultural region of Istaravshan where he owns a small land and for the last 4 years he has worked as a farmer. He learned this skill from his father. \r\n\r\nOn his land he cultivates potato, wheat and other vegetables together with the help of his elder sons. At the same time Raimkul uses his car to provide a taxi service, and also raises cattle. His car requires thorough repairs, which has prompted Ramikul to seek a second loan request through IMON International. This will allow him to purchase spare parts for his car, and earn more money to send his children to university.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Every year, the education of Hermenia's children incurs bigger financial expenses. Hermenia's business had been very helpful in supporting those expenses and has abled her children to continue their studies.\r\n\r\nIt has been thirty years that Hermenia is into her business buying and selling fish.

Despite financial struggles, Hermenia proved her trustworthiness and well-defined values by showing good performance in terms of her repayments, attendance and business.\r\n\r\nRecently, Hermenia, her husband and her children decided to apply for a loan in ASHI to enhance her business further and it could profit greatly. The whole family agreed on the idea of buying more variety of fish and to increase the volume of their purchases in order to sell more, cover a wider area of the municipality, and have bigger profits. Aside from intending Hermania's loan for her primary business, they also plan to enhance their hog-fattening business (backyard pig-raising to be sold after four months) for an alternative income during the off-season of fish.\r\n\r\nThrough the profit Hermenia's hog fattening business would generate, she aspires to purchase a motor fishing boat to be managed by her husband while her profit from buying and selling fish will be intended for her weekly repayments to ASHI, family daily needs, and her children's

During her membership, she was noted of being one of the most active and with exemplary performance in ASHI.<\/p>\r\n<p>Her previous loans were invested in her computer shop business. Every time she receives a loan, she put them in the shop as additional capital. Now on her 11th loan, she proposes a loan of 30,000 pesos as additional capital for her computer shop. Specifically, the loan will be used to pay for 2 sets of brand new computer as additional units in her shop. She believes that her business will grow since the use of computer shops is in demand by students.<\/p>\r\n<p>Her dream in life is to expand her business and be able to purchase additional computers,

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have two young children who are 6 and 8 years old. Her highest aspiration for her family is that her children be able to go to school, earn their college degrees and have all the opportunities to attain a bright future for themselves and their families.\r\n\r\nThis is what motivated Christine and her husband Benny to engage in their fish-vending business, selling fish to regular customers in their community and even further to the neighboring barangays and sugar plantations. Delivering the fish to their customers was made easy with the aid of their tricycle - a motorcycle with a sidecar attached that can carry the fish containers. They were quite happy with their achievements at that point but then, in 2004, they knew they had the opportunity to expand their business if only they had the necessary capital.\r\n\r\nChristine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access the new capital she needed to expand the business. As she paid off each loan and borrowed a larger one that she could afford to pay back, Christine and her husband's business improved. Later, with the extra capital, she was able to put up a general store adjacent to her house to cash in on the income opportunity that it offered. The two businesses now earn an average monthly income of PHP 12,000.\r\n\r\nFor her previous, 11th, loan Christine borrowed PHP 29,500 that was used as additional capital for her business and this loan was fully paid on time without any delays in the weekly installments. For her 12th loan she proposed the same amount of PHP 29,500 to be used for her fish vending and general store businesses. The income from it will be used as savings for her two young children\u2019s future.\r\n\r\nIn the picture Christine is shown standing outside her store window while her two young children peek out from inside her general store.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":400812,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

These beads are used at marriages and burial and naming ceremonies. Nigerians love traditional beads because they are an important part of their cultural heritage. Patricia is married, has three children and is 45 years old. She has been in her line of work for a long time and has applied for a loan for 100,000 NGN to buy more traditional beads to sell.

She is 49 years old. Betty is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is A.'s Group.\r\n\r\nBetty is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Betty owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Betty has been engaged in her business for over 21 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Betty joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Betty has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Betty is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Betty from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the borrower's children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Rosalinda is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 9th loan taken out by Rosalinda from HSPFI.

For this they require a sum of money to be invested primarily in purchasing some products for their store and also for the handicraft activity of her husband, and thus they can travel to the Amazon jungle and bring back large quantities of raw materials and innovative items to be offered to tourists .<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Helen Smith, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":211070,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Increase the merchandise in their store in addition to paying for travel expenses of her husband to get materials to make his handicrafts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-15T13:53:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pamela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-29T23:08:10Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":216.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:37:52Z","rounded_local_amount":227.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5336092},{"amount":75,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":227.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957288},{"amount":75,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:12:53Z","rounded_local_amount":227.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227538},{"amount":75,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-17T07:56:01Z","rounded_local_amount":227.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422773},{"amount":75,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:42:43Z","rounded_local_amount":227.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27115996},{"amount":75,"local_amount":216.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:42Z","rounded_local_amount":227.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36010957}],"funded_date":"2008-10-15T23:08:10Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Helen Smith","image":null}},{"id":72468,"name":"Time's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Time J. has been selling maandazi in the Darajabovu neighborhood of Zanzibar for two years.

They owe this to Kiva partner ADIM, who has helped them. Their loans have been invested in the purchase of ingredients for baking bread, which is later sold by the dozen in stores. With the loans from ADIM, they have had the opportunity to improve the lives of their families. They have both invested their profits in their businesses as well as used them to fix up their homes.

For the last two years she has worked selling essential products. In the beginning she rented a small storefront, but currently she works out of her own home where she serves customers all day and at the same time cares for her son.  Aydee is very careful about the amount and type of products she sells and, based on the demand, she buys merchandise wholesale. In the future her wish is to have a grocery store in an area that is more central and commercial than her current location to be able to increase her sales. It is her second loan with MFP and she is very thankful that her communal bank has taught her the solidarity that she now promotes among the people she meets.  The money that she is requesting is for the purchase of products wholesale such as rice, sugar, sweets and soft drinks. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Aimee Sostowski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":311322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-28T10:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aydee","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2068.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733815}],"funded_date":"2009-04-28T13:31:02Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:21:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aimee Sostowski","image":null}},{"id":109332,"name":"Grace","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Grace G. is 49 years old.

Her shop started as a hair salon. Rebecca employs two other people to wash, relax, and style hair. They also do manicures and pedicures. Many of her customers are her neighbors, but some people come from far away because they know of her work. One of the challenges of her business is that if customers don\u2019t have any income, they stop coming to her salon. Therefore, she decided to diversify her offerings and she began to sell other basic grocery items like sugar and onge out of the same shop.\r\n\r\nRebecca is a 30 years old, married, and the mother of three. Her children range from 3-10 years old. Her husband works casually and does not have a permanent job. Besides running this salon, Rebecca is a Community Healthcare Worker; a volunteer in her community. For two days each week she visits sick people in their homes, and counsels them and their caretakers.\r\n\r\nRebecca will use this loan to stock her shop; she will buy more of the products that she is running out of. Rebecca hopes that someday she will be able to grow her business into a large salon with many employees and workstations. Her biggest dream is to open a hairdressing school.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About K-MET:<\/b>\r\nK-MET, the NGO giving the loan, is unique in that it is not a traditional microfinance institution. Rather, it is a development organization focused on raising health standards in Kenya. Many of the loan recipients from this organization are volunteer community healthcare workers like Rebecca.

He is domiciled in Banconi\u2013Koulikoro with his two wives and his children in a district of Sikasso City.  After having run many businesses without success, he got started in the business of storing and marketing grains (corn, millet, and sorghum) seven years ago.  He has a store in Kabo\u00efla I, opposite the Guinso Clinic. \r\n\r\nConcerned about further satisfying his burgeoning customer base, he decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso in 2009.  He has had an initial loan, which was properly repaid.  He is requesting a second loan to buy 28 sacks of corn, and 30 sacks of millet from towns surrounding Sikasso.  These goods are first stocked up in his store and are then resold in bulk to a customer base composed of retailers and heads-of-household.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he envisions making a monthly profit of 180,000 francs CFA.  The profits will be used essentially for helping to cover family expenses and to pay the loan interest.  The rest will be invested in his business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":572195,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buying grains ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdramane ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2011-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":220804,"name":"Rodelisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rodelisa R. is from the village of Bantuanon, Lantapan, Bukidnon.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling wild-caught fish in the local community.  Anita is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Anita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Anita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell.  This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Anita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

After graduating from the Kapan secondary school, he attended the Yerevan State University.  Arshavir's wife does not work and stays home with the children. Their son is two years old, and the daughter is four.  Arshavir's parents live together with them and help him with the farm.  Arshavir has been involved in agriculture in the Geganush village in the Syunik region since 2004.  With the help of his parents, he breeds cattle and chickens.  He also has a land plot, where he grows vegetables for sale.  Arshavir also sells beef, milk and eggs to his loyal customers in Kapan and, thus, supports his family.  This is his second loan from Nor Horizon, and this time he needs a loan in the sum of 450,000 in order to buy hay and medicine for his farm
