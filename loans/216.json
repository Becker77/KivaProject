It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Makhsud is 34 years old, married, and has three children. Makhsud has been a farmer since he was very young. He plants potatoes and other vegetables and also raises cattle at his house. Makhsud alternates the crops so that while one is growing the other is ready to be cleaned and prepared, until finally be begins to plant potatoes again. Growing potatoes is very profitable because there are certain seasons when prices are higher and farmers have the opportunity to increase their capital. Currently Makhsud needs funds for growing his crops and purchasing young cattle, and for that reason he applied to IMON International with the request of 13000 Somoni loan. He will spend this loan for buying seeds, fertilizer and young cattle. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Members typically put in $2 USD per week.  Because UIMCEC and Al Ouma both share the mission of fighting poverty through economic empowerment, they have formed a partnership to provide loans to Al Ouma associations at a lower interest rate than UIMCEC usually offers its clients."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":723041,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To strengthen their working capital\r\n","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"DAKAR","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.695112 -17.443886","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4075,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye Fatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aissatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamadou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1925000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":4075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":160416.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160416.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160416.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160416.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160416.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160416.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160416.67},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160416.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":160416.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":160416.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":160416.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":160416.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":339.58},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":339.59},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":339.58},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":339.58},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":339.59},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":339.58},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":339.58},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":339.59},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":339.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":339.58},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":339.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":339.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":282369,"name":"Antoliana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

She lives in Kurgantube, Tajikistan with her husband, children and mother-in-law. Dilorom works hard, because she wants to improve her life. She is engaged in animal husbandry. Her husband sells car spare parts at the market and he helps his wife in his free time.\r\n\r\nMostly, Dilorom buys a cow with a newborn calf. Then, once the cow stops giving out milk, she sells the cow and keeps the calf.  She sells milk to private entrepreneurs, who produce dairy products.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is here that she manages several businesses.  She launched her first business seven years ago selling fast food and lunches.  From that point, she also began selling products through specialized catalogs and renting out washing machines.  Her main target customers are women with families, and each of her businesses reaches out to that demographic.  Mirela gained her experience while working as an employee for different companies.  This sparked her entrepreneurial spirit despite the fact that she had very little capital.  Her resources gradually increased over time.  She has been able to accomplish all of this with the full support of her husband and the motivation he provides.  Her dream is to have her own shop where she can establish her fast food business and generate jobs so that all of her children can get ahead.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is Mirela\u2019s first loan.  She will use the Kiva funds to buy cooking utensils, pots, plates, chairs, and tables to improve the physical infrastructure of her food business.  While she continues to work toward achieving her dream, Mirela is able to maintain a minimum profit margin of 30%.  She strives to improve on those results so that she can help her children obtain a university education.  Mirela is hopeful that the state will allow them to enroll in any of the national universities they wish to attend.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":791274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cooking utensils, pots, plates, chairs, and tables.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-06-17T05:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mirela Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1070000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":80154},{"due_date":"2011-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":81690},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":83256},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":84851},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":86478},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":88135},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":89824},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":91546},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":93301},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":95089},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":96912},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":98764}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.82},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.72},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.63},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.56},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.51},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.48},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.47},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.54},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.61},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46.82,"local_amount":80154,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:41Z","rounded_local_amount":83103.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673837},{"amount":47.72,"local_amount":81690,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:14Z","rounded_local_amount":84696.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320394},{"amount":48.63,"local_amount":83256,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:20Z","rounded_local_amount":86319.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803513},{"amount":49.56,"local_amount":84851,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":87973.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614600},{"amount":50.51,"local_amount":86478,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:59:07Z","rounded_local_amount":89660.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568556},{"amount":51.48,"local_amount":88135,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:25Z","rounded_local_amount":91378.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779897},{"amount":105.94,"local_amount":181370,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:36Z","rounded_local_amount":188044.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324519},{"amount":54.5,"local_amount":93301,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:47Z","rounded_local_amount":96734.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038577},{"amount":169.84,"local_amount":290765,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T13:21:17Z","rounded_local_amount":301464.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315387562}],"funded_date":"2011-06-23T18:10:34Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T13:21:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":311055,"name":"Rehema","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rehema, a married mother of two boys and three girls, lives in a rental house that has neither electricity nor piped water.

She can manage her activities without having to sacrifice caring for her kids.  Her store has been operational for 4 years now, and she dedicates a great part of her day to selling her merchandise.  She likes her work, because selling and negotiating are activities she enjoys doing especially because of the contact it allows her with other people.  Despite all this, selling the beauty products is difficult without having demonstrations to help customers make their decisions.  Having two young children motivates her and she wants to be able to provide good educations for them so that they can become professionals.  Sara wants to invest in buying more beauty products at wholesale, and wants to use these both for demonstrations and also to sell them quickly without having to wait for the catalog orders to come in.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Para obtener mayor cantidad de dinero ella viajaba a la ciudad de Lima donde comercializaba sus productos, pero ahora el viaje se le hace muy pesado y cansado, por lo que empez\u00f3 a vender a los comerciantes de la ciudad de Tarma a un menor precio.

Two of the children live with her in her own house.  \r\n\r\nSince she became a widow, she started to work her fields more eagerly.  She also sold food in her town\u2019s park in order to get the money to feed and educate her children.\r\n\r\nBut, since she became ill and her children grew up, she stopped selling food.  She does not work much in the fields, either.  Her children now do the heavy work.\r\n\r\nWhat Elena does is prepare the food, and in the afternoon she helps collect the peas.  She likes doing farm work because she has been doing this since she was a child.\r\n\r\nTo obtain more money, she traveled to the city of Lima to sell her products.  But, now the trip is very difficult and tiring for her.  So, she started to sell at a lower price to the business people in Tarma.  Now that her children are adults, they can return to sending their products directly to the Lima markets so that their income gives them the opportunity to improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis is her eighth loan with MFP.  In spite of her lack of savings, she made all of her previous payments.  Even though she has difficulty hearing, she goes to her community bank meetings to keep herself informed of the agreed upon decisions.  \r\n\r\nThe money she is asking for is to buy chemical fertilizers and a bag of pea seeds for the next planting.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":352135,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy seeds and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-14T15:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1522.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734033}],"funded_date":"2009-07-15T00:47:10Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":125828,"name":"Rosario Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosario del Carmen G.

Garc\u00eda lives in the state of Tecpatan, Chiapas, M\u00e9xico. She's married to Fidel Saraos Hern\u00e1ndez. They have a 20-year-old daughter under their care, Matilde, who also supports the household income. This is Mar\u00eda's first loan request, and she plans to use it to invest in merchandise to supply her small convenience store. She has three years' experience with this business and says that it is going very well because it provides income. She started this business after she was encouraged by her children, who are married and said they would support her in starting the convenience store, and in that way support herself and make headway for the family. With what she earns, Mar\u00eda buys things that her household is lacking, often the same stocked goods that end up in her store. What she desires most is for her business to grow day by day, have savings, and keep making headway until she goes to God. She joined the group out of invitation by Ma Luisa. Mar\u00eda liked the idea, so she accepted. The group is called \"Las Turquesas\" (\"The Turquoise\"), and the reason for the name is because they like the smell of this flower. The group members are as follows: Mar\u00eda del Rosario S\u00e1nchez S\u00e1nchez, who will use the loan to purchase fabrics to sell by the meter in the communities; Eunice P\u00e9rez V\u00e1zquez, who will use it to buy dressmaking materials so she can make items to sell; Ma Luisa M. V., who will invest in ingredients to make bread; Ramiro F.

and 11-year-old daughter in the small town of Karabalta. Twenty years ago the family was in a desperate economic state, experiencing great difficulty in covering basic living costs. The development of microfinance in Kyrgyzstan pulled her out of this situation when Olmaskhan received a loan in 1991 to start up a business. Purchasing  potatoes seeds which she then planted on her small piece of land, she achieved a rich fall harvest. <p>\r\n\r\nAgriculture has helped the family improve its living conditions, buy an automobile, and increase the number of cattle the family owns. A monthly income of 6,000 soms, however, is not always sufficient to cover all costs, so Olmaskhan is now requesting a loan from Kiva to pay for the services of a tractor driver and other operating expenses. Olmaskhan hopes to get enough profit so that she can give a good education to her daughter. <p>\r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<p>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.\n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they

Afin de faire face \u00e0 cette inflation, Alakonon sollicite pour son sixi\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit de ALID\u00e9. Alakonon est une ancienne cliente de ALID\u00e9 qui rembourse bien et r\u00e9guli\u00e8re ses cr\u00e9dits.","en":"A. Alakonon was born around 1950 in AGBODJEDO, a working-class district of COTONOU, the economic capital of the Republic of Benin.  She traces her roots to Hlacomey, a district located a few meters away.  She is a widow and the mother of four children, of whom two are girls and two are boys, all of age. \r\n\r\nAlakonon sells smoked shrimp and fresh crabs.  She obtains her products from two fishermen through bartering, that is, the exchange of shrimp and fresh crabs for fishing nets.  Basically she knows two fishermen exceptionally well who she helps by buying nets.  This allows the fishermen to be supplied with effective work equipment.  Upon returning from fishing, these fishermen deliver the fruits of their labor to Alakonon, who finds something there to supply her numerous customers. \r\n\r\nDuring the current rainy season in Benin, the flood waters are rising to serious levels.  Fishing is disrupted, and shellfish are more and more scarce.  As a result, seafood is very expensive right now.  To address this inflation, Alakonon is requesting her sixth loan from Alid\u00e9.  She is a former Alid\u00e9 client who indeed repays her loans and regularly. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":352162,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy fresh shrimp ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Cotonou Agence principale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-07-13T20:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alakonon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":12500},{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:50:34Z","rounded_local_amount":13233.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549938},{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:15:40Z","rounded_local_amount":13233.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86983729},{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:10:42Z","rounded_local_amount":13233.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96896098},{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:08:27Z","rounded_local_amount":13233.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735678},{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":13233.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623189},{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:14:10Z","rounded_local_amount":13233.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118019894},{"amount":28.13,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":13233.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858388},{"amount":28.09,"local_amount":12500,"processed_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:29Z","rounded_local_amount":13233.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136618542}],"funded_date":"2009-07-13T22:35:07Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":125844,"name":"Carlos Arturo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Carlos Arturo Guti\u00e9rrez Garc\u00eda , tiene  41 a\u00f1os de edad, es casado y tiene dos hijos los cuales son menores de edad.

In the future he hopes to increase the number of machines that he currently has.\r\n\r\nThis is Wily\u2019s first loan with MFP.  He knows that he has to make his payments on time, and he is prepared to do so.  He is very respected by the other members in his communal bank.  He will use the 1,000 PEN that he is asking for to fix his Pinball machines.  They has stopped working from so much use.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":422472,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","themes":null,"use":"Repair his video game machines","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-08T20:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wily","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:36Z","rounded_local_amount":169.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843172},{"amount":116.9,"local_amount":334,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:06:06Z","rounded_local_amount":339.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734759},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":169.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959824},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":169.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992669},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":167.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717452}],"funded_date":"2009-11-09T01:04:39Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":154696,"name":"Nwakwabel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nwakwabel is 38 years old and married with three children.

This is the fourth loan with Kiva partner MFP, and Elvis is happy to continue working with each of the members of his community group. With the loan he receives, he will buy potatoes of the Yungay variety and seeds for planting peas.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kara Gibson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":580523,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy seeds for peas and potatoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-09T03:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1540.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326879}],"funded_date":"2010-08-10T05:56:28Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kara Gibson","image":1815905}},{"id":225028,"name":"Saroeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Saroeun K.

This school came about as a result of the community\u2019s dire need and the Baptist mission\u2019s desire to propagate the Gospel of Christ to the children of the community, especially to the girls. \r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational area, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their salaries alone. With the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is responsible for deducting the repayments and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nDavid E. T.

With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lynsey Maness has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 5,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,300, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 4th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use for maintenance of tricycle so that she can continue to save up for the future, to build a new house. Lynsey Maness E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

The group consists of three female members who know one another and are neighbors:\r\n<p>\r\n\u2022\tSra. Aurelia Sol\u00eds M. will use her loan to buy women\u2019s gowns to restock her business.\r\n\u2022\tSra. Blanca Guti\u00e9rrez Dom\u00ednguez will buy chicken and a canvas sign to promote her business.\r\n\u2022\tSra. Juana Guti\u00e9rrez Mart\u00ednez will buy corn, gas, and meat to restock her business.\r\n<p>\r\nSra. Blanca Guti\u00e9rrez Dom\u00ednguez is one of the group members.  She is 33 years old and has her high school diploma.  Blanca has two children.  Irma Samanta is 10 years old and a fifth grade student who helps with the orders in her business.  Brando David is 12 years old, is in the sixth grade, and lives with his father in Mexico City.  Sra. Blanca and her husband have been separated for a year.  She sells snacks and will use her loan to improve her business by purchasing canvas signs to promote her establishment, as well as buy chicken to replenish her inventory.  Blanca wants to convert her business into a Burger Sami franchise that sells fried chicken and hamburgers.  At the moment, her business is called \u201cLoncher\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez\u201d but in fifteen days she will change the name to \u201cBurger Sami\u201d.  Her customers include young families, teenagers, children, and young adults.  She offers her customers sandwiches, hamburgers, hot dogs, French fries, baguettes, quesadillas, flautas, and crispy tacos.  Blanca started this business a year ago, but she has thirteen years of experience as a merchant thanks to everything her husband taught her.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer husband has a hamburger and hot dog business in Mexico City, so he imparted to her everything he knows about this trade.  Blanca started selling at the town festivals.  She borrowed 1500 MXN from her father which she used to invest in supplies.  Blanca borrowed a grill from her mother and bought three tables: one for setting up the grill, one for holding an ice chest, and another for keeping all of her ingredients.  Her business is in a rented location in the center of Ciudad Ayala that occupies two rooms of her house that is within walking distance.  This business is very important because it enables her to feed, clothe, and support her daughter. Her favorite part about her business is that she is her own boss.  If she feels sick or has to attend to an emergency, then she closes her business.  \r\n<p>\r\nBlanca is proud that she does not depend on anyone else.  Her greatest challenges are the rising costs and low sales that occur during the vacation season in the months of July, August, and December.  The earnings from her business are invested in clothes, shoes, and the household expenses.  Blanca wants to start selling another type of food, Kentucky Fried Chicken, so she plans to start a promotion with new signs and invest more into his product.   \r\n<p>\r\nHer business has helped her family whenever she has had to repay her parents for groceries, food, and tanks of gas.  Blanca owns a piece of land where the foundation of her house has been built, but it still lacks walls and a roof.  She wants to keep progressing so that she can build rooms that she can set aside for her business.  Blanca is pleased with this loan and confident that she will continue working to move forward.  With this loan and any subsequent financing, she hopes to grow her business even more.  She wants to make these improvements in the future so that her children can have a good education and a better lifestyle.  Sra. Blanca lacks additional education and there are many more things that she has to learn.  Fortunately, she has friends who do not speak badly about her and treat her like an equal.  \r\n<p>\r\nCiudad Ayala is a beautiful place with a warm climate.

Carlos learned to work from the time he was very young, because his parents had little income, and so in this way he was able to support them.  Due to a lack of financial resources, he was only able to get a high school education, but he would have liked to have been able to study at a university.\r\n\r\nEach day, Carlos works in his drywall business.  He works about 10 hours a day, and over this time he tends to about 16 customers a day.  He believes that his business is doing well because he is very friendly, and most of all, is responsible in his work.\r\n\r\nCarlos is very grateful to the Kiva lenders, because thanks to the help that they are providing him, he will be able to buy tools for his work, such as: a saw, measuring tools, step stools, and other items.  In this way, he will be able to provide better service and can continue to strive to make his greatest dream a reality: to study for a professional degree in interior design. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1235355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to buy tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":161.89},{"due_date":"2012-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":213.78},{"due_date":"2013-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":218.46},{"due_date":"2013-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":226.97},{"due_date":"2013-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":244.13},{"due_date":"2013-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":245.29},{"due_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":256.99},{"due_date":"2013-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":264.82},{"due_date":"2013-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":276.61},{"due_date":"2013-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":285.88},{"due_date":"2013-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":297},{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":308.18}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.41},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.73},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.56},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.9},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.62},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.07},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.65},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.72},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.97},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":992133,"name":"Damai's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Damai is the simple lady standing to the right hand side of the photograph.She lives with her husband and two sons in a village of Koraput district,Odisha,India.She is a farmer and cultivates paddy from last 5 years in order to supplement her family's income and provide a better standard of living to her sons.Her husband helps her in the field to harvest the paddy and they lead a very contended life.\n\nDamai along with her group member is requesting for a loan amount of 30,000 INR from Kiva's partner Peoples Forum.

is 47 years old, she is married, and has four children, one son whom they adopted. Josephine is married to a pastor, so apart from her tailoring work, she also works part time to assist her husband with church work. Apart from her children who are now grown up and in various colleges, Josephine also has two dependent children that she supports through paying their school fees back at home. Being the wife of a pastor also requires her to offer support to the members of their church and she therefore also supports two single mothers and one widow who is also her employee.\r\n<p>\r\nJosephine started her dress-making business in order to sustain her family in 1992, after she received a loan of Ksh7,000 (USD100) from a local NGO. This loan was to be shared amongst three people and was meant to be used to start a business. The three started a small business in partnership, but within a short time, the other two partners requested that Josephine take over the loan repayment, and to employ and pay them on commission. Josephine later attended a two-year course training in embroidery, tie-dye and fashion design. With the new skills learned, Josephine began to make bridal wear, African attire and even began to make curtains. \r\n<p>\r\nSince then, her business has expanded from a small stall which three people shared, to the four stalls that she now owns in the Jericho market, one of the market areas in Nairobi. Josephine now seeks additional support in the form of a loan to enable her to buy bridal wear materials in bulk. For this, she seeks a loan of USD725 repayable within 6 \u2013 12 months. Purchase of these materials will enable her to cut the cost of the materials that she buys in small bits. This will also enable her to give reasonable prices to her customers, and will at the same time ensure that she gets higher income. This will improve the situation at her business, and will help her to continue to maintain her staff. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":21638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase bulk materials for making wedding gowns","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kayole, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.283333 36.933333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-03-27T20:40:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-11T03:48:32Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":725,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2007-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2007-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2007-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2007-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2007-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":120.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":120.83},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":120.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":121,"local_amount":121,"processed_date":"2007-05-27T09:17:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:00:38Z","rounded_local_amount":121,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":17717},{"amount":121,"local_amount":121,"processed_date":"2007-06-27T09:17:59Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:00:38Z","rounded_local_amount":121,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26538},{"amount":121,"local_amount":121,"processed_date":"2007-07-27T09:20:45Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:00:38Z","rounded_local_amount":121,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36043},{"amount":121,"local_amount":121,"processed_date":"2007-08-27T09:22:45Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:00:38Z","rounded_local_amount":121,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47075},{"amount":121,"local_amount":121,"processed_date":"2007-09-27T09:23:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:00:38Z","rounded_local_amount":121,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59373},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2007-10-27T09:25:17Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-28T20:00:38Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":72747}],"funded_date":"2007-03-28T03:48:32Z","paid_date":"2007-10-27T09:25:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":10,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11148,"name":"Gloria Cecilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hello, my name is Gloria Cecilia, and I am a businessperson.

Palma, which is on the outskirts of Hato Mayor. Nieves lives with her husband and 15-year-old daughter in a small home. She started a small business two years ago selling homemaD. food to her community members. She is requesting a loan so that she can buy more flour, oil, plantains, and chicken. Nieves operates her own `fritura,\u00b4 a small business that makes homemaD. snacks, such as empanadas.  In the Dominican Republic, it is very common for people to buy a snack on the street corner as they walk to work, their homes, or simply when they are out and about. The money from this loan will help Nieves to buy enough ingredients to make the food necessary to meet the demands she faces. She hopes that her business will continue to grow and become more stable with the help of this loan.  The profits she makes will enable her to better proviD. for her family.  On behalf of everyone here at Esperanza International, and from Nieves herself, we thank you for your support with this micro loan!\r\n\r\nThe loan will also help fund the businesses of the other group members. \r\n\r\nAbout Group Loans: In a group loan, each member of the group receives an individual loan but is part of a group of individuals bound by a group guarantee.

She chose this work because she saw a good development opportunity for her family.  She began with one cow, but now has three.  Every day she goes out in the morning to take her cattle out to graze.  She also benefits from their milk, which she sells every day. Isabel's cows eat a daily diet of alfalfa, which Isabel harvests from her own fields.

This is a small settlement around one of the many sugar cane fields in La Romana. The sugar cane fields are owned by a private company, who also owns the houses in the batey and has some control over the commercial activities allowed inside the batey. This forces many of the batey inhabitants to leave their home and their children for extended periods of time to sell their goods. \r\n\r\nMariluz M., the group coordinator, has 3 children (ages 11, 9 and 4). She sells two different things: candy and snacks, which she sells from a palatera (a small market stand) and chorizo (a type of sausage). This loan, which is Mariluz's very first loan with Esperanza, will allow her to purchase merchandise for both of her sales. \r\n\r\nHowever, Mariluz does not intend to remain a seller. She intends to learn beauty culture and open a beauty salon in the near future.

She is 48 years old and for the past 20 years she has run a small home-based grocery store.  She has accomplished this with the help of her husband and with financing from Afodenic, which has allowed her to invest in a variety of merchandise.\r\n\r\nHer husband is a construction worker.  They have five children, three of them are adults and two are students.  Her earnings have allowed her to make improvements to their home.

She has tried many things to improve her family's economic stability; she previously sold clothing, but had many difficulties and was not able to spend much time with her family. Because she did not have much money, she decided to invest her savings in supplies and sell them to her neighbours. Little by little her store has been growing, and although she does not have many products she continues working to expand her inventory. She sells rice, sugar, oil, etc. \r\nWith the requested loan, she wants to buy supplies such as rice, sugar and oils for her store.

to raise children and to take care of their needs every day. At home, she is accompanied by a nephew and niece. She makes them feel loved and is helping in making their lives comfortable. In a way, she feels as though she is the real mother of her loving nephew and niece. From them, she draws out strength and determination to work hard and improve their standard of living. Nevertheless, Elenie still looks forward to having her own family in the future. But, meanwhile, she wants to be financially stable. \r\n\r\nTo be able to reach her dream of having a stable source of income to support her above-mentioned aspirations, she joined ASHI in 2003. Loans made to her since then until the present have enabled her to start raising hogs and buying and selling them as a business. All throughout her membership, Elenie has never been a problem for her co-members in terms of payment. \r\n\r\nShe believes that fate has been good to her without giving her a hard time to manage her business. After four months of raising her hogs, she sells them either alive or slaughtered to people in her village and sometimes in the market. Along with that, she also buys different commodities for selling. \r\n\r\nElenie enjoys spending the small profit she earns through the business to give her niece and nephew necessary things. However, thinking about a better kind of house to comfort and shelter her and the children she is taking care of, the urge to grow her business further becomes so intense. Because of that, she is requesting a much larger amount of loan for the financial capital growing her business requires.

Gladys is the mother of two responsible daughters and struggles in life to provide them with a good education.  She has made sacrifices to operate her modest business, but it has been profitable.  Gladys started selling hamburgers two years ago and has obtained good results.  For this reason, she was motivated to apply for a loan in order to buy a larger food cart so that she could prepare more hamburgers in less time and make her customers feel comfortable.  Being a woman entrepreneur, Gladys values the effort she puts into the work she performs every day from 6pm to midnight.  Her daily routine enables her daughters to have a decent education.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She lives with her husband and their children in her own house. Since she was very young she has been working in the fields, and with time she has turned her work into an indispensible source of income. Thus she works every day and into the night, driving out to the fields to look after them. She also keeps animals, including sheep, cows and pigs, which she takes to the fields for pasture. She works alongside her whole family, and when her husband is involved, between them they are assured of having the income to support their family. Rayda is very satisfied at their continuing progress. She has decided to further improve their crop with better seed, however, because although the harvest so far has repaid the work they put in, there is always the risk of losing a harvest through bad weather. This is her first loan from [field partner] MFP. She is very happy in the knowledge that she can access such financial support, and is grateful to be part of her communal bank because all the members are responsible people who will stick together. She is also grateful to the lenders who will come forward to offer the money she is looking for, because it will be very useful in progressing her work. The loan she is seeking will be invested in buying sacks of fertilizer, and in employing casual labourers to help till the earth for the next planting."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":723201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

In spite of this, he continues to get ahead in life and care for his 4 children who live in their own home in the town of Uni\u00f3n Palomar (in the central Peruvian jungle).  \"Constant work\" is Eugenio's motto since he has been working tenaciously in the field of agriculture for 40 years.

As his coffee harvest takes place once a year, Eugenio hires staff to support him in extracting his beans.  What he most likes about his work is the determination and effort that he puts in which is clearly reflected when he harvests and sells all of his crops.  A little while ago, he used his profits to open a grocery store where he sells essentials.  This makes him daily profits.

She is the proud owner of a small parcel of land on which she has been practicing mixed farming for the past five years. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs, and some variety of crops she plants. \n\nJane passionately loves farming, and she says that she got interested in farming out of a desire to be a solution to food problems in her area. From farming, she has been able to earn a decent income, and she attributes all this success to hard work and determination. Although she makes profits, she has always wanted to increase her farming and start a cereal-selling business. The main challenge she has been facing is lack of funds. \n\nShe is seeking a loan to buy cereals. Demand for cereals is overwhelming in her remote village, and through your loan, she intends to buy different varieties of cereals and be able to satisfy the demand in her village and the local market.

She began in 1998 when one of her brothers started a business selling \"gorditas de ma\u00edz\" [corn flour biscuits] near the local university; the business was very successful. As Martha was then helping her brother with his business, he encouraged her to establish her own business in another neighborhood.  She did so, and since then it also has been successful, seeing she has established two selling points in different parts of the city.  Since receiving her previous loan from Kiva, Martha has been able to open a third \"gorditas de ma\u00edz\" selling point in the specially adapted courtyard of her home.  This also has been successful.\r\n\r\nMartha needs a loan of $575 -- which she will pay back in 5 months -- to purchase basic ingredients for making the \"gorditas de ma\u00edz\" she sells.  This will keep her loyal clients happy.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Todd M.

She sells candy and snacks from a 3-wheeled cart. She offers a wide variety of cookies, candies, soft drinks, etc. She has been doing this work for thirty years in order to be able to cover her living expenses. She really enjoys it, and it is her only form of entertainment. It makes her very happy to interact with the people who buy from her, especially the children. The hardest part of her work is that she has to stay seated in one place almost all day while she sells her merchandise, but she has gotten used to this and stays focused on all of the positive things that her work brings her.

This is 30 year old Latifa K. from Mbarali. She is married with 2 children, between the ages of 7 and 13. Latifa has been running a beauty salon since 2007. Hair, hair and more hair! This is the place where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or plaited, and made to look like your own.\n\nShe works at the business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by 1 employee. Latifa currently earns about 300USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 475 USD in order to purchase cosmetics and makeup for her salon. In the future, she plans to to start a new business. Latifa thanks you for your support!\n\nABOUT SELFINA:\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":271538,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since

They live together in the town of Santa Rosa, located in the beautiful Ayacuchan jungle, where they have their own adobe house. In spite of not having gone to school due to her economic situation, this was not an excuse to not do anything.  Since then she sells cocoa, and with time this product had a lot of demand on the national and international level.  Today she sells to big wholesalers, and she feels happy because she comes crossing and doesn't regret for having bet on agricultural activity.  Also she is sure that she is doing well for the environment since her products are net organics.\r\n<p>\r\nGenerally she works together with her husband, but in the sowing season, she needs her farm workers to help her extract her fruits.  Normally she sells her product in the wholesale centers of her town, for a competitive price.  Her future plan is to continue growing her agricultural production of cocoa, and for that she will buy more hectares, with the aim to be able to plant her product, and in this way improve her socioeconomic level.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP, and she therefore assures that she will faithfully complete her payment obligations.  Also, she feels comfortable with her community bank, due to the transparency that the members offer.  With the loan she is requesting, she is thinking to invest in the purchase of fertilizer so that in this way, she can offer the proper maintenance to her cocoa plantations, with the aim to avoid damaging them.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amy McGinty, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":596119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-06T22:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Justina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269309}],"funded_date":"2010-09-07T14:57:40Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy McGinty","image":348203}},{"id":233256,"name":"Julia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Julia de 33 a\u00f1os vende leche.

children: leparakuo, aged 22 years, Olobulu aged 20 years, Naeku, aged 17 years, Ntanani, aged 15 years and Nkaleyia, aged 12 years. They live in Bissil village and trade livestock at Bissil market in Kajiado, which is a busy market. Tenke sells his livestock to butcher men in Kitengela and Kajiado for slaughter. \r\n\r\nTenke was introduced to KADET by other KADET clients.

He started working in the biggest market in Ecuador named Bahia. His boss at a previous business sent him to rural towns to sell his products. When Victor and his wife decided they would go into business together, they based their business model on Victor\u2019s previous job. They had success early on because they knew exactly which towns were the most lucrative markets, and they offered promotions to the best buyers, whom they knew personally.<\/p>\r\n<p>Each day they work from 5am until 10pm. They have recently been so focused on sales that they have not had the time to replenish their inventory with new stock, so they sell goods in the morning and then use the proceeds from those sales to buy just enough shoes to still sell in the afternoon. Victor\u2019s wife is a great salesperson, and she typically sells in the small towns and at the local festivals which occur fairly often.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>They have two grown children who help sell their goods, and the family unit has maintained a strong foundation over the years. Their house is their greatest collateral. Victor will used his second loan to continue to increase the volume of shoes and clothing in stock to sell when the Riveras go to market. He is a 48 year-old with four children, who also contribute to the family business. His wife is his right hand, and he could not do anything without her. She is responsible for the finances, taking care of the house, and looking after the children. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many years ago they lived in Victor\u2019s mother-in-law\u2019s home, but they saved enough money to move out on their own.

He was trained to be an elementary school teacher.  He is married and the father of 4 children, 2 girls and 2 boys, all are adults (the oldest is 32 years old and the youngest is 22).  The first two are already employed, and the other 2 are studying at the university but are still his responsibility.<p>\r\n\r\nErnesto and his family moved from the province of Gaza to Namaacha in 1986 due to a job transfer so he could work as a professor in the teacher-training school located in Namaacha.  Since then Ernesto and his family have lived there and he works in the same school.<p>\r\n\r\nErnesto has a monthly salary of 7,400MTn and works from 7:30am to 10:00pm with a 2-hour lunch break.  Besides 2 of his children, Ernesto supports two nephews in the Chibuto province of Gaza sending them 1,500MTn monthly.  Still he is able to save approximately 2,500MTn per month with the help of receipts from a small stand he possesses.<p>\r\n\r\nIt has been 10 years since Ernesto began his selling activities in a small stand (store) in response to the increase in the cost of living.  His activities consist of selling a variety of drinks and basic staple products.  The best seller is a national beer with a 2M mark that is acquired for 200MTn per box and sold for 300MTn.  The monthly receipts vary between 2,000MTn and 3,000MTn depending on the time of year (winter or summer, respectively).<p>\r\n\r\nErnesto has his own home.  This is his second loan with Hluvuku and the first with Kiva.  The first loan for 20,000MTn was used to purchase construction materials to build a coop to raise chickens, a business that still isn't up and running.  Ernesto paid that loan off early and without difficulties.<p>\r\n\r\nWith this loan Ernesto intends to purchase products for his stand, increasing his stocks as well as his sales.  In the future Ernesto would like to purchase baby chicks to begin his poultry business now that the coop is almost finished.<p>\r\n<b>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nErnesto tem 55 anos de idade e nasceu na prov\u00edncia de Gaza. Ernesto fez a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de professor prim\u00e1rio, \u00e9 casado e pai de 4 filhos, sendo duas meninas e dois rapazes, todos j\u00e1 maiores de idade (o primeiro filho tem 32 anos de idade e o ultimo 22 anos). Os dois primeiros j\u00e1 est\u00e3o empregados e os dois \u00faltimos estudam na universidade sob sua responsabilidade.\r\n\r\nErnesto e sua fam\u00edlia mudaram-se da prov\u00edncia de Gaza para Namaacha em 1986 devido a transfer\u00eancia que ele teve para ir trabalhar na escola de forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos professores situado em Namaacha como professor. Desde ent\u00e3o Ernesto e sua fam\u00edlia l\u00e1 vivem, Ernesto ainda trabalhando na mesma escola. Ernesto tem um sal\u00e1rio mensal de MTn 7,400, trabalhando das 7:30h as 22:00h com intervalo de 2 horas de almo\u00e7o. \r\n\r\nErnesto para alem dos dois filhos  sustenta mais dois sobrinhos que se encontram em Chibuto prov\u00edncia de Gaza, enviando mensalmente MTn 1,500. Ainda assim consegue poupar do sal\u00e1rio aproximadamente MTn 2,500 com ajuda das receitas da pequena barraca que possui.\r\n\r\nH\u00e1 dez anos Ernesto iniciou a atividade de venda em uma pequena barraca (loja) como resposta a subida do custo de vida. A atividade consiste na venda de variedades de bebidas e produtos de necessidade b\u00e1sica, onde destaca com mais sa\u00edda a cerveja nacional de marca 2M que \u00e9 adquirida por MTn 200 a caixa e vendida por MTn 300. A receita liquida mensal varia entre MTn 2,000 a MTn 3,000, dependendo do per\u00edodo do ano (inverno ou ver\u00e3o, respectivamente).\r\n\r\nErnesto tem casa pr\u00f3pria. Este \u00e9 o seu segundo empr\u00e9stimo na Hluvuku e primeiro no Kiva. O primeiro empr\u00e9stimo de MTn 20,000 foi usado para compra de material de constru\u00e7\u00e3o para construir uma capoeira para cria\u00e7\u00e3o de frangos, negocio ainda n\u00e3o iniciado. Ernesto pagou este empr\u00e9stimo sem dificuldades antes do tempo.\r\n\r\nCom este empr\u00e9stimo Ernesto pretende comprar produtos para sua barraca, aumentando assim o estoque e as vendas. No futuro Ernesto gostaria de comprar pintos para iniciar sua atividade av\u00edcola, j\u00e1 que esta quase conclu\u00edda a

She's 43 years old, married, and mother to six children.  The eldest is 26, and the two youngest ones are 13-year-old twins.  All are still students.  Besides her family, she helps her mother, sending money to the town of Pemba.\r\n\r\nPaulina studied until 7th grade in the old national system of education.  She stopped her studies due to health problems and financial difficulty in paying the fees.  Paulina left Cabo Delgado, accompanied by her husband, who was transferred by his work, and they have been here until today.\r\n\r\nPaulina works at selling clothes, a business that she learned from her sisters ever since she was little.  Her best product is clothing made out of African wax print cloth, sold for 125 meticais per blouse and 950 meticais for a suit.  She has a monthly income of 5000 meticais and saves 2000 of it.\r\n\r\nFor Paulina, this is her first loan from Hluvuku and Kiva.  She has never solicited a loan from other institutions.  She heard of Hluvuku through friends who are clients.  She plans with this loan to increase her amount of stock and supply more products for her clients.  She has a dream of constructing a store with future loans.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Ilse Ackerman, Kiva

He is an honest man who has been working for a business installing parquet floors for nine years.  He has great talent for this work, and with his earnings is able to meet his expenses.  German does not have a set schedule since contracts come in sporadically.  However, when he is contracted out he works hard for three weeks or more.  It is work that requires great precision.  The most difficult part is that it is not stable employment and, at times, he receives many contracts but there are also weeks at a time when he may not receive any work.  German wants to be a useful man, and knows that life still provides many opportunities which he wants to be prepared to confront.  With the money from the loan, he wants to buy his own tools for parquet installation so he can also do work independently.  In the future, German would like to have his own business in his current line of work but also would like to start another enterprise which he has yet to decide on.  <p>   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":220458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase the necessary tools to carry out his work, so that he can also take on projects independently.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-04T12:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"German","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-18T15:22:21Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:24:21Z","rounded_local_amount":178.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957577},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:07:41Z","rounded_local_amount":178.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227833},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:06:32Z","rounded_local_amount":178.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423062},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:38:29Z","rounded_local_amount":178.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116298},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":166.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:48:18Z","rounded_local_amount":178.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011250},{"amount":58.35,"local_amount":166.65,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":178.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594853}],"funded_date":"2008-11-04T15:22:21Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":76740,"name":"Mrs. Samouern Sok Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Village Bank loA. group consists of ten members who live in Phsar village in Kampong Chhnang Province.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Paralelamente a esto, Lorenzo se dedica a la ganader\u00eda, ya que tiene 4 vacas en su establo, de ellas extrae la leche para su consumo propio y para venta. Para Lorenzo y su familia dedicarse a las tareas agr\u00edcolas es la \u00fanica fuente de ingresos que poseen porque no solo les genera recursos econ\u00f3micos, sino que tambi\u00e9n les provee de alimentos b\u00e1sicos para su hogar. Es la segunda vez que Lorenzo est\u00e1 solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y es de su agrado trabajar con sus propios vecinos, los cuales forman parte de su banco comunal. El dinero que ahora requiere lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de sacos de abono y fertilizante para sus cultivos.","en":"Lorenzo, 42, lives with his wife and 4 children in his own home.  \r\n\r\nFor more than 15 years he has been working in agriculture and with livestock.  He got started in this work because he inherited some land from his parents and from his wife\u2019s parents.  From then on they have been working the land tirelessly year after year as they follow the schedule for planting and harvesting.  \r\n\r\nAlong with this, Lorenzo has livestock.  He has 4 cows in his stable.  He milks them for his family\u2019s use, and he sells the rest of the milk.  The agricultural work is the only source of income for Lorenzo and his family.  This work not only generates economic resources, but it also provides them with basic foods for their home.  \r\n\r\nThis is the second time that Lorenza has asked for a loan with MFP.  It is his pleasure to work with his neighbors who form part of his community bank.  He will use the loan to buy bags of fertilizer for his crops.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":302950,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-13T22:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorenzo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2044.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842061}],"funded_date":"2009-04-16T02:41:20Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":105412,"name":"Ana Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ana Maria C.

She is married to Amorin, a motorbike mechanic by training and a seller of radio receivers.  Edith and Amorin have one son, who attends school. She attended school, but she stopped in primary school.  Together with her husband, she is meeting family expenses.  \n\nSauce condiments are what she sells, as well as baggies for packaging, as her secondary business.  She buys her goods in Dantokpa, the international grand marketplace of B\u00e9nin. She sells the condiments out of her house;  the baggies are sold door-to-door.

2-year old daughter in his parents\u2019 house, located 25 minutes from the city of Chiclayo in the Santa Rosa district.  The need to work to support his family led him to start a small business selling fresh fish on foot.  He usually works at night as an assistant in a bakery in the area.  For the past six months, he has also been working selling fish in the towns located in the Monsef\u00fa district, which is ten minutes from where he lives.\r\n\r\nHe goes very early to the docks to buy his fish, and then travels to Monsef\u00fa to sell his product.  He arrives home in the afternoon, rests, and then goes to the bakery to work.  The income he generates through these activities helps him get ahead in supporting his family and his parents.\r\n\r\nAlan wants to gather enough funds to start his own bakery, since he very much enjoys this activity and has been learning the trade for some time.  However, he is conscious that he must continue selling fish in order to save money.  For this reason, he is approaching Edpyme Alternativa for the first time for a loan of 900 soles.  He thinks he will invest these funds into the purchase of more merchandise to strengthen his enterprise.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to buy some land on which to build his own house.  Alan is well-known and respected by his neighbors and workmates, who consider him a charismatic, responsible and hard-working young man. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":391021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fresh fish to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Santa Rosa - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2009-09-19T12:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alan V\u00edctor","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":78.08},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":80.34},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":81.92},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":87.68},{"due_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":93.18},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":93.99},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":101.09},{"due_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":104.37},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":108.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.58},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.2},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.01},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.58},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.66},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.69},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.58,"local_amount":70.84,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T18:57:07Z","rounded_local_amount":74.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96939723},{"amount":28.2,"local_amount":78.08,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":81.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103780631},{"amount":29.01,"local_amount":80.34,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:48:25Z","rounded_local_amount":84.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110669531},{"amount":29.58,"local_amount":81.92,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:16:06Z","rounded_local_amount":85.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118065038},{"amount":31.66,"local_amount":87.68,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:47:16Z","rounded_local_amount":91.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123900152},{"amount":33.65,"local_amount":93.18,"processed_date":"2010-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":97.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934287},{"amount":33.94,"local_amount":93.99,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:54Z","rounded_local_amount":98.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661927},{"amount":36.51,"local_amount":101.09,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":105.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694643},{"amount":37.69,"local_amount":104.37,"processed_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":109.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877708},{"amount":39.18,"local_amount":108.51,"processed_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:30Z","rounded_local_amount":113.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617761}],"funded_date":"2009-09-19T16:58:54Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":142348,"name":"Besilia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Besilia is from the village of Calamagui San Pablo, Isabela.
