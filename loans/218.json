She needs a loan of 3,500,000 CRC ($700) in order to make repairs to the electrical wiring and to other areas, so that the apartment can be used.\r\n\r\nMs. Mayra is part of the \u201cLa Fuente Agricola Empresarial\u201d communal bank, one of the 100 organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.

She earns an average monthly income of PHP 6000. \r\n\r\nErlinda is now borrowing PHP 15000 to purchase more stock for her general store. This will be her 5th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Erlinda aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She lives in Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1992 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her sari-sari (general) store, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Emma is borrowing PHP 19,500 so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 19th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Emma aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He lives with his partner and their two children, aged 3 and 9. Although Edgar was born in Santander he moved to the department of Altantico for work. His family is very hard working and his mother always had a store. And so he too continued in this legacy and once he settled in the city, he also started his store, one he still has today. He sells food products and grocery merchandise. He started this business with his brother, eager to accomplish his dream. With his savings he gradually established his own with positive results. This is his first loan with Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner) and he plans on spending his Kiva loan on food products and groceries in order to increase his sales. His dream for the future is to have his own house and he has already started to work towards his goal. His greatest challenge was accessing a loan because he did not have a credit history.

Today she became an entrepreneur running her small kiosk selling toys and games. \r\n\r\nLyubov is very generous. She has a kind and caring heart. Her love for children motivated her to choose this sphere of business. Being a sociable person, Lyubov manages to find common language with every client. Every time you pass by her kiosk you can see her talking to a new person who will definitely end up buying something. Lyubov has worked with \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d since 2003. She has repaid 16 loans. She is always telling others about lending services \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d can offer to small business owners.\r\n\r\nLyubov needs a loan of $800 to increase on stock for Christmas season (December 25th \u2013 January 14th  in Ukraine).  She wants to buy stuffed toys, table games, Barbie dolls, puzzles, construction pieces etc. in bulk from wholesale distributors. Lyubov has worked in this business for over 3 years. She knows exactly what kids will like and how to make a child happy. She doesn\u2019t have to advertise her trade stalls because attractive toy displays and bright colors draw potential clients to her kiosk. Being a good steward of the money she receives, Lyubov will manage the loan efficiently and repay it in time.

To be able to have greater income, Gerardo also runs a kiosk that is situated very close to the crossroads denominated Pribebuy branch.  His principal clientele are the \"chiperas\" stationed near his business that are more or less some 15 saleswomen of chips (a very typical snack of our country), and so these are also the travelling salespeople in the area.  Gerardo is a highly respected man in his community due to his honest work and his great worth as a person; he forms a part of various community groups with the aims of growing and bettering his neighborhood.  The loans previously obtained from la Fundacion Paraguaya he has invested in the purchase of merchandise to stock his kiosk such as sodas, beer, sweets, etc..  He wishes to solicit a new credit that he will invest in the purchase of sweets, sodas, dairy products and snacks since the demand for these products is on the rise and the purchase of these products at wholesale will generate greater discounts that will augment his revenue.

She lives in a neighborhood of the capital, Managua, which is called Memorial Sandino. She is the single mother of an eighteen-month old baby, who she leaves with her mother to care for her little daughter while she is working in a chicken agency, Tip Top, serving fast food. It is a hard job since she leaves at an early hour from her home to get to work. She began working here fifteen months ago since her husband died in an accident and she has to find an alternative way to satisfy the needs of her baby.

In the long run, she wants to have another job that will give her a better income and be able to save money to make her home since that is the dream of every woman and to see her daughter with good health.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jay Osborne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":220833,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Construction of a room","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-11-19T23:00:56Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Cristina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.85,"local_amount":506.39,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:57:41Z","rounded_local_amount":543.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9893479},{"amount":27.15,"local_amount":493.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:23:44Z","rounded_local_amount":529.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816563},{"amount":28.22,"local_amount":513.07,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":550.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351260},{"amount":28.54,"local_amount":518.84,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":556.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038589},{"amount":28.04,"local_amount":509.9,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":547.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35928888},{"amount":28.09,"local_amount":510.72,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:26:08Z","rounded_local_amount":547.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44383813},{"amount":28.17,"local_amount":512.25,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:31:34Z","rounded_local_amount":549.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890289},{"amount":28.04,"local_amount":509.73,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":546.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111611},{"amount":27.86,"local_amount":506.52,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:50:05Z","rounded_local_amount":543.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533044},{"amount":23.04,"local_amount":418.91,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:56:59Z","rounded_local_amount":449.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86965423}],"funded_date":"2008-11-19T23:55:27Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T09:56:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jay Osborne","image":883556}},{"id":76852,"name":"Sardarn M.nawaz Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sardarn baji is the wife of M.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ms. C. is a member of the ALCOM LAS ESTRELLITAS D. MARQUEZ Group, which consists of 12 members. <p>\r\nShe learned about the group after she was invited to join. She is currently the president, and has held this post for a year-and-a-half. <p>\r\nShe states that she started out selling beauty products. She used to sell the products that she had in stock. She first set up a mini bazaar where she sold her products, concurrently selling gifts and candy to get by. She worked so hard that she would sometimes stay until midnight. For a while, she was also a street vendor at a market, selling her beauty products. She did this in order to improve her household income and collaborate with her husband in obtaining a plot of land on which they can start building their house. After much hard work, they managed to obtain the car that her husband uses for work. The company for which he used to work went under and he was left unemployed. <p>\r\nMs. C. feels very proud of her achievements because she has been able to improve her and her family\u2019s quality of life. This business has allowed her to proviD. her 4 children with a better education. She is currently helping her daughter who is attending college. She will invest part of this EDAPROSPO loan in her business, and the other part in building her house so that she can rent out rooms, thus assuring her family\u2019s future.\r\n* Ms. C. is sitting in

For her entire life, she has been involved with agricultural work, currently she is sowing potatoes, beans, and corn.  She also raises pigs as livestock in the same stable.  She sells the pigs that she has while she is waiting for the harvest.  When the season arrives, her work in the crop lands intensifies, and she carefully selects the production that she would later sell little by little in accordance with the demand of the market.  It is better for Eduarda to sell when they pay more per kilogram and for this reason, she has a big warehouse where she saves her harvests.

The greatest difficulty she has is not having safe transportation to transport her merchandise.  She has occasionally lost her products.\r\n\r\nWith her first loan she was able to get more inventory and provide for her customers.  She started this activity upon liquidation of her previous work.  She has the support of her four children, who help in the business on different days.  They are in school to be able to help their mother economically in the future.  They will also be able to provide better living conditions.\r\n\r\nShe is grateful to the institution for the loan, which she will use to buy clothes and shoes to increase her business.\r\n<br

C. is a widow  who lives in Magsasaka, Brgy.

She has one child who is 25 years old. \r\n\r\nVilma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Vilma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 25,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 63,000 PHP, bettering the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 10th cycle loan, she is borrowing 25,000, which she intends to use to buy more stocks for her general store and gear and parts for her fishing boat. She hopes that she could save enough from her earnings for the future education of her grandson and improve the quality of life of her family.  Vilma C. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She has a small liquor store that she has run from her home for the last 20 years, where she and her daughter both work. Her husband also helps out when he is not working at the vegetable stand he has at a local fair. Maria, her daughter and her husband all work with Fondo Esperanza [the Kiva field partner]. Her daughter, who has a 5-year-old son, also makes fresh bread on the weekends to sell from their home.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Maria plans to buy both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Her dream is to have a well-built house, made of good solid materials, because she lost both her house and all of her merchandise in the earthquake that hit Chile this past February. After the earthquake, Maria, her husband, her daughter and her grandson lived in a tent for one month. Through Fondo Esperanza they were able to get a small temporary dwelling made from wood panels. \r\n \r\nMaria is very thankful for the support that Fondo Esperanza has given to her and her family, not only for the loans but also for the concern that they have shown them, particularly after the earthquake.\r\n\r\nSan Vicente de Tagua Tagua is a community in Chile's central zone, in the region of Libertador General Bernardo O\u2019Higgins, located on the banks of the Estero Zamorano river.

Elle exerce ce commerce il y a 12 ans et ma\u00eetrise certaines techniques de commerce par son exp\u00e9rience. Elle avait b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 par le pass\u00e9 de deux cr\u00e9dits qu\u2019elle avait su bien g\u00e9rer et rembourser parfaitement sans incident.

La r\u00e9alisation de projet lui permettra d\u2019accro\u00eetre son activit\u00e9 et de facto, augmenter sa rentabilit\u00e9 et ses revenus pour les besoins de sa

Kayumjon is 50 years old. He is married with three children. Kayumjon is the sole breadwinner for his family and his only income comes from the cultivation and sale of large livestock at the local market. \n\nEvery year, he buys young heifers from the farms in adjacent villages. He raises them with the help of his wife and children and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers. Today Kayumjon is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd isn't enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase additional young cattle. To do this, he needs to invest an additional $1,200 in his business. In order to receive this amount, Savridin has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner organization, IMON International.   \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n \nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has 3 infant-aged children.  To make a living, Anarosa owns and operates a business venture making and selling food.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling fried foods in the local community.  Anarosa has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 500 WST a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nAnarosa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Anarosa successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products to sell. Anarosa is now requesting a new loan of 1250 WST, which will also be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products to sell. The loan will be the third loan taken out by Anarosa from SPBD.  Anarosa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives with husband and six-year old son in their own house. They are very close and do everything together. They work hard so as to have more money and improve their standard of living.\r\n\r\nJessica sells groceries in her popular store situated in a busy street. She sells everything, from the smallest to the biggest item, from medicines to sandals, as well as vegetables, toys etc. The store is located in her house and she\u2019s been running it for seven years. All is going well, and Jessica believes this is because she has known for a long time how to run a business. She feels very lucky to have her husband\u2019s support; he drives a taxi and is an important contributor to the household. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning Jessica was very fearful about starting a venture on her own, but need and a desire to overcome difficulties gave her the strength necessary to overcome these problems. Now she is very happy because she doesn\u2019t have to answer to anyone and chooses how to best spend her time. Her short-term goal is to put her business on a sound footing by expanding the store and having more products for her customers. \r\n\r\nThis will be Jessica\u2019s seventh loan with MFP, and she hopes this will be sufficient for her to meet her goals. She promises once again to make her repayments on time as she has done in the past.

Kokir Village in Takeo Province. Mrs. Thoeurn P. is the village bank president who has been selected by the members. She is a farmer who owns 0.5 hectare to cultivate rice on. Her husband, Mr. Tuy Rom, is a construction worker who can make only a small income to support his family. Aside from this activity, he is a breeder who is raising two pigs. <P>\r\n\r\nSince this business is going well, he wants to expand it so his wife decided to ask for a loan to buy more piglets to for breeding in order to improve their living conditions. Mrs. Thoeurn P. is 32 years old and the mother of three children, one of whom is employed in a garment factory while the others are attending the local school. <P>\r\n\r\nAll the members in this village bank have end-of-term loans so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to.

","en":"Gonzalo is a 35 year old man who is married with 2 children, aged 2 and 7.  He lives in the Barrio Fabril zone near Blanco Galindo Avenue at Km. 7 in the Colcapirua Zone of Cercado Province.  This zone is considered agricultural, since it is on the outskirts of Cochabamba City.\r\n\r\nGonzalo drives a taxi along the zone's routes.  His wife works in a school in the community of Pucarita Chica, 3 hours travel from home, requiring 3 changes of buses.  But they have adjusted to the schedule and its requirements and are accustomed to rising very early every day.  Their young children remain in the care of their grandmother while both parents work mornings, but they are very young.  And the youngest has a harelip which was operated on with foreign assistance but he still requires the care and attention of the parents for his recovery since there were complications.  For that reason, Gonzalo's wife had to take a year off from work.  Now that their little one is better and has recuperated, both parents are determined to work hard in order to recover from the child's operation.\r\n\r\nGonzalo requests a loan to buy replacement parts and to carry out general maintenance on his taxi.  He tells us that one of his major dreams is to make enough one day so that his wife can stop working and devote herself 100% to their children. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold

She lives with her husband, Jorge, who is 50 years old, and one of her five sons in their own home.  She posses a large area of land, where she plants coffee and pineapple with the help of her husband, who takes care of the crops on the weekends.  Monday through Friday, she works as a vendor selling jello.  She has been doing this for the past 10 years.  Meanwhile, she works during the day at a popular cafeteria making food in exchange for groceries for her and her family.  Her husband makes about S\/. 30,00 to S\/. 40.00 soles a day, which is more than enough to live comfortably since her children are adults and independent.  What Maria loves most is taking caring of children because they are a great distraction.  In the future, she plans on installing a small convenience store in her home, since she is tired of walking for long hours and working long stretches to care for her cultivations.  This is her fifth credit with MFP and she is very proud to be a part of such a well organized, responsible, and supportive group.  With the loan that she is seeking, she plans to purchase more merchandise, such as household necessities and groceries, in order to expand her store.     \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish

However, Margarita does not have the amount of money needed, which is why she is asking for a loan which she will invest in the purchase of the machine and with this her income will increase and proportionally and significantly improve her quality of life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":906112,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy an overlock sewing machine for sewing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bello","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2011-10-28T13:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":27,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35642},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36638},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37663},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38716},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39798},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40911},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42054},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43230},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44439},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45681},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46958},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48270}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":19.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.15},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.72},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.29},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.89},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.5},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.13},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.78},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.44},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":19.12,"local_amount":34761,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:20:58Z","rounded_local_amount":35751.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244600720},{"amount":19.35,"local_amount":35185,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:51:33Z","rounded_local_amount":36187.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257224033},{"amount":41.88,"local_amount":76142,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:06:38Z","rounded_local_amount":78312.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270075796},{"amount":21.78,"local_amount":39601,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:43:35Z","rounded_local_amount":40729.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276902619},{"amount":22.34,"local_amount":40622,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":41779.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287432509},{"amount":22.53,"local_amount":40955,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:58:19Z","rounded_local_amount":42122.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294378604},{"amount":48.42,"local_amount":88037,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-17T08:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":90546.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308617884},{"amount":51.78,"local_amount":94148,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T14:18:21Z","rounded_local_amount":96831.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331165156},{"amount":27.8,"local_amount":50549,"processed_date":"2013-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-03-15T13:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":51989.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347097809}],"funded_date":"2011-10-28T13:48:18Z","paid_date":"2013-03-15T13:45:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":356392,"name":"Lucrencia","description":{"languages":["pt","en"],"texts":{"pt":" Nasceu no Distrito da Manhi\u00e7a, Prov\u00edncia de Maputo, Sul de Mo\u00e7ambique, viuva e ma\u00ea de 5  filhos destes  2 ainda frequentam escola.

On average they are paid Rp35,000\/day.  (Translator\u2019s note: 1 US$ fluctuates between Rp9,000-9,500.00). Every day those 3 carpenters could produce about Rp250,000. Not included electricity expense and equipment wear and tear.\r\nHis products results are quite good, clean and guaranteed quality, since all carpenters work in their expertise, so that his customers increase.\r\nDinari gave Rp10,000,000 additional loan for Uma Wardana, that was used to buy furniture making machinery and other raw materials.

She is a single mother and lives at home with her parents and her little 4-year-old son Carlos.  She wishes to give him a good life and offer him a good education.  Tatiana can be found at the Santa B\u00e1rbara market (an important market in Juliaca).  She has a phone center where she also sells her artificial flowers.  She sells roses, carnations, violets, etc. in a small corner.  They are very pretty flowers and priced reasonably.  She enjoys talking with the other sellers and doesn\u2019t miss an opportunity to sell them a flower to decorate their stalls.  She suffers a lot in order to get the flowers since she brings them from Bolivia.  Tatiana has been in this business for 4 years and it is going very well for her.  She still doesn\u2019t feel fulfilled since she would like to open a bigger store just to sell artificial flowers in order to pay for her dear son\u2019s education.  This is Tatiana\u2019s first loan with MFP.  She knows she has to meet her payments and she hopes to be able to do that.

T. (7) is a 74-year-old female living in the town of Thanh Hoa. She is the group leader of a six-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.

The official name of this borrowing group is 05-Dong Hai (016-06-05 Dong Hai).\r\n\r\nMui is widowed and has five adult-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store, selling confectionery products in the local community.

Mui has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,248,000 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 5,787,900 VND which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This will be her 8th loan from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women. Mui plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies.\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  D.

What she likes best about her job is advising her clients about which products are appropriate for their specific skin type.\r\n\r\nLia has been in this business for three years and finds that the most challenging aspect of her work is having to knock on doors all day in search of clients. She will use the current loan of 3000 soles to purchase more beauty care products in the city of Lima so that she could offer her customers a wider range of options. With time, Lia hopes to put up her own cosmetics store where she could sell her products in a more comfortable setting.

Patrick is a hardworking, ambitious and go-getter farmer who is 36 years of age. He hails from Gitugi, a small village in the Thika area of Kenya. He comes from a very humble background, and did not manage to attend college, but that did not kill his spirit to succeed. \r\n\r\nHe has actively been involved in farming for the past eight years. Although he has made great strides in farming, he wants to diversify his farming, and is kindly seeking a loan to buy goats. \r\n\r\nGoat farming is one of the profitable agricultural ventures in Kenya, and Patrick, having an entrepreneur's mind, wants to take advantage of that to improve his living conditions. Patrick loves goat farming because goats are not demanding to keep, unlike poultry, which require special care and attention. \r\n\r\nPatrick believes that with the loan his life will permanently change because he will be selling goat meat and dairy goat milk to the ready market that is available. As far as the market of goat products is concerned, demand is greater than supply. Patrick always says to become a successful goat farmer you need three ingredients, and that is getting the right breed, giving the right feed, and proper care.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, he believes he will become a successful goat farmer and be able to realize his dream of transforming his life. Having been farming for the past 10 years, Patrick finds it very enjoyable to raise goats because he does not spend more money on buying food. Patrick will also sell manure from the goats and use it on his farm, also saving much more money and improving his living conditions. \r\n\r\nProfits from selling goat meat to the local market and goat milk will be used to fully repay the loan."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1863624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy goats","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Thika","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":707.73},{"due_date":"2015-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":728.41},{"due_date":"2015-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":749.7},{"due_date":"2015-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":771.6},{"due_date":"2015-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":794.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":817.37},{"due_date":"2015-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":841.26},{"due_date":"2015-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":865.84},{"due_date":"2016-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":891.15},{"due_date":"2016-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":917.19},{"due_date":"2016-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":944},{"due_date":"2016-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":971.59}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":8.85},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.11},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.37},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.64},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":9.93},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.22},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.52},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":10.82},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":11.14},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.46},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":11.8},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":992341,"name":"Perihan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Perihan is divorced and has three children.
