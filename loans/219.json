Because his parents did not send him to school beyond 5th grade, he must rely on his rice farming knowledge to feed his family. He has two kids, aged 10 and 16. He hopes that he can provide them with better a better future than his by giving them an education. With the loan he will invest in machinery for collecting the raise after it has grown. With the profits he hopes to make improvements to his home. <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> Mario is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":25060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-10T17:18:51Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-26T02:54:27Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":825,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":117.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":118,"local_amount":118,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":118,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21388},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T23:14:41Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40776},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T18:08:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45295},{"amount":567,"local_amount":567,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:07:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":567,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99049},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T21:48:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106809}],"funded_date":"2007-04-12T02:54:27Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T21:48:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11744,"name":"Nizami","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nizami N.

She learned the ropes of buying and selling fresh fruits and vegetables by working alongside her mother for 22 years. When she got married, she started her own business called \"La Guadalupana fruit sales\". She sells fruits both wholesale and retail, including apples, mangos, pineapples, and papayas. In the summer she specializes in selling fruits that grow in coastal low lands, and in the fall she sells elote, cooked corn on the cob. She travels every Saturday to the main market in the regional center of Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa to purchase her whole week's inventory and then returns back to her home where she sells the fruit.\r\n<p>\r\nCarmen is married and has 6 children ranging in age from 19 to 4 years old. Her husband works in the fields cultivating crops and brings home very little money due to the poor wages and seasonality of his work. So her income is an important part of supporting her family, and she is very proud to have the wherewithall to earn it. Her dream is to provide an education to all of her children. So far she has been successful. Her oldest daughter has already graduated and now is employed as a teacher. Paying back the loan monthly is another important goal which because of her own commitment she has been successfully doing. She realizes that by being in this program she can grow her business a little bit at a time and better herself and her family slowly but surly.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is a religious person and calls upon God to help her resolve the lingering problems with her first husband. She decicates her free time to working in her church and hopes that with God's help she can find her way though this challenge. \r\n<p>\r\nInterviewed by Lucia Tunay Ixcol<br\/>\r\nWritten by Nancy Lewis and Randy Fay, Kiva Fellows"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":70541,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fruit for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"San Pedro Yepocapa, Chimaltenango","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.504167 -90.956944","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2007-09-30T23:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-15T01:42:01Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":675,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2007-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2007-11-15T10:21:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":81886},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2007-12-15T10:21:11Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97478},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-01-15T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116028},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-02-15T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":135750},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-03-15T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":158364},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-04-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183035},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-05-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":210563},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-06-15T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238684},{"amount":75,"local_amount":75,"processed_date":"2008-07-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-15T09:26:26Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":267549}],"funded_date":"2007-10-01T01:42:01Z","paid_date":"2008-07-15T09:05:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":24033,"name":"Zarif","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zarif has been in business for over 15 years.

Every year he makes a good profit from his land, and from his savings he purchased a car for the transportation of his crop.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Jenny started selling breakfast and lunch at her house, and little by little began buying food, a freezer, and plates to establish her restaurant \"Buffet 'J and M' Ketherine\",  which she has been running in her home for the past seven years.\r\n \r\nJenny has taken various cooking classes and began to teach in the municipality, as she works in the area of  workshop production.  She started her business when she began working with Finca (the microfinance partner).  Jenny is very grateful for all that she has been to do with the help of loans and the culture of saving money that she learned.  Finca gave Jenny a method to work with, and she likes the Bancomunal meetings where she can interact with other people who have a business vision like her own. \r\n\r\nJenny needs a loan of 3,000 Peruvian Soles to purchase kitchen utensils, cups, plates, and cupboards, because renting these goods is very costly.  Jenny's dream is to have her own home, and together with her children, continue with her restaurant.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Lucas, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":260450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase material inventory for her restaurant.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenny Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:23:44Z","rounded_local_amount":504.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20397272},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:11:29Z","rounded_local_amount":504.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088976},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:02:45Z","rounded_local_amount":504.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982312},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":504.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44442861},{"amount":316.68,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:26:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52953273}],"funded_date":"2009-02-03T23:25:56Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T20:26:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Scott Lucas","image":133535}},{"id":89592,"name":"Julia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Julia S.

She is currently hoping for her fourth loan as she has made great progress since she first joined.  She is hoping for a loan in order to expand the number of items she sells through her food stand.  She would like to add flour, seeds, palm oil, bananas, and cocoyams to the items she currently sells.  Tanjong considers her business will succeed because she has always experienced strong sales through her food stand.  She expects the expansion of products available at her location will strengthen her offering as well as strengthen her relationship with her customers.<P>\r\n\r\nTanjong is an enthusiastic individual who, despite severe hardships, has managed to maintain a positive outlook on life.  Tanjong\u2019s most difficult loss was the recent passing of her husband.  She felt a deep pain at the loss of her spouse and leaned on her friends and family during her difficult time of mourning.  She considers the best manner by which she can contribute to her community is to provide healthy food as well as the option of a nice room in her house for a reasonable rent.      <P>\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.<P>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":431465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of vegetables, fruit and palm oil for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Musang, Bamenda, NW.

hog-raising businesses. Tirelessly making and selling her candy directly to people in the market to earn money for herself and her two children, Amparo also accepts as many orders for her product as she can accommodate.  She sometimes has to turn down orders due to insufficient capital, the same problem that affects her hog-raising business. Her desired growth for a hog after four months or so is often not achieved because she can\u2019t afford to buy the necessary food. This in turn reduces the profits she is trying to earn to make her life as well as her children\u2019s comfortable. <p>\r\n\r\nAlthough Amparo\u2019s two children are already 29 and 37 years old, she still feels responsible for making their lives worth living for. Her 29-year-old daughter, a high school graduate, is a contract-based sales lady in one of the stores in the province. Her other child is a special child who needs her financial and emotional support. With these considerations, Amparo would like to request a loan to finance her plan to grow her businesses. Once they are stable, she will have a valuable inheritance for her children to enrich and maintain in the future. Despite the fact that she is an elderly widow, her love and concern for her two children provide her with the strength to live and continue dreaming.\r\n

Dadap, Solano, Nueva Vizcaya. She is 46 years old. Mary Jane is married and has 4 infant-aged children. To make a living, Mary Jane owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling home products such as glasses, plastic wares, and watches in the local community. Mary Jane has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3,200 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mary Jane joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mary Jane is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Mary Jane from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She would also like to help her children be able to study.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":304081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Comprar materiales de construccion para hacer un muro en la parte de atras","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-04-16T19:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha Del Socorro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1200},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":61.36,"local_amount":1227.29,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:32:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1242.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890840},{"amount":61.08,"local_amount":1221.62,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1237.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63112147},{"amount":60.57,"local_amount":1211.39,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:47:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1226.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533549},{"amount":61.03,"local_amount":1220.57,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1235.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86964911},{"amount":61.85,"local_amount":1237,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T10:46:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1252.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96875365},{"amount":54.11,"local_amount":1082.13,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T10:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1095.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103713306},{"amount":67.26,"local_amount":1345.16,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:57:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1362.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601007},{"amount":60.25,"local_amount":1204.97,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:52:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1220.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118002487},{"amount":60.46,"local_amount":1209.18,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1224.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123840667},{"amount":52.03,"local_amount":1040.69,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1053.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128873620}],"funded_date":"2009-04-18T22:59:07Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shelly Hubman","image":226625}},{"id":105992,"name":"Ludy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ludy L. is 41 years old, residing at Gango, Ozamiz City with 2 children, and her husband is a tricycle (three-wheeled vehicle) driver in the City of Ozamiz.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She tells us that the small house in which they live is very old, and they are in the process of constructing a new one, but the family was missing the resources necessary for the completion of the project.  For this reason, they are now asking for a loan which will be used to purchase construction materials so that Judi can achieve her dream to finish the construction of her house to give her family,

The name for the group came from a perfume brand name that they like and this is how their group is identified.  \r\n\r\nElaine has been working in catalog sales  for fifteen years and she is requesting a loan to buy more merchandise. She wants to  increase her business income as she needs to buy the merchandise first and then sell it.  She started this business to earn some money since she is a single woman with no one supporting her.  She needed to earn money to support herself and help her family with the household expenses.  With the income she is earning from her business she will buy more merchandise in order to be well stocked and keep her customers satisfied.  She will also be happy to make money on every product that she sells.  She wants her business to grow a little more every day so that she can rely upon it and get ahead.  What she desires most is to be able to buy construction materials to build a house.

Most of her customers are people who used to wake up early in the morning for work or studies who do not have enough time to cook for themselves and still others are tricycle operators and drivers who just parked their units in front of her store while waiting for passengers. Rhodora and Antonio gather a net income of PHP 10,000 monthly, which they use to meet the needs of the entire family.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 22,000 loan. Rhodora plans to use this loan to further her food vending business and to finally install their own electrical power supply.  Basically, the loan will serve as additional capital that will enable Rhodora to make her business more profitable and lead to more savings.\r\n\r\nAt present, Rhodora experiences complaints from her customers about the quantity of her food serving because she just adjusted it due to increasing prices of the raw ingredients she uses at present.  She is determined not to be swayed by these struggles, explains to them these adjustments and aims to make her business grow.  Rhodora dreams of seeing her children finish their studies and be used as one family for the glory of the Lord whom they serve.  As a CCT community partner, Rhodora attends faithfully to their weekly fellowship* meeting where she can draw inspiration and strength from the Word of God she received.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.

Afterwards, she got together with her friends and neighbors to create what became the group. All the women united around the proposal of improving their condition of life and that of their families.\r\n\r\nOne of the members is Andresa who has a notions shop where she sells all sorts of articles, including items of clothing, gift articles, and other things.

James lives in a town called Ruai on the outskirts of Nairobi. James is a businessman. He runs a general shop which is situated at the Ruai Center. James started off as a waiter in a hotel from the year 2002-2003, but he decided to quit the job due to poor working conditions including a very low salary. In the year 2004, he started a green grocery stand with savings which he earned from his previous job. Through the profits that he earned from the grocery, he expanded his business and started selling cereals and stocking items like sugar, flour and salt.\r\n<p>\r\nJames's business has been doing well, although he finds that he has been unable to increase his stock due to lack of finances since he has a business to run and also a family to support. As a result, his business has come to a standstill while he has been wondering where he can get money since the few banks that he tried to approach charged high interest rates that he felt he could not pay. While still wondering about this, he noted that his friend and neighbor, Mary Wamaitha, who is a beneficiary of a Kiva loan, had suddenly raised her business from nowhere, and it was growing fast. He therefore inquired how she had managed to do it so quickly, and she informed him about Kiva. He was greatly impressed. Mary went further and brought him to the ANK offices so that he could also receive support. \r\n<p>\r\nJames is kindly requesting a loan of US$650 which he will use to stock his shop with cereals like maize, peas, beans, rice, sugar, and flour, among other items. He believes that, with this loan, he will be able to expand his business and increase the number of customers he has. This way, he will be better able to support his family. Since he is a young person, he also hopes that he will be able to expand his business up to a wholesale level over time.\r\n<p>\r\nThe repayment period for this loan will be 9 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":99820,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase stock for a general store, including cereals like maize, peas, beans, rice, sugar and flour etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ruai, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2008-01-01T08:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"James","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-15T15:06:01Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.44},{"due_date":"2008-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":4444.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":72.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-02-15T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:03Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":135692},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-03-15T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":158282},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-04-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:34:02Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182975},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-05-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:34:47Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":210469},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-06-15T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238604},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-07-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:35:44Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":267485},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-08-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-28T19:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":296683},{"amount":73,"local_amount":4492.31,"processed_date":"2008-09-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-16T07:04:07Z","rounded_local_amount":4577.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":327299},{"amount":66,"local_amount":4061.54,"processed_date":"2008-10-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-16T07:04:04Z","rounded_local_amount":4138.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":360799}],"funded_date":"2008-01-01T15:06:01Z","paid_date":"2008-10-16T07:04:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":32257,"name":"Ludmila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Ludmila is an enterprising business owner from Pavlograd in central Ukraine.

G.  es un se\u00f1or de 58 a\u00f1os de edad, quien vive en una casa propia junto a su esposa ya que sus cuatro hijos ya viven fuera de la misma. \n\nLa comunidad en la cual vive don H\u00e9ctor se llama El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Provincia de Cartago.  Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica. Actualmente los precios del caf\u00e9 y la leche han mejorado, por lo tanto los vecinos buscan c\u00f3mo invertir en proyectos en la misma zona y de esta forma evitar migrar.\n\nDesde hace tres a\u00f1os don H\u00e9ctor se involucr\u00f3 en la tarea de producir leche y queso como una forma de generar ingresos para su familia. Sumado a esto, hace dos a\u00f1os se  instal\u00f3 en la comunidad una planta de elaboraci\u00f3n de quesos, propiedad de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de Leche de El Sauce, motivo por el cual  le vende sus productos a esta planta. \n\nEl queso de la regi\u00f3n donde vive don H\u00e9ctor  es famoso en todo Costa Rica. Es un queso fresco que se le conoce tradicionalmente como \u201cqueso tipo Turrialba\u201d. A los \u201cticos\u201d (como se les conoce a los habitantes de Costa Rica) les gusta mucho consumir este producto; se le encontrar\u00e1 en las mesas acompa\u00f1ando cualquier tipo de comida, especialmente en los desayunos  junto a tortillas, arroz, frijoles, huevos, el t\u00edpico \u201cgallo pinto\u201d, entre otra variedad de comidas.  Por esta raz\u00f3n, el mercado para dicho producto es realmente bueno.\n\nLo que desea don H\u00e9ctor por el momento es obtener un micro cr\u00e9dito para comprar una vaca lechera m\u00e1s y as\u00ed aumentar la producci\u00f3n de leche. El sabe que contar con una vaca m\u00e1s es un mayor sacrificio y demandar\u00e1 m\u00e1s trabajo pero dice que si quiere sacar su familia adelante tiene que esforzarse en producir m\u00e1s. \n\nDon H\u00e9ctor  es cliente de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Productores de El Sauce, una organizaci\u00f3n local socia de la micro financiera EDESA. Gracias a su vinculaci\u00f3n con esta organizaci\u00f3n ha obtenido ya 5 micro cr\u00e9ditos y los ha cancelado satisfactoriamente.

Their four children are grown up and live on their own.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The community where Hector lives is called El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, in the province of Cartago.  It's a small rural community of approximately 2000 people.  The residents of the community work primarily in dairy (milk production) and cultivation of coffee.  The local terrain is a bit rough, and the climate is that of tropical forest.  There are many picturesqe paths running through the area that combine the tropical forest with two pretty lakes, along with coffee plantations and dairies.  El Sauce is about one and a half hours by bus from Turrialba, the closest commercial zone.  However, many times during the year the road is impassable due to the rains.  This is no doubt one of the disadvantages of the community.   <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> When there is no work, many people opt to leave to look for work in Turrialba, or on banana farms located in the Atlantic zone of Costa Rica.  Lately, the prices for coffee and milk have gone up, so more people are trying to work in the area instead of migrating away.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> For three years Hector has worked producing milk and cheese to generate income for his family. To help with the local economy,  two years ago a cheese factory was set up in the community, and now Hector can sell his milk to the cheese factory.   The cheese from this region is famous in all of Costa Rica.  It's a fresh cheese that is traditionally known as \"cheese of Turrialba\".  The \"Ticos\", as the people of Costa Rica are known, like this cheese a lot and you will often find it at meal times served with all sorts of food, especially at breakfast.   They eat the cheese with tortillas, rice, eggs and beans amongst other dishes.   For this reason, demand for the cheese if very high. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> Hector would like a loan to buy an additional dairy cow and increase his production.   He knows that another cow means a sacrifice and much more work, but he says that if he wants to continue to support his family, he will need to produce more.    Hector is a client of the Association of Producers of El Sauce, a local organization affiliated with the micro finance entity EDESA.   Thanks to his involvement with this organization, Hector has been given 5 micro loans, all of which he has paid back on time.    The new loan will be used to purchase the additional dairy cow.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Charnes, Kiva

Bashorat, a 44-year-old woman, is married with three children. Bashorat cultivates a small farm, which she has done for more than five years. She grows different types of vegetables and wheat. Everyday she gets up very early. At 5 am, she drives to the produce market in the capital to sell her products, while her husband and sons take care of the daily work on the farm. \r\n<p>\r\nBashorat is very proud of the work they've done together as a family, and grateful that they've been able to acquire the comforts they have in their home. They have made good use of loans, since nowadays it's very difficult to get ahead without the extra help. Bashorat has applied for a loan from IMON International for the first time. This loan will be used to buy fertilizer, seeds and insecticides that they need for their farm.   \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Bateyes typically lack potable water and any kind of reliable electricity, and have far from sufficient medical services.

They either choose to be independent or are forced by circumstances. Anyway, we see a general trend that women provide for their families, become independent of their husbands and gradually move from lower positions to the positions of CEO, leaders of political parties, diplomats, deputies and even presidents. \r\n\r\nAigul T., the leader of the group, is one of those women who were forced to start businesses in order to raise and feed their children after being divorced. She is 36 and has three children. Her elder son is 15 and her daughters are 13 and 3 years old. She doesn\u2019t have a university degree from a top business school, but she found skills and the knowledge to earn money. \r\n\r\nShe started her business by cooking pies, samsy and ashlyamfu (Kyrgyz traditional food) 12 years ago with an initial investment of 3,000 soms and each month she receives 10,000 soms as income. Now, her son and daughter go to school and the youngest daughter goes to kindergarten. With her children, she dreams to buy a big house. She already has accumulated a considerable amount of money. However, she cannot afford to buy the house of her and her children's dreams yet. \r\n\r\nThus, Aigul decided to broaden the sphere of her business. She decided to buy school and office accessories in Bishkek (capital of Kyrgyz Republic) and then resell them at a higher price in her village (the Issykkul region of the Kyrgyz Republic). She is asking for a loan because she doesn\u2019t have enough funds to realize the above described business idea.\r\n \r\nGroup members:\r\n\r\nGulbarchyn O. is treasurer of the group. She is 62 and a widow. Her children are grown up and live independently of their mother. She has a cattle-breeding business. The business was started three years ago with the initial investment of 8,000 soms and has a monthly income of 5,300 soms. She helped one of her children with the beginning of construction of a new house. Now she wants to help her son repair his truck. Thus, she is applying for this loan.\r\n\r\nBakytbek K. is 35 and recently married. He was working in a dental clinic but due to the low salary, he decided to open his own dental clinic. He started his business five years ago with the initial investment of 2,000 soms. Now he receives 15,000 soms monthly. He is applying for a loan in order to buy necessary medicines. \r\n\r\nMaksatbek M. is 25 and married. He has a son who is 3 years old. He is a taxi driver in the military registration and enlistment office. His wife is a shop assistant. Still, their wages are not enough to live together and raise their 3-year-old child. Together with his wife, he started a bakery business one year ago with the initial investments of 500 soms. Their business brings them 9,100 soms monthly. They already have bought a boiler and they are applying for a loan in order to buy a microwave and flour. Together with his wife, they are planning to open a cafeteria. \r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.Mol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3 Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

La coordinadora del grupo es la sra. Mar\u00eda Ana T. Matute, ella tiene 55 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada y tiene seis hijos, y junto a su familia reside en la ciudad de Juticalpa, Olancho.  Mar\u00eda Ana se dedica a la venta ambulante de productos de uso personal y cosm\u00e9ticos, ella trabaja 4 horas al d\u00eda ya que padece del Colon y de Soplo en el coraz\u00f3n y eso le impide emplear m\u00e1s horas de trabajo diario. Su ventaja es que los productos que ofrece se venden muy r\u00e1pido, ya que a las mujeres siempre les gusta verse muy bonitas y su dificultad es que vende al cr\u00e9dito y en ocasiones sus clientas le quedan mal con el pago. Su sue\u00f1o es tener algunos empleados para aumentar su \u00e1rea de ventas y obtener m\u00e1s ingresos. Ella solicita el financiamiento para comprar perfumes, cremas, shampoos, acondicionadores, listicks, sombras de ojos, r\u00edmel, desodorantes, etc, ya que en esta \u00e9poca del a\u00f1o sus proveedores tienen muchas promociones y quiere aprovecharlas. Tiene varios ciclos en FAMA y est\u00e1  muy agradecida con el apoyo que ha recibido porque su negocio le ha permitido suplir sus necesidades m\u00e1s b\u00e1sicas.

Matute, who is 55 married with 6 children and lives with her family in the city of Juticalpa, Olancho. \r\n\r\nMaria Ana makes a living selling cosmetics and related products door to door. She only works 4 hours daily since she has colon problems and a heart murmur and those keeps her from working longer. Her advantage is that the products she sells move quickly since women always like to look nice. A disadvantage is that she sells on credit and sometimes her customers don't pay on time. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a few employees to expand her sales territory and increase her income. She is requesting a loan to buy perfumes, creams, shampoos, conditioners, lipsticks, eye shadow, mascara, deodorants, etc, since this time of year her suppliers have great deals and she wants to take advantage of them. \r\n\r\nShe has had several loans with FAMA and is very thankful for the support since her business has allowed her to meet her basic needs.

Personal characteristics? Relationship with environment? Or competitive advantage? All of these characteristics are related to our next ambitious borrower, but the main driving force is a unique idea and a strong faith in accomplishing it.\r\n\r\nGulnara M., 32, is the treasurer of this group. At this moment she is a housewife with two kids, but she has big business possibilities in the future. Gulnara\u2019s husband is a truck driver. Several times a week he has to make hard long trips to remotest areas of the country. Transporting a large number of goods requires much patience and endurance. \r\n\r\nTheir children are six and three years old and can now be taken to a daycare. So Gulnara plans to start a business selling consumer goods and groceries in a market in her hometown of Kerben. The wholesale goods will be brought by her husband during his trips. This will help her cut the  transportation costs significantly.   Her husband\u2019s salary has already allowed the family to purchase several heads of cattle and send them to Gulnara\u2019s parents for tending. \r\n\r\nThe returns from the new business will be spent on constructing a house and setting up their own private shop. Gulnara would be very thankful to all lenders, since having a chance to sell goods in a local market is very important for her family\u2019s well-being. \r\n\r\n  --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Eida's husband has a workshop where he sells second-hand fridges besides doing fridge maintenance. \r\n\r\nEida's husband wants to buy five second-hand fridges he found at a very good price. As he doesn't have the whole amount needed, Eida took out a loan from FATEN so that her husband can purchase the fridges.\r\n\r\nThe store where Ala is photographed (instead of conservative Eida) is located next to Shate' refuge camp.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She has been separated for six years, and lives with her 17 year-old daughter, her daughter-in-law, and her granddaughter, whom she loves very much. They are comfortably settled in their own house. \r\n\r\nMaritza sells merchandise, such as clothing and shoes for ladies, men, and children. She started out with her own capital, that she sent it to a family member in Lima, who in turn sent her the merchandise. Now, she herself makes trips to Lima to personally choose the best designs, to then sell to family members, neighbors, and friends. Often, she sells for cash, and sometimes on credit payable in two weeks. She sells and collects on her own. \r\n\r\nShe likes her business, as it allows her to have her own free time to use in other activities.  As well, she can see her working capital grow, and with the earnings she can pay for her household expenses.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, she says that doesn't like it when some of her customers don't make their credit payments. But in spite of that, she has plans to open a clothing store; whether in her home or in some commercial area of the city. \r\n\r\nThis will be her first loan with MFP, so she is hoping for your contribution, she that she can continue toward her objectives.\r\n\r\nShe will use the entire amount of 800 nuevos soles applied for, to buy merchandise such as children's clothing, for this Christmas sales season.

In fact, if you are a regular lender on kiva.org, you may be tired of reading about kuku. Who or what are \u2018kuku\u2019, you may ask. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, they require little start-up capital, you can start with one or two and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiple naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. I\u2019m sure there are hundreds of other reasons why raising kuku is so popular (maybe they are friendlier than other animals? Prettier?), but this is all time and space will allow.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":171589,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy food and drugs for poultry farming.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-06-18T20:10:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rose M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-02T21:00:25Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-08-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":105781.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":284141},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-09-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-19T07:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":105781.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":314318},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-02T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-12T07:17:38Z","rounded_local_amount":105781.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":345749},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":105781.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347771},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:40Z","rounded_local_amount":105781.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970345}],"funded_date":"2008-06-18T21:00:25Z","paid_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":56853,"name":"Sim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sim S., 47, sells vegetables in the local food market and makes US$6.60 each day.

Por el momento, a cada una de sus siembras no las abona con fertilizantes qu\u00edmicos, solo se dedica a remover constantemente los surcos de sus plantaciones y las va abonando con guano de sus aves de corral, de lo cual su esposa es la encargada de acumular en un lugar apropiado. Avelino nos comenta que este tipo de agricultura la practicaba su padre, sembrados de este modo, los frutos tienen mayor duraci\u00f3n en el mercado, mientras que aquellas frutas que han sido cultivadas con productos qu\u00edmicos tienden a pudrirse r\u00e1pidamente, y otra ventaja es que no requiere de mayor inversi\u00f3n, por ello se siente satisfecho y complacido con la tierra. Avelino es uno de los clientes que no falla en cada una de las reuniones programadas por su analista de cr\u00e9dito. Este es su 2do pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, en la cual hace compromisos de seguir con la misma responsabilidad en cada uno de sus pagos. El dinero que solicita es para mandar a quitar las malezas de sus cultivos, por aproximarse los meses de cosecha, asimismo comprar\u00e1 machetes para sacar los arbustos.","en":"Avelino is 40 years old, he has lived with his wife for a year and has a young son with her.  In his youth, eager to have cultivable lands, he felled trees and cleared undergrowth in order to convert these terrains into cultivable fields - now that years have passed, these lands produce coffee, cacao and citrus fruits, all of which are very profitable.  At the moment, not one of his crops is fed with chemical fertilizers, and he only needs to continually plough his furrows and fertilize them with manure from the birds he kept, which his wife is in charge of keeping in an appropriate place.  \r\n\r\nAvelino tells us that this is the type of farming his father used to practice: sown in these ways, the fruits have a longer life-span in the market, while fruits which have been cultivated with chemical products tend to rot quickly.  The other advantage is that it doesn't require large investments, which means he feels satisfied and please with his lands.  \r\n\r\nAvelino is one of those customers who never misses a meeting with his credit analyst.  This is his second loan with MFP, for which he has promised to continue with the same responsibility in meeting each one of his repayments.  The money which he is asking for is to be able to clear the undergrowth from his lands, as the harvest months are approaching, so he will buy machetes in order to pull out weeds and shrubs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katy Long, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":304149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Cleaning and clearing out his fields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-16T22:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Avelino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:07Z","rounded_local_amount":303.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640936},{"amount":227.5,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:45Z","rounded_local_amount":708.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842091}],"funded_date":"2009-04-17T02:14:22Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"katy long","image":null}},{"id":106024,"name":"Mandela A Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariam J., 45, is married with six children, who are 22, 21, 20, 18, 16 and 12 years old.

She sells door-to-door to her neighbours and passersby. She faces the major challenge of high transportation costs. She travels from Kenya to Tanzania to purchase Khangas of good quality, hence the high transportation costs incurred. She hopes to open a shop to sell Khangas in the future. \r\n\r\nHer major reason for working with Yehu is because of its accessibility to sustainable financial services.

V. is 67 years old, married, and has 2 children.  Her  20 year old son is in his 5th year of secondary education and her youngest son is 15 years old and is in his 4th year of high school.  Her husband is a security guard.  Candida's goals are to better supply her business since certain changes have occurred over time, for example she now has an industrial kitchen  which contributes to the atmosphere of her business.  Her desires are to have more economic resources to supply the materials needed to maintain this type of business.  She has been doing this work for her entire life and does not want to lose her business.  This way of life provides the necessary income to provide for her and her family.  Her dreams are that her tortillas continue to have the same quality and that she will have a variety of clients, since they are the reason her fame has spread for the excellent quality of her tortillas.\r\n\r\nAmong her dreams she wishes to be able to visit another country, which she only knows from pictures.  Mrs. Candida's economic activity is the production and sale of tortillas.  Her business is located in her home.  She has 40 years experience in her business, which she started on her own.  She decided to establish her own business in her home after her mother taught her the trade in order to satisfy the need of her children.  Candida offers her tortillas to her clients in the most favorable method, and as such has obtained fame with her neighbors and her clients.  In addition to selling tortillas from her home, she decided to offer them on certain streets and improve her income for her and her family, since the price was a little higher.  Now she needs financing for business capital that she needs to take advantage of the lower price of corn and maintain the raw materials needed to make tortillas. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Jung, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":260551,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Business Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-25T17:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Candida Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1090.91},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1090.91},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1090.91},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1090.91},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1090.91},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1090.91},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1090.91},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1090.91},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1090.91},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1090.91},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1090.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":1090.91,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1099.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400005},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":1090.91,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1099.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092003},{"amount":54.54,"local_amount":1090.91,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1099.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985386},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":1090.91,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:10:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1099.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446002},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":1090.91,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1099.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956643},{"amount":54.56,"local_amount":1090.91,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:59:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1099.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174068},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":1090.91,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:29:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1099.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599693},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":1090.91,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:57:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1099.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035586},{"amount":54.55,"local_amount":1090.91,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:39:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1099.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947995},{"amount":109.05,"local_amount":2181.81,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2198.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680667}],"funded_date":"2009-01-25T19:37:02Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T13:32:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Gilchrest","image":158677}},{"id":89656,"name":"Seng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Seng T., 55, is the mother of two married children.

They both utilize their money to pay the utilities and also to save money for a rainy day.\r\n\r\nSeeing their dedication towards their work, their elder daughter has started paying attention to her mother\u2019s work. Therefore, Firdous has applied for a loan from Asasah because she wants to buy a sewing machine for her daughter who is able to work on her own. In this way, Firdos can earn more income and able to fulfill more orders in less time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":565761,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase another sewing machine for her sewing business that her daughter will use","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Lahore","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"31.549722 74.343611","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2010-07-08T19:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Firdous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2010-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3181.82},{"due_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3181.8}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.63},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:38:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166799493},{"amount":38.63,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:41:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172068994},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2010-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T12:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177360083},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:59:21Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182494762},{"amount":38.63,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188629671},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:34:01Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191372603},{"amount":38.63,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191372604},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:13:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201231840},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206098286},{"amount":38.63,"local_amount":3181.82,"processed_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211168688},{"amount":38.64,"local_amount":3181.8,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:35:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3307.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211168689}],"funded_date":"2010-07-09T00:53:54Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:35:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":217512,"name":"Rodello","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rodello D. is from the village of Hasaan, Lopez Jaena, Misamis Occidental.

The members have known each other for many years.  The following is a description of the different occupations that they work in: Se\u00f1orita Santos Cristina L. R. works in sales.  Santos owns a general store, a bicycle parts shop, and a mill.  She has been in this business for over 8 years and thanks to the financial support that has been offered to her, Santos has taken full advantage of it and has watched her business grow significantly, since it is one of the best stocked shops in the area.  \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1or Santos Julian L. R. also works in sales and industrials.  He works in the sale of basic grains and the elaboration and sale of wood furniture, a sector that he has worked in for over 7 uninterrupted years.  In the village, there wasn't electricity and he had to do all of his work manually, which was very time consuming.  Now, with electrical installation, Santos Juli\u00e1n wants to purchase electric machinery in order to make his carpentry work easier.  \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1orita Nohemi del Carmen R. works in sales.  Nohemi owns a small general store where she sells popular consumption products for over 4 years.  There aren't many similar businesses in her area which allows her to have a permanent and steady flow of regular customers.  Her business has been growing little by little thanks to good administration.  \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1orita Karen Yesenia O. works in sales as well.

Over this time, big changes happened in her life. In the past, Munira had no house of her own. Since she started her business, by putting aside a fraction of the profits, Munira was able to buy a parcel of land and begin a house construction. Munira, 35 is married and has 3 children. Her husband has no permanent job and puts all his efforts to help her wife in her challenging business. Munira buys dried apricots and pit. She and her family then sort the purchases and re-sell them based on the sorted grades. With help of MicroInvest loans, Munira significantly increased the asset value of her business. Following Munira\u2019s advice, many other women, who sell dried fruits, became MicroInvest borrowers. Now, Munira asks for a new loan to purchase dried fruits.<p><b>Translated from Russian by Aleksandr Zhuk, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\u0411\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 2 \u043b\u0435\u0442

Pemuda 23 tahun ini berharap bisa diberi bantuan modal, sehingga nantinya dia bisa membeli barang bekas kemudian menjualnya lagi, tidak hanya mencari seperti yang dia lakukan sekarang."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":161015,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Waste Management","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To increase business capital (Menambah Modal Usaha)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Badung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.5 115.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-05-17T22:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Suhir","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-31T23:34:19Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-06-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":231231.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":242260},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-07-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:59Z","rounded_local_amount":231231.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":271296},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-08-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:55Z","rounded_local_amount":231231.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":300522},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-09-19T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-26T07:13:38Z","rounded_local_amount":231231.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331211},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-10-19T09:00:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":231231.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":365282}],"funded_date":"2008-05-17T23:34:19Z","paid_date":"2008-11-16T08:39:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":52789,"name":"Gulijon","description":{"languages":["ru"],"texts":{"ru":"Gulijon H. lives in the Vakhsh region.
