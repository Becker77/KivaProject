Ella vende flores y comida r\u00e1pida, como sopaipillas, hot dogs, s\u00e1ndwiches y empanadas, en un carrito frente al cementerio. Estas actividades las desarrolla hace 23 a\u00f1os, pero en esa ubicaci\u00f3n trabaja hace 10 a\u00f1os. \nSu familia, es decir sus 3 hijas y sus yernos, tambi\u00e9n venden sus productos en ese mismo sector. Sus hijas tambi\u00e9n trabajan con Fondo Esperanza y sus negocios consisten en la venta de confites, helados y mote con huesillo.  \nCon este pr\u00e9stamo Judith quiere comprar una m\u00e1quina congeladora, para guardar sus productos comestibles. Su meta es apoyar y motivar a sus hijas para que crezcan en sus negocios y as\u00ed puedan tener una mejor calidad de vida. \nDurante la tragedia del terremoto del pasado 27 de febrero, Judith perdi\u00f3 toda su mercader\u00eda, y afortunadamente su casa no tuvo da\u00f1os. Ella est\u00e1 muy agradecida del apoyo que les dio Fondo Esperanza, haci\u00e9ndose presente con ollas comunes (repartiendo comida a los emprendedores afectados) y tomando medidas de emergencia con respecto a los pagos de los pr\u00e9stamos. Judith ha sentido tambi\u00e9n un gran apoyo de parte de Fondo Esperanza, en relaci\u00f3n a su negocio y a los de sus hijas, ya que gracias a los cr\u00e9ditos y la educaci\u00f3n, sus negocios han podido crecer. \nConcepci\u00f3n, est\u00e1 asentada en la desembocadura del r\u00edo Biob\u00edo, uno de los m\u00e1s grandes del pa\u00eds, al sur de Chile, en la regi\u00f3n del B\u00edob\u00edo. Ha tenido una importante funci\u00f3n en nuestra historia, siendo sede de importantes batallas y asentamiento relevante, especialmente durante la Guerra de Arauco, por estar en la frontera con territorio mapuche. Actualmente la ciudad posee un importante desarrollo econ\u00f3mico y demogr\u00e1fico, llegando a ser considerada como uno de los n\u00facleos urbanos, demogr\u00e1fico, administrativo, financiero y comercial m\u00e1s relevantes de Chile, despu\u00e9s de Santiago y Valpara\u00edso.\n\n","en":"Judith is part of the \u201cPrieto Cruz\u201d communal bank, in the city of Concepci\u00f3n. She sells flowers and fast food such as sopaipillas (deepfried pumpkin pastries), hot dogs, sandwiches and empanadas, from a stall in front of the cemetery. She has developed these activities over 23 years, although she has been in this location for 10 years. \r\n\r\nHer family - which is to say her three daughters and their children, also sell products in the same sector. Her daughters also work with [the field partner] Fondo Esperanza, and their businesses consist of selling sweets, icecreams, and mote con huesillo (a sweet drink \/ dessert made with peaches). With this loan, Judith wants to buy a freezer, to store her perishable foods. Her goal is to support and motivate her daughters in their businesses, so that they can grow and improve their quality of life. \r\n\r\nIn the terrible earthquake that happened on 27th February, Judith lost all her stock, though fortunately her house was not damaged. She is very grateful for the support Fondo Esperanza has given them, being there with communal cooking pots (sharing food among businesspeople affected), and putting in place emergency measures in respect of loan repayments. Judith has also had great support from Fondo Esperanza in relation to her business and those of her daughters, as it is thanks to their loans and training that their businesses have been able to grow. \r\n\r\nConcepci\u00f3n sits at the mouth of the R\u00edo Biob\u00edo, one of the largest rivers in the country, in the south of Chile. It has played an important part in our history, being the site of important battles and settlements, especially duiring the Arauco War, thanks to its location on the edge of mapuche territory. Today the city is economically and demographically important. It is starting to be considered as one of the most important urban centres in Chile - in administrative, financial, and comercial terms - after Santiago and Valpara\u00edso.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":624406,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Freezer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Concepci\u00f3n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2010-10-26T16:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judith ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":351217,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":19653},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":21103},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":21242},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":21382},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":21523},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":21664},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":21807},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":21950},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":22095},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":22240},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":22386},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":22534},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":22682},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":22831},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":22981},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23144}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.57},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.85},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.14},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.43},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.72},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.01},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.31},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.61},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.91},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.21},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.52},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.82},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.13},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.43},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":84.13,"local_amount":40756,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":40773.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177404251},{"amount":222.15,"local_amount":107618,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:00:36Z","rounded_local_amount":107665.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182542683},{"amount":183.04,"local_amount":88671,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:04:57Z","rounded_local_amount":88709.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188679419},{"amount":187.9,"local_amount":91028,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:22:09Z","rounded_local_amount":91067.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191420853},{"amount":47.78,"local_amount":23144,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":23154.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195839680}],"funded_date":"2010-10-26T18:29:28Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:38:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosa Oswald","image":null}},{"id":245568,"name":"Dinay Onyango","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dinah Anyango is 59 years old and from the from Sondu area.

lives in Dugayung, Amulung, together with his wife and three children. As head of the family, he raises crops to generate income. He goes in to the field every day, either sunny or rainy day season. He plants and harvests rice twice a year in May and November. He sells to traders in the village. He usually earns about 30,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) each crop season. According to him, his profits are not enough to sustain his family and educate his children.\r\n\r\nMagno needs to produce an abundant harvest to earn more income.

She has acquired numerous income-generating assets, including farm machines. She keeps dairy cattle and grows subsistence and commercial crops, such as maize. She takes pride in being independent and being involved in farming.\n\nLilian is seeking a loan to buy farm implements such as modern farming tools and seeds. Her operations are growing consistently, hence the need to buy modern farming implements so that she can be reliable.\nThe additional income from the increased production will enable her to repay the loan, buy food for her family, and pay fees for her children.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The loan funds will be used to purchase merchandise and improve her store.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Lucas, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":352312,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase inventory.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-15T04:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":206.82},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":210.76},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":218.39},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":229.09},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":232.05},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":247.47},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":251.93},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":261.04},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":274.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":280.43},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":291.27},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":296.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.94},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.8},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.36},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.35},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.49},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.98},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.01},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.52},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.48},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.09},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":68.94,"local_amount":206.82,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:42Z","rounded_local_amount":209.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63212004},{"amount":72.46,"local_amount":217.37,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:30:13Z","rounded_local_amount":220.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641539},{"amount":73.89,"local_amount":221.68,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":225.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080979},{"amount":75.55,"local_amount":226.65,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:18:28Z","rounded_local_amount":230.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997118},{"amount":79.12,"local_amount":237.37,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":240.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842472},{"amount":451.11,"local_amount":1353.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1373.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734045},{"amount":82.51,"local_amount":247.52,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:59Z","rounded_local_amount":251.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144750984},{"amount":96.42,"local_amount":289.26,"processed_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":293.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933634}],"funded_date":"2009-07-26T16:58:40Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Scott Lucas","image":133535}},{"id":125904,"name":"Earn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Earn Y. is 42 years old and is married.

Sem lives in Naiotel, Taebenu Sub District- Kupang District. It is situated about 30 km from and takes about three hours from Kupang City by motorbike. The road to the village is bumpy and has not been asphalted; it is still stony so it is hard for public transport such as minivans to enter the village. In order to reach the village, people usually use motorbikes or trucks. Naiotel is a remote village; there are no local markets or education and health facilities available in this village. If a family member is sick then they bring him\/her to the local clinic which is situated about 5 km from their village.    \r\n\r\nOnly 40 households live in Naiotel Village. Most people in the village have backgrounds as farmers but they usually face difficulty in the dry season as the weather is hot and they have to fetch water from the river which is about 1 km from their houses. \r\n\r\nIn the rainy season, the community is keen to cultivate vegetables, peanuts, corn and produce coconut oil. They usually sell the agricultural produce in Tunbaun Market (about 22 km from the village) and Oeba Market in Kupang City (about 30 km). They take motorcycle taxis to bring their produce to the market. It costs IDR 30,000 per return trip. In the dry season they can not sell the produce as the farm is dry; they can not plant vegetables, peanuts and corn. In order to finance the family's daily needs, the community usually digs manganese every day to be sold. The price is IDR 1,100\/kg.\r\n\r\nSem is a married man and a father of 6 children.

She could not continue to high school as Sem was unable to finance her education.\r\n-\tJermi in the Second Grade of Senior High School, Sem\u2019s brother helped Jermi so he could continue to High School.\r\n-\tYanti in the Second Grade of Junior High School\r\n-\tYeti in the Third Grade of Elementary School\r\n-\tYona is 3 years old, not at school yet.\r\n-\tDina is 1 year old, not at school yet.       \r\n\r\nSem realizes that he has to find another option to improve his family's life so that he is able to meet his children's education fees and their daily needs. He heard about TLM's cattle fattening program from the field officer. He is interested in joining the program. Together with other farmers who are also interested in joining the program, they formed a group in order to receive loans to buy cattle to be fattened over 12 month period.  Sem is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 3,400,000 from TLM to buy young cattle. The other group members of Tnaomat B1 are also requesting a loan to buy young cattle.

Julia is 24, and Fanny is 20.  They all work together in her own house.\r\n\r\nOver nine years ago she set up her own childcare center called Susperitos.  This has been her main source of income.  She starts very early taking care of the children that the mothers leave in Felicita\u2019s care.  During the day she educates the children until the time when their mothers arrive to pick them up.\r\n\r\nHer biggest desire is to make the children more comfortable.  She also wants to provide them with more games so that their time in childcare is very beneficial and will stimulate their learning.  At times her daughter helps her with this work.  \r\n\r\nThat is why she is learning to be an early childhood education teacher.  Felicita feels very well advised by her daughter.  Soon she wants to expand her childcare so that the little ones will be more comfortable.\r\n\r\nThis is her fourth loan with MFP.  She has always been punctual with her payments.  She wishes to use the loan to buy artificial grass for her nursery school.  She also wants to buy games like swings and slides.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":530885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Child Care","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Buy articial grass, games, and swings for the children","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-29T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":111},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":112}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.62},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.62},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.63,"local_amount":111,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":118.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751996},{"amount":41.62,"local_amount":111,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:57Z","rounded_local_amount":118.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934452},{"amount":41.63,"local_amount":111,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":118.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673220},{"amount":41.62,"local_amount":111,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":118.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887047},{"amount":41.63,"local_amount":111,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:22Z","rounded_local_amount":118.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154062},{"amount":41.62,"local_amount":111,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":118.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449336},{"amount":41.63,"local_amount":111,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:26Z","rounded_local_amount":118.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588068},{"amount":41.62,"local_amount":111,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:27Z","rounded_local_amount":118.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724684},{"amount":42,"local_amount":112,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:48Z","rounded_local_amount":119.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191462899}],"funded_date":"2010-04-29T17:29:38Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":200510,"name":"Kostyantin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Konstantin is married, has two children, and owns a shoe store at Jubilee Market in the town of Zaporozhye.

Pero consiente de su limitaci\u00f3n; siembra tambi\u00e9n en sociedad con otras personas que tienen mayores terrenos agr\u00edcolas. Ya tiene 7 a\u00f1os de experiencia, en todo este tiempo obtuvo buenas ganancias, pues comercializa en el mercado de frutas de la capital del pa\u00eds, donde viaja constantemente. \u201cEl secreto es saber negociar las cargas de frutas\u201d, afirma. Su principal dificultad, es la falta de terrenos amplios para poder sembrar en mayores cantidades, limit\u00e1ndose a asociarse con terceros.

They have a son named Tomy who they care for and provide an education.  Judith has her own home in the town of Perene, which is in the central Peruvian jungle.  In the community of Manankiari, she has a hectare of farmland on which she grows bananas, guavas, tangelos, and oranges.  However, she is aware of her limitations.  She also works for other people who have larger plots of land.  Judith has seven years of experience.  Throughout this time, she has generated good earnings by traveling constantly to the fruit market in the national capital to sell her goods.  \u201cThe secret is to know how to negotiate for loads of fruit,\u201d Judith says.  Her main difficulty is not having enough land to grow in large quantities, which is why she relies on other people.  For this reason, she is accumulating money to invest in the purchase of more farmland.  Now she is preparing for the tangelo harvest that takes place in April.  \r\n<p>\r\nJudith is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cLos So\u00f1adores\u201d (The Dreamers) and receiving her fourth loan from MFP.  She is grateful for all the support she has received from her Communal Bank.  Judith is always hiring workers to help with clearing her fields.  For this reason, she will use this loan to pay the weekly salary of the workers who help her.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as <i>tontines<\/i>. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the <i>tontines<\/i> provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional <i>tontines<\/i> from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and has restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":729423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of agricultural products (millet, yams, peanuts, etc.) and transportation to market for retail sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Ker Gu Mag","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lamo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":null,"disbursal_currency":null,"disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":null,"repayment_term":null,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[],"scheduled_payments":[],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11208,"name":"Felicia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Felicia C. has raised seven children, who then gave her 20 grandchildren who in turn have given her 17 great-grandchildren.

After graduation, she began to work as a school teacher. Gradually, Dilrabo climbed the career ladder and now she works as the school\u2019s principle. The school is located in a small village of Shurab. Dilrabo loves her work and enjoys teaching. However, a schoolteacher\u2019s pay is not enough to sustain oneself, and Dilrabo must do something in addition to her work in school. To earn extra income, Dilrabo and her entire family breed cattle. When Dilrabo learned of MicroInvest, she came for an appointment and liked the loan conditions. Dilrabo took a loan and bought several rams. According to Dilrabo, the purchase brought additional income into her family\u2019s budget. Now, she asks for a new loan to purchase more rams."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":52024,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To expand the number of cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Isfara","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.116667 70.633333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2007-08-15T06:05:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dilrabo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-08-29T23:21:28Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":650,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2007-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2007-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2007-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":72.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.22},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":72.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":73,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2007-09-15T09:19:04Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":54956},{"amount":73,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2007-10-15T09:18:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":67724},{"amount":73,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2007-11-15T10:20:28Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":81866},{"amount":73,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2007-12-15T10:20:18Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97458},{"amount":73,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2008-01-15T09:40:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":115787},{"amount":73,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2008-02-15T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":135706},{"amount":73,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2008-03-15T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":158321},{"amount":73,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2008-04-15T08:17:16Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182713},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2008-05-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:23:26Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":210515}],"funded_date":"2007-08-15T23:21:28Z","paid_date":"2008-05-15T09:03:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":19400,"name":"Sergio","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Sergio is a married man, has four children, and his wife is a homemaker.

Since 1993, he has operated a shoemaking shop in the city of Lom\u00e9 where he purchases, on-site, everything that he needs to make shoes. He takes orders and also sells his shoes at expositions. His shoes are in high demand, but due to his insufficient working capital, he is unable to meet customer demand.

Hasan is a farmer who has been working the land for the past seven years. He is 48 years old, married and has five children (there are six people in his household, including his five children and wife). He was educated through secondary school and had some formal training in farming. This has done the trick for him financially. In the upcoming season, Hasan plans to grow wheat, onions and carrots. This will require more money than he has, so he is requesting a loan of 3000 somoni to buy seeds and fertilizer for a successful harvest. The income will allow Hasan to take better care of his children's health, nourishment and schooling. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International:<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its epic mountain passes and its rich history which includes its place as a key post along the Silk Road and events at the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 48 years old and the group leader of a six-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. Sherlita is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, She raises pigs for fattening and sale. Sherlita has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 10000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sherlita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 17000 PHP from ASKI which was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies and is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP also to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the eighth loan taken out by Sherlita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Group Loan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"You may not think that selling yellow bananas in a country where bananas grow everywhere and cost next to nothing would be a wise business decision, but then you have never seen the sight along the one of a kind roadside venue on the main road from Kenya to Kampala where Nanono is in competition with a least three dozen other women who sell only one thing to passerbys: yellow bananas.\r\n<p>\r\nHere\u2019s what happens. There is a constant stream of van taxis each carrying 14 passengers on this very busy and dangerous road. They all stop at this roadside pullover (the driver gets a free bunch of bananas for doing this). Immediately upon stopping, dozens of women attack the van with bunches of ripened bananas. They swarm around every window. The conductor, the man next to the sliding side door, opens it and bunches of banana are pressed into your face. You can buy a ripen bunch, say 14-20 in a bunch for 30 cents. The driver stops long enough to get his free bunch and enough for anyone to buy and off we go again down the road as the ladies back off and wait for the next taxi.\r\n<p>\r\nNow get this, Nanono who is 35, single with 6 children and cares for 4 orphans has been doing this for 15 years, supporting her family. She is the chairperson of the Najjembe Lending Group of which she has been a member for the past 7 years. Her portion of the loan will be about $175.00 which she will use to pay school fees for her children.\r\n<p>\r\nOne side note regarding this group. Loans are disbursed to the group. Although there is not a lot of crime, the time of the loan disbursements can be risky due to the money involved. I asked the group if we could go outside to take the photo and I was told that they were afraid due to the fact that there had been a hold-up a couple of months earlier with another group loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":97843,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Nanono plans to use her portion of the group loan to pay her children's school fees.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Lugazi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.377222 32.919722","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2007-12-18T09:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":5000,"lender_count":157,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nanono","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fazira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hajanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Prossy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cissy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mayeni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anninah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Muwajjuma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esseza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Faiazia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harriet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jalyci","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Miroro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nambi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nakanbira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manford","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Byaniko","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaliya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-01T22:44:07Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":8500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":5000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2125000},{"due_date":"2008-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2125000},{"due_date":"2008-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2125000},{"due_date":"2008-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1250,"local_amount":2125000,"processed_date":"2008-02-02T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2131250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":126898},{"amount":1250,"local_amount":2125000,"processed_date":"2008-03-02T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2131250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":147571},{"amount":1250,"local_amount":2125000,"processed_date":"2008-04-02T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2131250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":171895},{"amount":1250,"local_amount":2125000,"processed_date":"2008-05-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-02T09:30:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2131250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":199136}],"funded_date":"2007-12-18T22:44:07Z","paid_date":"2008-05-02T09:12:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":31705,"name":"Komlan","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"<p>Mr. Kp\u00e9nou Komlan is 38 years old, married, and has four (04) children who are in school.

Abdukodir has a great experience in the field of animal husbandry because since his young years he was helping his father to shepherd the cattle. Abdukodir's sons also help him.

N. lives in the village of Pasil, Brgy. Tagda, Hinigaran Negros Occidental. She is 45 years old, married to Felomino N. who helps in running their businesses, and is blessed to have four young adult children. The youngest is 19 years old and the oldest is 26, and all of them help in the business for which Florigen pays them compensation. \r\n\r\nBecause of her desire to help her husband support their family, Florigen joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access capital that no one would have loaned to her without any collateral. When she received her first loan, she invested it by starting a mobile fish business. She would go from town to town selling fish during the town's market day, and she reinvested most of her income back into the business to gradually increase her stock volume. She used some of the income to send her children to school, but when they graduated from High School, they did not want to go to college and instead started helping with the business. With more helpers in her business, she expanded her operations to include selling dried fish, buying stocks from other suppliers. If any of her fresh fish stock was not sold, she sun dried them also so they wouldn't spoil, and would still earn a profit. \r\n\r\nBecause of her good customer service, she was able to develop a good relationship with a regular customer who orders dried fish in bulk from her, and she now regularly sends a box of dried fish to Manila twice a week. Aside from her fresh and dried fish business, she also sells different varieties of bananas, and also has a pig fattening venture. From these different business activities, she earns PHP 10,000 a month net income and it helps pay for the household expenses, with some left over for reinvestment in the business and savings.  \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 29,000 was used as working capital for her businesses. She was able to pay her loan on time without any delays. This contributed to her good credit performance as a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon, and she was able to access a bigger loan for her next cycle. Now she is borrowing for her 16th cycle PHP 35,000 to add to her capital in the mobile fish store and pig fattening business, so that she can provide a better future of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women.

She earns her living by operating a sari-sari (general) store and a tricycle business. She has two children who are 22 and 26 years old. Amada joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 21 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amada has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 22nd loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 to use as funds for her business operation so that she can continue to save up for the future, house repair and household expenses. Amada is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The bank meetings take place every thirty days at Cusco\u2019s Asociaci\u00f3n Arariwa\u2019s central offices.  Most of the members live in different districts of the city of Cusco.  Cusco is one of our country\u2019s most visited cities.  Cusco has infinity of tourist attractions nearby that have enchanted the entire world.  One of the main ones is Sacsayhuam\u00e1n that has 300 meter long walls made from stones that can be up to 5 meters tall and weigh 350 tons.\r\n\r\nThe members are people who are proud to live in Cusco and they take advantage of the opportunities to get ahead and to provide a better future for their children through their own efforts.   The economic activities which some of the members are involved in are:  jora (corn based typical beverage) sales, food sales, crafts sales, clothing and food sales; some are service providers.\r\n\r\nGeorgina was born in Cusco; she\u2019s 40 years old.  She lives with her spouse and two children in Cusco.  Her main economic activity is crafts sales.  She weaves such items as sweaters, blankets and other things.  Sometimes if her orders are very big she buys blankets.  On this occasion, Georgina needs the loan, as do her fellow members, to increase business capital; she wants to buy wool and crafts.\r\n\r\n(The missing members of the photo requested permission to be absent from the meeting.)\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":741819,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Knitting","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":" to buy wool and crafts.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2011-04-02T19:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Georgina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Alejandro","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gregoria Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":" Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Basilio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santa Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Whashington Albert","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5450,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1285.18},{"due_date":"2011-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1336.11},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1389.14},{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1439.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":459.84},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":478.05},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":497.03},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":515.08}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":459.84,"local_amount":1285.18,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:16:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1293.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206102621},{"amount":478.05,"local_amount":1336.11,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:37:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1344.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211172778},{"amount":497.03,"local_amount":1389.14,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1397.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216455355},{"amount":515.08,"local_amount":1439.57,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1448.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221619005}],"funded_date":"2011-04-03T04:35:33Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:21:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":290691,"name":"Altantsetseg","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Altantsetseg is 41 years old and lives with her husband and only daughter in a house in Songinohairhan district, Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

He is married and is the father of 2 boys, the oldest of which is 9 and the youngest, 6. Only his oldest son goes to school as in Mozambique children don't start going to school until they are 7 years old.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 1999 Julio and his family moved to Boane in the province of Maputo, looking for work and to better their quality of life. Initially, Julio worked as a traveling salesman, but in 2001 he decided to open his own stall in front of the main market in Boane. Julio sells various products such as household utensils and some clothes. His most popular products are plates (which he sells at 25 MZN each), spoons (which he sells at 10 MZN each) and drinking glasses (which he sells at between 12.5 MZN and 20 MZN). Julio goes to the capital of Maputo by bus twice a week to buy products. He earns between 300 MZN and 1,000 MZN a week, depending on the season and how much it rains. He earns around 7,800 MZN a month but has not yet managed to start saving any money as he has re-invested everything in his stall.<p>\r\n\r\nThis will be his first loan with Hluvuku and with Kiva. Prior to this, Julio had a loan of 6,900 MZN from another microcredit institution named Pro-Credit. He used this money to expand his stall. Julio heard of Hluvuku from friends and chose to ask for a loan as Hluvuku is nearer his place of work.<p>\r\n\r\nJulio intends to grow and expand his commercial activities and one day build his own fixed store within the market.<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Translated from Portuguese by In\u00eas Teles, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nJulio tem 29 anos e \u00e9 natural de Manjacaze na prov\u00edncia de Gaza. Julio \u00e9  casado maritalmente e pai de 2 filhos, o mais velho tem 9 anos e o segundo tem 6 anos. Somente o primeiro estuda, dado que a idade inicial de estudo em Mo\u00e7ambique \u00e9 7 anos de idade.  <p>\r\n\r\nEm 1999 Julio e sua fam\u00edlia se mudaram para Boane na prov\u00edncia de Maputo a procura de melhores condi\u00e7\u00f5es de vida, isto \u00e9, de trabalho. Inicialmente Julio trabalhava como vendedor ambulante, mas em 2001 decidiu ter sua pr\u00f3pria banca na frente do mercado central de Boane. Julio vende produtos diversos como utens\u00edlios dom\u00e9sticos e algumas roupas. Os produtos mais vendidos s\u00e3o os pratos (vende a MTn 25 cada), colheres (vende a MTn 10 cada) e copos, que s\u00e3o vendidos entre MTn 12.5 e MTn 20. Julio vai 2 vezes por semana a capital Maputo para comprar produtos, utilizando-se dos mini-\u00f4nibus p\u00fablicos. Julio tem um rendimento semanal entre MTn 300 e MTn 1,000, dependente muito da esta\u00e7\u00e3o do ano e das chuvas. Por m\u00eas consegue aproximadamente MTn 7,800, mas por enquanto n\u00e3o consegue poupar porque tem investido tudo o que sobra na pr\u00f3pria banca.<p>\r\n\r\nEste ser\u00e1 o primeiro empr\u00e9stimo de Julio na Hluvuku e com o Kiva. No passado Julio teve um empr\u00e9stimo de outra institui\u00e7\u00e3o de microfinan\u00e7as chamada Pro-Credit, no valor de MTn 6,900. Este dinheiro foi usado para a amplia\u00e7\u00e3o de sua banca. Julio ouviu falar da Hluvuku por amigos e optou por pedir um empr\u00e9stimo por ser mais perto de onde trabalha.<p>\r\n\r\nJulio tem por objetivo crescer e ampliar sua atividade comercial, um dia construindo o seu pr\u00f3prio estabelecimento fixo dentro de um

What she most wishes is to improve her quality of life. Her business is in the sale of cosmetics; this activity is very fun and profitable given that she enjoys chatting with many of her clients to whom she sells her products. She leaves every morning very early, and with her bag full of cosmetics she begins her daily sales. What she most enjoys about her job is giving her clients advice on what cream will be best for them or what colors will make their faces gleam the most. She has been carrying out this activity for the past 3 years, and hopes to in the future be able to have a beauty shop where she will be able to offer her products more comfortably, given that what she likes the least about her job is that she has to walk all day under the glaring sun.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Emilse has continued the art but new and improved techniques she has learned.  She uses her manual technique to make hammocks, backpacks and hats, especially in a vertical weave.\r\n\r\nEmilse is a widow and the mother of seven children whose ages range from 23 to 35.  Six of them finished their secondary education and one is now studying to be a nurse.  They all live and work independently in different cities.  Emilse is a hard worker and independent and therefore wants to continue working for a long time so she can feel productive and not have to depend on her children; although they always try to help her and stay in close contact.  Her dream is to remodel her home and she is on the verge of receiving government subsidy to carry out her project.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation and her first CrediKiva loan.  She plans to use it to buy materials to make hammocks, bags and backpacks.  She takes advantage of the fact that her children live in the cities of Barranquilla, Cartagena and Bogot\u00e1 and with their help has put together a customer base for selling her products which are very popular.  This means she has constant orders and also keeps an inventory of her merchandise to display it and take advantage of the Easter tourist season.  Since she began with the foundation she has been able to maintain her business and fill customer orders.  She's also been able to improve the house built in Bahareque y Palma which is almost finished.  \r\n\r\nHer greatest challenge is the fact that she does not have a lot of capital.  It has been hard being a single mother and having to educate seven children, a true challenge.  Meanwhile Emilse continues to grow personally and business-wise and has a profit-on-sales rate of 23%.

Currently, Nanay \u201cFlor\u201d is busy with her small business buying and selling tobacco just to earn the means of living every day. When she received a small amount of capital from ASHI, she managed to put it all into her business. For her, business is an important factor, and she does not want to be a problem for her group mates or for the center. \r\n\r\nNanay Flor came from a very poor family; she was the sixth of ten children. She was the luckiest among her siblings to attend school because of her determination. Nanay Flor believes that education can lift you from poverty, and that\u2019s why she is now a Day Care teacher who teaches the children to read and write.\r\n\r\nNanay Flor manages her obligation as a teacher and is a very good member of ASHI. She performs well in her business; when she has enough capital, she adds more business in order to gain more income. She hopes to share this with her children and grandchildren. \r\n\r\nNanay Flor got married at the age of 19, a marriage arranged by her parents. She did not want to marry, but she had no choice but to accept it in respect to her parents. Nanay Flor strives very hard so that what she experienced will not be experienced by her children and grandchildren in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":231071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products

He is 31 years old, is single and the father of a 5-year old. He went to school until the 12th grade but didn't graduate due to lack of financial resources. He lives in his mother's house and supports two nephews who live with them.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2006, he left Maputo to neighboring South Africa to look for a job and returned home later. He found a job as a driver for a company in Boane. He learned to drive 8 years ago at a driving school in Maputo. He works from 7:30am to 3:30pm. Besides his salary, he has his own business where he sells beer, sodas and other products. His business makes 500.00mt a day which goes towards house expenses and his savings account. \r\n<p>\r\nHe has requested loans from PROCREDITO bank but decided not to continue to. He came to know about Hluvuku through a friend who is also a member. This loan, in the amount of 10.000.00mt, is his third. He intends to purchase supplies (beer, sodas, wine and others) to increase and diversify his inventory. The previous loans were for 7.000.00mt and 10.500.00mt and were used for the same purpose. \r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, he would like to go back to school and request more loans to finish his

In 2004 he purchased a car and began to provide transportation services independently. \r\n\r\nDuring the spring Rozbek plants vegetables in Buyant district. Rozbek learned to plant vegetables from his parents at a very early age. He harvests his vegetables in the autumn, and uses them both to feed his family and to sell for a profit. Rozbek saves some of the vegetables in a warehouse to sell during the spring when they will command a higher price. \r\n\r\nHis wife, Mongolhan, has been operating a cafe at a local market for nine years and has built a loyal customer base.

She grows cacao, coffee and coca leaves and sells the crops in the Peruvian city of San Francisco where she can get the best price.  There are always wholesale buyers there who will buy whatever she has to sell.  What Justina most likes about farming is protecting her crops from the plagues of insects that can destroy her crops.  She's been farming for 39 years and what she finds most difficult about farming is getting her crops to market because it's expensive to move the crops, even when a means of transporting them is available.

In the future, she hopes to improve her crops and thereby make better profits.\r\n\r\nThis is Bernicil's fourth loan with MFP.

She has a business raising chickens.  She buys the newborn chicks and sells them when they are grown.  In addition to this, she sells items made from Brazilian gold such as necklaces and earrings, because these are easily sold due to the fact that so many women buy them.  She is also very good at making g\u00fcipiles (embroidered woven dresses typical of Guatemala.)
