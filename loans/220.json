With 20 years of experience in this market, she's very much in demand and can sell several truckloads of firewood in one week.\r\n\r\nTo bolster her business, Mrs. Fatoumata turned to Kiva's partner, the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, from which she's seeking her first individual loan. With this loan, she intends to buy four truckloads of firewood in the villages surrounding Koutiala, in order to resell them at the market in Koutiala, on credit or for cash, to a clientele comprising both men and women.\r\n\r\nShe intends to turn a monthly profit of XOF 80'000 (ca US$ 150), to be used to repay the loan and contribute to the family's small expenses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Patrick Stadelmann, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":540160,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy firewood","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":166666.66,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":170121.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961547},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":85060.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699666},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:22Z","rounded_local_amount":85061,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913555},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":85060.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180715},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":85061.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476687}],"funded_date":"2010-06-06T00:58:06Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patrick Stadelmann","image":1374498}},{"id":204850,"name":"Marlyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marlyn V. is from the town of Sta.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are both responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Crispina M.\u2019s Group. \n\nTo make a living, Crispina plants and harvests corn for sell. She has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately $75 a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Crispina joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC.  \n\nCrispina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. This will be her 6th loan  from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \n\nAbout PMPC:\n\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

On occasion he hires labourers to help him at sowing and reaping time. What he likes about his work is that he is always in the open air and can use his time as he sees fit.

She buys meat and processes it to produce products such as tocino (cured pork), giniling (ground pork), and longganisa (sweet sausage), which she sells to the community. She has many patrons who buy her processed meat and then sell it at their market stalls. There are many patrons who prefer Gemma\u2019s products since they are assured of freshness and cleanliness. Gemma's regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 1000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a loan of 18,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy meat and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGemma hopes that her business will continue to be successful, just as she fervently hopes that her children will be able to graduate one day. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Her husband works as a farmer and is able to earn ST 200 (USD 80) per week from selling his taro and banana crops.  When Lauiula heard about SPBD from a friend, she joined because she was certain that with access to capital she could greatly increase her family\u2019s income.  Lauiula used initial loans to re-stock her parent\u2019s old village store that was no longer in operation.  She re-opened it and now with the upgrades she was able to do, she can bring in up to ST 700 a week (approximately USD 280).  With access to loan funds, Lauiula has more than quadrupled her family\u2019s income.  With this track record, she is certainly an SPBD success story.  Much of Lauiula\u2019s recent profit has been reinvested in her husband\u2019s business so that the plantation can be upgraded and the income potential of their land increased.

This project has changed her family's economic situation. Currently, in her spare time she also babysits children for additional income. In addition to their retirement pensions, she and her husband make an additional 120 USD per month from raising poultry and babysitting.

She lives with her husband and her three school-aged children who inspire her to move forward.  For the last 11 years she has sold prepared meals at a location away from her home which she established  for this purpose.  She also bakes and sells bread and raises poultry.  Mayte is a very active woman and plans out her time for her various commercial activities though she also can count on her husband's and her children's support.  It is very important to her that her meals are well prepared and tasty and that her customers are well-served as well as that her poultry is adequately cared for.  What is best about her business is that both with the meals and the bread production she makes daily profits with which she is able to pay for the family's basic needs; on the other hand, the sale of her poultry happens every 35 days which is the time it takes for the chicks to mature enough to be ready for sale.  She has four loans with MFP and likes working with her communal bank because of the support, respect and responsibility that exists among its members.

The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

La coca en su estado natural es muy apreciada en Bolivia desde tiempos incaicos por sus beneficios medicinales, lo utilizan en mates para el dolor de est\u00f3mago, en cremas para dolores musculares, y las personas que tienen un trabajo que requiera un mayor esfuerzo fisico, como los mineros, mastican las hojas ya que \u00e9stas quitan el sue\u00f1o y el hambre. La cliente compra la coca que traen de los Yungas del departamento de La Paz, toda esta mercader\u00eda llega al mercado de la coca ubicado en la zona de Villa Fatima, se registra a los propietarios y luego la venden, las personas que comercian con la coca deben tener un permiso especial para vender este producto. La sra. Lady tiene su permiso ya que su pap\u00e1 es yungue\u00f1o, y le permitieron trabajar en este rubro. Es una cliente muy responsable, su esposo es chofer asalariado, ambos se apoyan para los gastos de la casa. El cr\u00e9dito que solicita ahora es para incrementar la cantidad de takes de coca ya que para fin de a\u00f1o algunos comerciantes descansan y no traen coca para vender, por esto el take de coca sube de precio. \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSi deceas conocer mas sobre la hoja milenaria visita la siguiente pagina http:\/\/www.bolivianet.com\/cultura\/encuentro\/coca\/la_coca.html\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","en":"Lady works selling coca leaves by the <i>take<\/i>. A <i>take<\/i> is a measurement used by coca sellers and is equivalent to 50 pounds. Coca in its natural state has been valued in Bolivia since Incan times for its medicinal benefits. It is used in teas for stomachache and in creams for muscle pain. People who have jobs that require great physical exertion, such as miners, chew the leaves because they relieve fatigue and hunger.\r\n\r\nThe borrower buys coca brought from the Yungas region in the department of La Paz. All of the merchandise arrives at the coca market located in the Villa Fatima area. The owners are registered, and then they can sell it. The people who work in the coca business must have a special permit to sell this product. Lady has a permit because her father is from the Yungas region and so they have allowed her to work in this sector. She is a very responsible borrower. Her husband is a salaried driver and they both count on one another for household expenses. The loan she is asking for now is to increase the number of <i>takes<\/i> of coca, because towards the end of the year some merchants take a break and do not bring coca to sell. For this reason the price of a <i>take<\/i> of coca goes up.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to know more about the coca leaf visit the following page:

This community is noted for being a mountainous zone and for being very near the northern border of our country. Its main economic activities are ranching and agriculture, specifically growing basic grains, sugar cane and oranges. \r\n\r\nMaureen's business is producing milk and all of the products derived from it. Some neighbors report that the cheese she sells is the best in the area. However, the amount of product she offers has declined a little due to her infrastructure. \r\n\r\nFor this reason, Maureen is requesting a loan of \u00a2604,000 (six hundred four thousand colones) to build a new enclosure where she can milk her cows under a roof, and thus ensure that she can continue offering her products to the community. \r\n\r\nShe is a member of the Manantial de Santa Fe communal bank, one of the 100 partner organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be her first loan, and she is very happy because she is sure that this investment will greatly improve her business. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman,

Miranda, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: Fish vending, running a general store and food vending. Her husband Romeo G., who is 50 years old, works as a fisherman, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 14 to 29 years old. Marietta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired to achieve something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marietta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 16000 helped her to earn a monthly profit of PHP 5000,  lifting her family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 16000, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her fish vending business so that she can continue to save up for her children's education and household consumption.

Most of the farmland needs irrigation which is a challenge for farmers. A large part of land in Kyrgyzstan is used for crop cultivation, but even more of this mountainous country is used as pasture for livestock and animal husbandry. \r\n\r\nDamira B. is a 44-year-old farmer from Tokmok who is married with two sons. Her eldest son has a temporary income from his job and her younger son goes to school. The whole family relies on their land as a source of income. A basic part of their income is the sale of strawberries; they also cultivate land for other crops and raise livestock. Damira\u2019s family took a risk to start raising livestock, but it has been a good decision with good results. They have purchased new carpets for their house, replaced old linoleum, and made household repairs. The family hopes to use this loan to purchase more livestock animals for breeding.  \r\n\r\nDuishokul C. is 52 years old and also sells strawberries. Duishokul applied for this loan to purchase livestock to expand her business. She hopes that, after a while, she will be able to give her husband the car of his dreams and have a two-sided refrigerator for herself. \r\n\r\nAinura M. is 37 years old and she and her husband sell strawberries. Ainura has already begun to enjoy the fruits of her labor. She hopes to use this loan to increase the number of cattle that she has as well as purchase new furniture for her bedroom.  \r\n\r\nAigul S. is 50 years old and is engaged in the strawberry business. She plans to use this loan to buy livestock. She is sure that she will be a success, because there was a time when her business was raising cattle.\r\n\r\n \r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She also sells used clothes and travels along the river to find more income for her household. \r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about working in this activity is that she can manage her own time as sales take place on her own schedule.   She has been engaged in this activity for 4 years, and feels that it's going well for her because her earnings are doubling her investment.  Mercedes hopes to expand her business and engage in selling food on the street in front of her home, as she saw there is a very interesting market in the street where she lives. \r\n\r\nMercedes is taking her sixth loan through MFP, and expects to continue as well as she has done up until now.   She has always shown herself to be a responsible woman, and above all accomplished.   She is a beloved member of her community bank, who is always smiling and concerned with the welfare of the other members. \r\n\r\nWith the 1,000 New Soles requested, she will buy fruit, second-hand clothing, and ingredients and supplies for the sale of food so she can start this new business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":838512,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy fruit, second-hand clothing, and ingredients and supplies for selling food.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-08T15:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":150.32},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":155.38},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":163.9},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":169.02},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":177.71},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":183.67}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.37},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.27},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.46},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.38},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.64},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.37,"local_amount":150.32,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":154.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350833},{"amount":58.27,"local_amount":155.38,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:06Z","rounded_local_amount":159.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851175},{"amount":61.46,"local_amount":163.9,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:32Z","rounded_local_amount":168.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666351},{"amount":63.38,"local_amount":169.02,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:45Z","rounded_local_amount":173.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621508},{"amount":66.64,"local_amount":177.71,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":182.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835581},{"amount":68.88,"local_amount":183.67,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:54Z","rounded_local_amount":188.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245363}],"funded_date":"2011-08-21T16:58:15Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":327805,"name":"Virgen De Candelaria Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La A.C. \u201cVIRGEN DE CANDELARIA\u201d iniciar\u00e1 su primer ciclo en Pro Mujer, como parte del Centro de Copacabana, est\u00e1 compuesta por diez integrantes y est\u00e1 dirigida por una mesa directiva encabezada por la se\u00f1ora Catalina.

Comfort K. is the first in her area of the market to start selling packaging materials. She sells the typical black plastic bags that are used in commerce in Ghana, old unread newspapers from abroad for wrapping bread, plastic bags used for drinking water, and various other products used by businesses inside the market.\r\n<p>\r\nShe started her business six years ago with just $700. Over the past few years she has been able to keep her business running by buying most of her products on credit. However, lately her suppliers have been demanding money upfront, rather than allowing her to pay after she has sold the packaging materials. For the most part, she has been able to meet her suppliers\u2019 demands, but she will need a loan to purchase 17 bundles of water bags. She has no doubt that these bags will sell.

Angela is a 44-year-old married woman with four children. Additionally, another family member is dependent on her. She owns a small Mama Lishe, or local caf\u00e9, that she started in 2005 and runs with two employees. When you see a SELFINA entrepreneur whose business title is \u2018restaurant\u2019 or \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019, you may have to adjust your mental image of what that is. A local restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long, wooden benches, with the sky as a ceiling. Such places don\u2019t even appear in the Lonely Planet\u2019s budget guide, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap and tasty meal, and someone to have a chat with, this is the place to be. The food is all local; rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough, made from maize flour), plantain (a cooked savoury banana), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of yummy sauces. \r\n<p> Angela is requesting $US275 in order to purchase additional stocks of rice, cooking oil, and beans and to add more chairs for customer seating. In the future, she hopes to open another caf\u00e9, which would allow her to serve her delectable food to even more customers.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client.

She has lived a simple life, raising three children. After the children grew up and left to work she still engaged herself in doing her everyday work around the house. She keeps some cattle and manages to earn a certain amount of money by selling milk. \r\n<p>\r\nThe children have begun to make their own living. The eldest and the middle brothers are married and live separately. The youngest son, now 21, is also married. But according to Central Asian tradition, the youngest son stays with his parents to take care of them once they get old.\r\n<p>\r\nLife in the rural area has been more attractive to Zyinatkan than the life in a bustling city. The fresh air and everyday work of raising cattle have kept Zyinatkan young. She loves the way she lives and enjoys every day of her life. Now that her son is by her side and helps look after the cattle, her life is even easier. \r\n<p>\r\nSelling milk brings Zyinatkan about $70 a month. Because of this money, Zyinatkan has been able to make some repairs at home. One thing that concerns Zyinatkan is the winter season. They need coal to get through it. Zyinatkan has applied for this loan to purchase a sufficient amount of coal. \r\n\r\nZyinatkan\u2019s partners are: \r\n\r\nAinur, 45, keeps cattle and sells milk. Her husband helps Ainur around the house. They have five children: four daughters and one son. Two daughters live separately. Ainur needs a loan to prepare a dowry for their third daughter. \r\n\r\nFarida, 44, and her husband are raising four children. They keep cattle and farm. They make their living by selling milk and onions that they grew. Farida needs a loan to make a repair at her house. Her goal is to give all her children a good education.\r\n\r\nMirbek, 21, is single. He is already making his own living. He has a trailer and offers transportation services. Besides that, he raises livestock and sells milk. Mirbek needs a loan to buy fuel for sowing.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She lives in the home of a relative and desires to have a peaceful retirement.  To achieve this goal she has a business selling imported clothing.  At the moment, she sells her merchandise as a traveling vendor through the main fairs in the city of Juliaca every day of the week.  Irma is a very persuasive saleswoman and always convinces her customers to leave with some clothing.  The part of her job that she enjoys the most is conversing with her customers and providing them good advice as to what clothing they should wear.  Irma has been in business for 13 years.  The hardest and most complicated part is transporting the heavy bundles of clothing to the places where she sells.  In time, she hopes to acquire enough capital to secure a vending post at the San Jos\u00e9 Market (the largest market in the city of Juliaca), where it will be more convenient for her to sell her products.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her seventh loan with MFP.

needed to expand her home-based cosmetics business.\r\n\r\nWith her one-year old daughter by her side Jenny enjoys being her own boss. Having weathered the recent financial crisis, Jenny feels she is now in a good position to grow her business. With the knowledge she gained at ACCION USA's educational seminars Jenny plans to continue expanding her business, supporting her family, and increasing her independence. She placed her loan request well in advance of Valentine's Day, so she was ready to capitalize on this big sales opportunity.\r\n\r\nJenny was so happy working with ACCION USA that she often refers other entrepreneurial friends. Originally from Honduras, Jenny feels that she is living proof that you can achieve what you dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":485068,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more beauty products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Miami, Florida","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":131,"posted_date":"2010-02-13T13:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":750,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":81.14},{"due_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":81.68},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":82.23},{"due_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":82.77},{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":83.88},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":84.44},{"due_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":85.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.14},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.68},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.23},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.77},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.88},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.44},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.14,"local_amount":81.14,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":81.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128871925},{"amount":81.68,"local_amount":81.68,"processed_date":"2010-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:27:31Z","rounded_local_amount":81.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136602145},{"amount":82.23,"local_amount":82.23,"processed_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:28:00Z","rounded_local_amount":82.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144637612},{"amount":82.77,"local_amount":82.77,"processed_date":"2010-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T08:58:08Z","rounded_local_amount":82.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151819557},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T07:35:25Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159717023},{"amount":83.88,"local_amount":83.88,"processed_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:14:56Z","rounded_local_amount":83.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166768819},{"amount":84.44,"local_amount":84.44,"processed_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:20:19Z","rounded_local_amount":84.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172037649},{"amount":85,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2010-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T09:54:02Z","rounded_local_amount":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177328544},{"amount":85.53,"local_amount":85.53,"processed_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T11:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":85.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182463614}],"funded_date":"2010-02-15T05:07:20Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T11:33:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":180102,"name":"Emerita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emerita C. is from the village of Malinao, Gingoog city.

Davron is 50 years old. He is married and has one child. Davron is the sole breadwinner for his family and his only income comes from the raising and sale of large livestock at the local market. Every year he buys young heifers from the farms in adjacent villages. He raises them with the help of his wife and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers. \r\n\r\nDavron is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd isn't enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase additional young cattle. To do this, he needs to invest an additional 7,500 TJS in his business. In order to receive this amount, Davron has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner organization, IMON International.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Twenty-two years ago she settled in the community where she now carries out her business activities.\r\n\r\nFrancisca makes blocks.

At this time Francisca needs a loan to buy more materials, such as bags of cement. (A bag of cement costs about 23 PEN.) Francisca sometimes buys bags of cement wholesale in the city of Cusco, which is cheaper for her, and at other times she buys a few bags of cement in shops in her district so that she won't be without working materials.\r\n\r\nThe meetings of the members of the communal bank \"Virgen Asunta\" are held every month in the community of Hospitalpampa in the home of one of the members.

Since he was a boy he has grown citrus and other fruit trees, but six years ago he began cutting down trees. He now has an established clientele for whom he provides wood to be made into fruit crates. He begins working at 4:00am, when he goes deep into the forest to look for mature trees. He pays S\/20.00 (approximately US $6.50) for each tree and then sells the cut wood for S\/36.00 (approximately US $11.50). It is a very profitable enterprise, and for most of the year he completely covers his expenses. During the rainy season, however, he cannot remove the trees from the forest.

She is 39 years old and lives in her own house, with her youngest son Franz, 14. She wants to give him a better future and be able to pay for his higher studies. For 4 years Ana has been clothing people that converge at the Tupac Amaru market (an important market of Juliaca city). Her stand is one of the most visited, and she now has a large variety of garments, as many for women as gentlemen. She would like to create a bigger shop, where she could better attend to her clients and show them more clothes. She enjoys selling and talking to her clients at her stand, but what is difficult is carrying the clothes to her stand where she works, which is too tiring for her alone. Ana works very hard, and now needs money to pay for the studies of her dear son, to whom she wants to give a good life.

O. is a 48-year-old general store owner from Eastern Samar. She immigrated with her family to Maricaban, Pasay City years ago. Her husband, Fernando, 49, is a fellow business entrepreneur. Their three children are all attending school.\r\n<p>\r\nRose has been doing different businesses for the past 15 years.  Along with her general store, Rose has a meat stall in Libertad Public Market. She also cooks breakfast goodies and sells them to her neighbors. She has hired the services of an assistant to help her tend her businesses. Rose is earning 48,000 PHP a month. \r\n<p>\r\nOver the years, Rose\u2019s businesses have grown steadily. Then, a few years ago, she became afflicted with severe hypertension. Medical expenses have taken a heavy toll on their finances. She thanks God that she learned of Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative in 2006.  With the loans she received, her businesses slowly recovered. She has also recovered but has to take medications for the rest of her life.  \r\n<p>\r\nRose is now on her seventh loan cycle with the cooperative. She is in need of a loan of 20,000 PHP. She wants to venture into the business of buying and selling dried fish. Rose is thankful that she is alive and strong. She works hard, hand-in-hand with her husband, to be able to fund their children\u2019s education.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About CCT:<\/b>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response to poverty and social injustice. It is carried out through a fusion of social development initiatives and an evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context. CCT serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ. \r\n<p>\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n

42-year-old married man. Siafa has three children aged 9 to 14 years old and their educational levels are 2nd through 6th grade. He is a high school graduate but could not continue to university due to lack of financial support from his parents. Siafa lives and works in the Dualla community, north of Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. This is a very big commercial community and the majority of its inhabitants live on small and medium-sized businesses.\r\n\r\nSiafa's business is the sale of fresh fish, meat and chicken. He buys his product wholesale from fishermen, poultrymen and butchers and sells to the local residents. He has been running this business for three years and hopes to become a business investor in the future.\r\n\r\nSiafa's difficulty is the rainy season because, during this season, it can be very hard for customers to buy when it is wet. But he also gives his customers a good manner of approach and cleans his business premises in order to encourage them to always patronize his business.\r\n\r\nSiafa needs this loan in order to increase his capital so as to improve his business. He dreams of building a house for himself and his family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":402167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Sa r\u00e9putation d\u00e9passe le cadre de S\u00e9gou.\nPour faire de la teinture, elle dilue diff\u00e9rents produits de teintures modernes et traditionnels dans de l\u2019eau chaude ensuite elle trempe les tissus blancs  dans cette eau pour leur donner la couleur voulue.  Les tissus teint\u00e9s sont \u00e9tal\u00e9s sur une corde pour s\u00e9chage. Ensuite elle les am\u00e8ne chez le couturier.

She lives with her husband and children in a traditional family with several households in the first district of S\u00e9gou (4th administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  Soon after dropping out of school in 6th class (education system of Mali), she very soon started earning revenues by opting for an apprenticeship dyeing cloth.  She learned this trade from one of her sisters-in-law 15 years ago.  Today, she enjoys a lot of experience and distinction.  She has an excellent command of the ins and outs of this business sector.  Her reputation extends beyond S\u00e9gou.  \r\n\r\nTo dye cloth, she dilutes different modern and traditional dye products in hot water.  Then she soaks white fabrics in this water to give them the desired color.  The dyed fabrics are spread out on a rope to dry.  Next, she takes them to a tailor.  Once the clothing is sewn, it\u2019s washed and carefully wrapped.  \r\n\r\nWith plans to increase her business capital, to realize bigger profits, she turned toward Soro Yiriwaso.  She is on her first individual loan, which she intends to use to buy 3 bolts of damask cloth.  She supplies herself locally and in Bamako from wholesalers.  And she sells to customers composed of women and men, cash or credit accepted.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she anticipates earning a monthly profit of 40,000 francs CFA.  This will allow her to help her husband and to assist with societal events (baptisms, marriages, etc.)  Her ambition is to open a ready-to-wear clothing store. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

For over a year, he has worked in public transport in a motorcycle taxi that he managed to buy thanks to the money from his savings. Jorge works in his taxi everyday covering routes in Cayalt\u00ed and its surrounding villages. This business is the only source of family income from which he tries to stretch to its limit.

In the house lives her entire family that is comprised of 6 people: Cecilia, her huband and their four children, Cecilia works as a regular employee in a business that is dedicated to providing cleaning services to private enterprises and also to private residences.  Her husband is a master bricklayer.  There is the usual competition in their fields now that there are other people that offer the same services.  But their early beginning permits them to build on their experience, above all with their regular clientele.  The loan will be used as working capital for the husband for the purchase of building materials that he requires in some works that he prepares as finished goods.  This will be her sixth loan cycle with Agrocapital.  She has an excellent record of payment in all her other loans.  The couple are very responsible people and work together to help their family get ahead.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Barbara (B) Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":487849,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"buy building materials for her husband's bricklaying business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-02-14T03:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cecilia De","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":66.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:46Z","rounded_local_amount":66.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909443},{"amount":137.54,"local_amount":137.54,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:24Z","rounded_local_amount":137.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945019},{"amount":68.23,"local_amount":68.23,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:44Z","rounded_local_amount":68.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673351},{"amount":67.04,"local_amount":67.04,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-12T08:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":67.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144707374},{"amount":60.54,"local_amount":60.54,"processed_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-02T08:35:59Z","rounded_local_amount":60.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631279},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-24T07:56:53Z","rounded_local_amount":66.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845277},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-29T10:55:11Z","rounded_local_amount":66.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172111610},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-19T10:23:39Z","rounded_local_amount":66.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405047},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:25:41Z","rounded_local_amount":66.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182543563},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":66.67,"processed_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-21T09:24:45Z","rounded_local_amount":66.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188680364},{"amount":66.63,"local_amount":66.63,"processed_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-19T10:40:04Z","rounded_local_amount":66.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191421841}],"funded_date":"2010-02-16T22:53:07Z","paid_date":"2011-02-19T10:40:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"B Brown","image":120650}},{"id":180119,"name":"Irene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Irene D. is from the village of   Malinao ,  Gingoog City.

All of them are from the city of Chill\u00e1n.\r\n\r\nRuth is a member of the communal bank.  In the photo she\u2019s seated in the second spot from right to left wearing a brown jacket and pointing her thumb up.  She has been making costumes for the last three years.  She started out with 20 costumes and now she has 200.  She buys patterns and designs to make them and then rent or sell them.\r\n\r\nDuring the months between August and December she makes costumes because the other months orders tend to decrease so then she works doing clothing repairs and making some individual articles of clothing.  Ruth works at home; she sews and sells there.  She also comments that she has many customers especially teenagers.  She buys her merchandise in the cities of Concepci\u00f3n and Santiago.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy patterns, lace, fabric, ribbon, zippers, decorations, tulle and satin.  Her goals are to have an established locale where she can sell her costumes and party supplies.  Besides, she\u2019d like to buy an overlock sewing machine because she currently only has a straight stitch sewing machine.\r\n\r\nRuth lives with her mother and her four children who are 21, 19, 11 and 8 years old and with a 2-year-old grandson.  Her dreams on a personal level are to study clothing design specializing in wedding gowns.\r\n\r\nHer motivation to stay in business is that Ruth is the only source of family income.  Besides, it\u2019s allowed her flexibility in her schedule to be able to raise her children.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for services rendered by Fondo Esperanza because she\u2019s been able to invest in her business.  She comments that she\u2019s known the other group members for quite some time and they have a very good cooperative relationship among them.\r\n\r\nChill\u00e1n is a commune in south-central Chile.

She joined SPBD because she is focused on her family\u2019s future and knows that her husband\u2019s income alone cannot provide a future of education and opportunity for their children.  With her first loan from SPBD she set up a flea market business selling shoes, clothes and perfume.

She only studied through elementary school because her father didn't want to support her education any futher.  She stayed at home helping her mother take care of her brothers and sisters.  She has five children, three of whom depend on her economically.  Margarita has bought and sold animals for 14 years.  She started off by selling vegetables, but she abandoned this business because she didn't earn a lot of profits.  Now she buys and sells cows, pigs, and guinea pigs.  At harvest time she also buys and sells cereal and potatoes.  She has her business at her home.  With her first credit of 300 soles, which she received from the communal bank \"Mujeres Trabajadoras\" (Hard-Working Women), she invested in the purchase of vegetables to sell.  With this credit of 2,500 soles, which will be repaid in 4 months, she will invest in the purchase of a bull.  Margarita dreams about buying a taxi.

With the loan Abdusalim will purchase young cattle and construction materials for improving his cattle-shed.     \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

What she likes best about her communal bank is its education themes and the union between its partners. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lois Parshley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":477845,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy lipstick, cream, perfume, etc","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno, Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-02-14T15:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"France","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":178.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954570},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":178.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987598},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:30Z","rounded_local_amount":178.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713624},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":178.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746671}],"funded_date":"2010-02-15T05:02:17Z","paid_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lois Parshley","image":null}},{"id":180137,"name":"Runyerere Bakyara Tukwatanise Group, Kihihi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"K.

His work as a mason is exhausting, but it pays well.  Today, only two of her children live with her since they are currently in school.  The others live independently.  At one time she worked at a restaurant kitchen when her sewing business did not generate enough income, but the establishment closed down, so she resumed sewing while attending to her household chores and caring for her family.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, Maria will buy various fabrics, buttons, fringe, and zippers for making dresses to complete her orders.

She is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Bernadeth owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, and toothpaste in the local community. Bernadeth has been engaged in her business for over 8 years now.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Bernadeth joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Bernadeth has successfully repaid a previous loan from CEVI. Bernadeth is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Bernadeth from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children and improve her family's living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

She works daily from 6am to receive the milk that\u2019s delivered to her house.  Later she and her husband distribute it throughout the sector.  As for the chickens, she keeps them for a period of time of two months and then she plucks them and sells them to local stores or by the pound to local residents.\r\n\r\nShe is a founding member of the communal bank and she likes it because the installments are easy to pay as long as one works with responsibility. \r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to buy chickens to raise and to pay for the milk which is a weekly expense.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a large chicken farm in order to become a wholesaler.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":615666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To pay for the milk and to buy chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-10-14T19:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Domitila Filadelfia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:18Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407662},{"amount":137.49,"local_amount":137.49,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:31:31Z","rounded_local_amount":137.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388863},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:11:16Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188683065},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191422189},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195840967},{"amount":91.7,"local_amount":91.7,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:02:05Z","rounded_local_amount":91.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201283426}],"funded_date":"2010-10-15T16:35:15Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:02:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":241793,"name":"Loida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Loida V. is from the village of Maribucao, Gingoog City.

She is 57 years old and leads a two-member group loan made up of members of GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this group is Tanglad.\r\n\r\nElma is married, has two school-aged children and earns a living by making and selling food. She has been in this business for more than two years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month from her work.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Elma joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her life and ability to engage in business. She is applying for a loan, her first, for 5,000 PHP to buy ingredients to make products to make more food items to sell. She plans to use the additional revenue generated by her business to continue expanding it. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":651639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Recently, our client divorced and was left with three daughters to raise.  She has worked for many years in field of medicine and devoted all this time to working in a hospital.  Cholpon had to leave her work since her newborn baby requires constant care.  She spent her savings and salary (10,000 som) to buy three head of livestock.  Cholpon has begun to master a new trade: raising livestock.  After only one year of experience, Cholpon has not had trouble becoming accustomed to her new business.

The group's members sell dried fish, fresh tomatoes, garments, second hand clothes, and gruel. The women joined the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance association with the aim of boosting their business capital, and are now on their third loan. Madam Sagnini Traor\u00e9 has built a reputation in the Zambougou village for selling gruel, and aims to use her loan to purchase four bags of millet wholesale at the Konodimini market. \r\nTo make gruel, she must first husk the seeds, wash them, crush them with a mill until they form semolina which she then heats to make gruel. She differentiates herself from other gruel vendors by adding curdled milk and sugar. She takes cash and credit sales from home or via door-to-door sales around the village. Her customer base is made up of men, women and children. Madam Sagnini Traor\u00e9 aims to use the loan to generate an average monthly profit of 20,000 FCFA which will be used to reinvest in the business and to see to her family's needs.

She has one cow and some poultry which she uses for laying. With the cow, she practices zero-grazing, which means that instead of the cow grazing on grasses throughout the village, it is penned up in a small corral. Feed is then bought and fed to the cow. This method takes much less attention, is simple, and quite yielding in growth. The downside is the time it takes to sickle the grass and bring it to the cow.<p>With her loan, she plans to buy more chicks for laying. It takes several months for chicks to become layers, and money for feed has to be spent prior to getting a return, so this can be difficult since few people have the ability to save.

She requests a personal loan to make repairs to her kitchen and purchase new furniture. The money will be used to install new gas lines to her kitchen, which is crucial during the winter months when electricity is available only during specific hours of the day. With gas lines she is able to use 'balloon' gas - or canisters which can be stored for use when gas is not available from the city supply. Because of last year's winter conditions, much of Bashorat's furniture was damaged.  During periods where there was no heat in the home, the furniture became very cold.  When the heat returned, condensation formed and has warped her wooden table, chairs and other furniture.  She will use a portion of proceeds for the purchase of new furniture.\r\n\r\nBashorat plans to repay the loan over the next 12 months from her salary earned as a notary. She and her husband have a grown daughter who is married and also a son who is currently studying at the University in Khujand.

In this plantation, he faces an obstacle because his field is infertile soil. In order to deal this problem, Mrs. Theavy C. decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer and she would use the rest of money to buy piglet for breeding. She is 34 years old and the mother of five children, four of whom are enrolled in the local school and the youngest one is too young to work or study. \n\nAll the members in this group loan are end-of-term loans so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loans term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make their payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s client make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":392199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To ask for a loan to buy fertilizer and she would use the rest of money to buy piglet for breeding.

To make a living, Rosalinda owns & operates a business raising pigs for sale. Rosalinda has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rosalinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosalinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase piglets to raise & sell in the future. Rosalinda is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Rosalinda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Unfortunately the salary that he was earning was minimal, and was not sufficient to support his family.  For this reason he decided to invest his savings to start up a store in his home where he started selling sweets and other small items.  In spite of the competition, his business is doing well.  He tries to keep it well-stocked so that his customers can always find what they need.  He works in the store and his wife helps him at times when he is absent, because he is also continuing to work independently as a cleaner 3 times a week.  With his income he has been able to buy a display case and a freezer which he needed to improve his business, and he also helps his son pay for his studies.\r\n\r\nFor the future, Se\u00f1or Nolasco wants to look for an appropriate site where he could have a bigger store in a strategic location.  He belongs to the communal bank \"Mujeres Rumo al Progreso,\" and it has helped him a lot with his projects.  He is the only man, and he is happy to be a part of the group. On this occasion he will use his loan to buy food for poultry, venturing into this area because the majority of his neighbors raise poultry, and they get a good price for this product.
