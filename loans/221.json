But it can be a big responsibility, too, especially if you are going to run that big family alone. This is the experience of Aleja F., 46, one of CCT*'s Community Partners in Manila. She is a widow with seven dependents. They used to live in Samar, Visayas few years back, but at present she and her family reside in Tondo, Manila.\r\n\r\nAleja's business is the buying and selling of plastic wares, through which she earns an average earning of Php11, 000 a month. She has done this kind of business for around two years by now. She conducts her daily business at home, with the help of a hired vendor.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting for a Php12,000 loan. She will use this fund to level up her plastic ware business, purchasing more products as she looks for more regular customers. With this, she will also have enough to pay the vendor she hires to sell her products. Indeed, this loan is one big step to help Aleja augment her family's daily needs, as it sustains her business.\r\n\r\nAleja says that the availability of a sales assistant is one major problem in her business. Sometimes, she finds no one available to work for her, which should not happen in any case. Nevertheless, she has big hopes that this problem will be met with a solution. Aleja hopes to save up and own a commercial space for her business. And the biggest dream of all, to see all of her children finish their schooling, because her family, big as it is, is all her heart could contain.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":696877,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics

Here Maria A. sells a variety of products retail.  She is currently taking advantage of the fact that this is a great time of year for selling gifts for women as Mothers' Day is approaching.  She has requested a Kiva loan to buy stuffed dolls, clothes and small electrical appliances which she will display in her store.  With these nicely packaged gifts, she intends to attract her customers' attention and awaken their interest in buying and their desire to buy.  This will mean they will buy her products and she will increase her sales.\r\n\r\nMaria started her business less than one year ago, selling school supplies.  She made this purchase with capital provided by her son whose goal was to increase their household income.  Initially, Maria worked in rented premises.  She has grown her business through the great service which she provides to her customers which means she earns every day.  Maria's dream for the future is to expand her business and set up new sales locations.  She will have to wait to do this as she has neither enough working capital nor the infrastructure to do it right now.

history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

As a farmer, however, she faces challenges such as the lack of rain, etc. Mariam is starting her first year with myAgro. She became convinced that she should join after talking to myAgro field representatives.

Flora owns a beauty salon which she runs with the assistance of two employees. Flora's salon generates approximately US$ 110 in profits each month.<P>Hair, hair and more hair! This is the place where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own. <P> This is Flora\u2019s second loan with SELFINA. She successfully paid back her initial loan of US$ 225, which has allowed her to request a larger amount this time. Flora is requesting a loan of US$ 625 to purchase necessary items such as hair products, wigs, and cosmetics for her salon. \r\n\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. <P>Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. <P>The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":191869,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional hair products for her beauty salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T00:10:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T07:44:24Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63,"local_amount":70560,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":73269,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356203},{"amount":62,"local_amount":69440,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:39Z","rounded_local_amount":72106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347945},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:03Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970519},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:27Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886736},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435996},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:59Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130294},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:14Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027125},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613165},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010248},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":72687.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232559}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T07:44:24Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65179,"name":"Dora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dora O., a 45-year-old a widow with three children, is a very dedicated owner and operator of a grocery shop selling such items as rice, evaporated milk, canned foods, drinks, assorted cooking oil, washing powder, toilet soaps, and candies in Obuasi, where she lives.

Otabek was born in 1978 in Shahrituz district. He is married and responsible for four people, including his wife and three children. Very dynamic, serious, and entrepreneurial, he is proposing to expand his herd and repair his enclosure so as to meet the needs of a rather large clientele from his village and its neighborhood, who buy animals from more than 20 km from his village. With this goal in mind, Otabek is requesting a loan that will serve as business capital. The profit he will make from this business will allow him to improve living conditions for his household and also make some investments. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged its already weak economy. 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable--conditions that have resulted in high levels of unemployment and forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her business targets female products, which include pants, shirts, underwear, cosmetics, and beauty supplies. Ligia is aware of the financial benefits of repeat customers, and therefore focuses her marketing strategy on obtaining long term clients. This is why her numerous clients look for her even when she\u2019s not around to place new orders. Some of her clients are from her prior business, where she prepared food. Ligia has two children and a husband that works as a plumber.\r\n\r\nLidia took the first step in building her credit in 2004 by starting her business with her first ACCION USA loan of $500. She has invested more than $2,000 in her business with the help of four loans from ACCION USA.

It was hard for her to do both, financially and time-wise, but she figured out how to get ahead and now everything is going well for her.  One of her desires is to dedicate herself to her profession.  Right now, she needs money to be able to get promotional products from the catalog and in this way sell more merchandise.

In 1990, she established her farming business, and by working six days a week and  four hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and repaid two loans from Patan BPW, having used her most recent one to purchase additional farming materials.  In the future, Sani Bahini plans to supply vegetable produce to local store.  She thanks you for your support. <p>\r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis loan is administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Pamela, 23, is single and currently lives with her parents.\n\nShe works making chocolates which she later sells to the people in her area.  She has been working like  this for more than two years.  Thanks to this business she has been able to finish her studies in hotel and tourism management.  In addition to this business, two months ago she began working in a factory, which gives her additional income. \n\nPamela's goal is to set up a juice bar in her home where she also can offer her chocolate products.

Kamol has a minivan with which he provides transportation services. Having attended to this business for eleven years, he has gained much experience. Initially he rented a car but, after making certain savings over time, he bought his own minivan. The business is stable and generates the main, considerable income for Kamol\u2019s family allowing improvement in their living conditions.\r\n\r\nCurrently Kamol\u2019s minivan needs some repairs. That\u2019s why he needs a loan of 8,000 Somoni to purchase the spare parts. Kamol thanks everyone for supporting him and promises to repay the loan with accuracy. The well-being of this family is in your hands.   \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in their own house. Along with her beloved father, she has been working for 30 years growing pineapple, coffee, bananas, and avocados and sells this produce and other jungle fruits in bulk, and in this way speeds up the harvest and sends it to the markets of Lima and Huancayo. What she most likes is to develop both activities, as she is considered to be a woman of much courage. As these activities are profitable, they have enabled her to buy more land to build a house and offer a decent standard of living to her children. For the time being, she will continue with this work with the goal of increasing the sale of fruits  until she can really become a distributor of jungle products. This is her second loan from MFP. She likes working with the savings group because the members are so responsible and punctual  that they are an example to follow. With the loan that she is requesting, she will buy sacks of organic fertilizer and agricultural tools such as machetes, hoes, picks, baskets, and sandpaper. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br

Mohon, Brgy. Kawit, Medellin, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a General Store business. Her common law husband Romeo, who is 49 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. Alicia  joined NWTF- Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF- Project Dungganon, Alicia  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use to buy stocks for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her store. Alicia D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Tolibjon is a very responsible and optimistic person. He has three children and a wife to support, so he wants to develop his business. This business consists of cattle-raising in his village because there is a very high demand for milk from villagers, and especially from customers who come from nearby towns. Tolibjon is helped by his children. He is currently faced with many problems because his children are growing and their expenses are growing accordingly. The only way to get out of this difficulty is to succeed in business, so we hope that his capabilities along with services provided by IMON International will help him improve his business.                                   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ravshan lives in Instaravshan, Tajikistan. He has four minor children. His wife helps him in business. He is engaged in the cultivation of agricultural products such as wheat and potatoes and also cattle breeding.

Thanks in advance IMON and KIVA he says!\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband is an entrepreneur and Muyassar started her business five years ago in order to support her family. All year she sells fruit that she buys from local farmers. Twice a week, Muyassar travels over 60 km to sell her produce at attractive prices at the busy market. With the loan of $1500 USD from Kiva, she plans to increase the range of her selling goods, and to buy more fruit to sell. Muyassar strives to give her children a better life than she has, including supporting them through a good education. Muyassar is a well-spoken, friendly businesswoman who is worthy of the support of Kiva partners.   \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They are noted for being very united.  Most of the members sell beauty products.\r\n\r\nMarina is a very enterprising, responsible woman; that is why she was elected group president.  She opened a store in her home many years ago.  That helped her support and educate her 5 children.  Marina's wish now is to help her neighbors by teaching them all she has learned during her life.\r\n\r\nLucila sells gelatin snacks and popsicles.  It has been a good business for her; she has been doing it for 7 years.  She's also a seamstress and is very well-known by her neighbors who bring her much sewing work to be done.  She is happy because these occupations allow her to support her family together with her husband.\r\n\r\nSegunda sells various products like: shoes, clothes, underwear.  Often she even sells prepared meals as requested.  Her only interest is the wellbeing of her family.\r\n\r\nThe financing will be used to buy ingredients and products for their various businesses.

He also takes charge of his half-sisters.\r\n\r\nHis main activity is retail commerce which he embarked on ten years ago. His secondary activity is vegetable gardening, which is quite developed in Notto, due to its privileged position in the Niayes area of Senegal. The area is rather unique, characterized by dunes and depressions often flooded by an overflowing water table, and a favourable climate. This environment was certainly attractive to the population and gave the whole region its agronomic vocation.\r\n\r\nMr. N. has practiced vegetable gardening for the past 20 years, influenced by his father who had the same activity. In fact, Mr. N. started helping his father in his gardening work from an early age. He eventually took the initiative to develop his own commercial activity, which allowed him to develop relations with the outside world.\r\n\r\nWhen U-IMCEC opened a branch office in 2009 to help producers in the area, Mr. N. became a member and is now requesting a first loan for 50,000 FCFA. He wants to buy bags of vegetables (potatoes,\u2026) he will resell at the market.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Eight members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. Group members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia's poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to repay. Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":203331,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizer ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2008-09-16T19:30:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-30T20:00:01Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":163636.36},{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":163636.36},{"due_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":163636.36},{"due_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":163636.36},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":163636.36},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":163636.36},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":163636.36},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":163636.36},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":163636.36},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":163636.36},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":163636.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":302261.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35940317},{"amount":0.75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-28T07:37:36Z","rounded_local_amount":3022.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52905723},{"amount":0.03,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-18T07:56:50Z","rounded_local_amount":100.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63127808},{"amount":299.38,"local_amount":1197500,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T11:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1206526.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73551271},{"amount":74.84,"local_amount":299400,"processed_date":"2012-05-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:41:04Z","rounded_local_amount":301656.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276572912}],"funded_date":"2008-09-16T20:00:01Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T08:41:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":69334,"name":"Charles","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Charles T. est \u00e2g\u00e9 de32 ans et est propri\u00e9taire d'une boutique d'alimentation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 Ap\u00e9y\u00e9m\u00e9, une ville \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du Togo situ\u00e9e sur les plateaux de Danye \u00e0 175 kilom\u00e8tres de Lom\u00e9, la capitale.

She is taking out a loan for turnover in her livestock business. At present she has four cows and ten sheep. She wants to use this next loan to purchase feed for her sheep. According to Musharaf, she has MicroInvest to thank for the constant turnover in cattle, the fattening and selling that provides her with an income.

Ulukberdi is 58 years old. He is married and the father of 4 children. Ulukberdi is a hard-working and enterprising man who constantly tries to improve and do things better every day. He works hard in his fields where he spends as much time as possible providing the necessary care, fertilizing his land and spraying to prevent diseases and improve his yields.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

To make a living, she prepares and sells cooked food for daily meals. She has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately $94 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Alma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make the products she sells. \r\n\r\nAlma is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.

Kisumu is the region in Kenya where Lake Victoria is located. Charles sells microphones, speakers, VCDs,  and DVDs to the local people. He has been in this business for eight years. His business is profitable and the major challenge he faces is that he does not have a permanent place to run his business. At times, Charles also gets harassed by the local government. However, he works very hard to keep his business doing well. Charles is using his  80,000 KES loan to buy more electronics to increase his business, especially during this festive season. He hopes to acquire a permanent retail shop within the town. He sees himself being the major supplier of electronics in the city in the future. He describes himself as honest and trustworthy.

de 21 y 16 a\u00f1os en el barrio Los Jardines de la ciudad de Cartagena, la m\u00e1s tur\u00edstica e hist\u00f3rica de Colombia. Ella tiene en su residencia un taller de modister\u00eda en el cual produce principalmente blusas, faldas y vestidos de mujer. Aprendi\u00f3 ese oficio hace veinte a\u00f1os ayud\u00e1ndole a una amiga en otro taller, luego decidi\u00f3 independizarse y compro su primera m\u00e1quina de coser. Hoy cuenta con una buena clientela formada por vecinos, familiares, amigos y referidos de otros sectores de la ciudad. El \u00e9xito de su negocio est\u00e1 en producir prendas sobre medida, porque seg\u00fan ella, no existen dos mujeres que tengan cuerpos id\u00e9nticos. Adem\u00e1s de confeccionar, la se\u00f1ora Sandra suele aconsejar a sus clientas qu\u00e9 tipo de moda y color es el que mejor se acomoda a su figura. Con los ingresos que genera su negocio aporta a la financiaci\u00f3n del 40 % de los gastos familiares y ha podido sufragar los estudios universitarios de su hijo mayor. Este es el sexto pr\u00e9stamo que tramita con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo y planea invertirlo en la compra de telas, hilos y accesorios. Con el  primer  pr\u00e9stamo recibido compr\u00f3 una m\u00e1quina de coser industrial y con el segundo una fileteadora, esto le ha permitido mejorar sustancialmente el acabado de las prendas.Sus ventas mensuales ascienden a $1.200.000 COP y el margen de utilidad es del 45%.  La se\u00f1ora Sandra alterna su oficio de confeccionista con la producci\u00f3n de adornos en cer\u00e1mica. En la decoraci\u00f3n de estos \u00faltimos le colabora su hijo menor en sus ratos libres, ella dice que hay que ser ingeniosos a la hora de generar ingresos porque en materia de trabajo no se pueden colocar todos los huevos en la misma canasta.","en":"Sandra V\u00e1squez L. is 39 years old.  She lives with her husband and two children, aged 21 and 16, in Los Jardines neighborhood, in the city of Cartagena, the most historic city in Colombia which also attracts most tourists.\r\n\r\nSandra has a dressmaking workshop in her home where she mainly makes women's blouses, skirts and dresses.  She learned this trade twenty years ago, helping a friend in another workshop.  She then decided to start working independently and bought her first sewing machine.  Today she has a good customer base made up of neighbors, family members, friends and people from other areas of the city who she has been recommended to.  The success of Sandra's business lies in producing made-to-measure clothes because she believes that no two women have identical bodies.\r\n\r\nAs well as making clothes, Sandra usually advises her customers about what type of fashion and color best suits their figure.  She uses the profits from her business to cover 40% of her family's expenses and she has also been able to pay for her eldest son's university studies.\r\n\r\nThis is Sandra's sixth loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she plans to invest it in buying fabric, threads and accessories.  She used her first loan to buy an industrial sewing machine and her second to buy an overlock sewing machine.  This has allowed her to substantially improve the finishing steps of making her clothes.\r\n\r\nSandra's monthly sales amount to 1,200,000 Colombian pesos and her profit margin is 45%.  Sandra divides her time between her dressmaking business and making ceramic decorations.  Her youngest son helps her to decorate these in his free time.  She says that you have to be clever when it comes to making income because, as far as work is concerned, you can't afford to put all your eggs in one

northern Sierra Leone. This school was opened in 1935 by the Roman Catholic church to educate the children of Lunsar and it environs. Presently, the school has 18 teachers and about 800 pupils. Over the years, the school has produced a great number of lecturers, teachers, and other professionals in different walks of life. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan this school is accessing from Kiva through SMT. School staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nForty-two year old Abdul H. T. (pictured back row, second from right) is a teacher at the school, and leader of this group. Born in Freetown, Abdul now lives and works in his mother\u2019s hometown of Lunsar.

It is located in San Vicente de Ju\u00e1rez, Ayala, in the State of Morelos, Mexico.  It is made up of Olegaria and Maribel, who will use their loan to buy dough, tortillas and meat for preparing their meals; Macedonio, who will buy men's women's and children's shoes; Edilia, who will buy soft drinks, milk, eggs and sugar to stock her business and Oliva, who will buy rolls, ham, cheese, vegetables and sausages to make sandwiches.\r\n\r\nOliva is 26 years old.  She is a single mother and has two daughters: 5 year-old Lalis and 3 year-old Emily.  They are living with her parents.  Oliva has a business selling Avon and Jafra perfumes and cosmetics, and bedspreads through catalogs.  She requested her loan to invest in perfumes, cosmetics and bedspreads so that she would have merchandise to offer her customers.  She does not sell from a fixed sales location.  She goes door to door to sell her products.  Oliva started this business one year ago.  Her cousin invited her to do it and it seemed a good idea.  She learned the business herself.  She places her orders and they give her one month's credit.  She is very happy with the loan that she is going to be given.  She will invest it in her business so that she can offer the products to her customers and have them in stock.\r\n\r\nOliva hopes to build a room, if God so wishes, so that she can live there with her daughters and make progress.

He works very hard and spends all his time with his animals, cleaning them, feeding and pasturing. Now Shokirjon wants to expand his business and buy more cattle. So, he applied for a loan of $3,000 USD. Shokirjon thanks all lenders for their support.    \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

opportunities to get ahead in life are often times within reach for those that know how to take advantage of them.  This is a very common saying in the life of Antolina, who works hard each day for the well-being of her four little children.  It's because of them that she has decided to opt for keeping her family together, in spite of the immense effort that this takes. <p>\r\n\r\nFor a long time, her husband worked away from home as a construction worker and one day, because of his great desire to learn, he decided to work under a recognized master baker in his city and learn to how to makes bread. The constant trips that he took brought much sadness to his young children.  For that reason, they both decided to open a bakery in their small home, after seeing the need in their neighborhood.  Three months have already gone by since their family has been together and Antolina has been enjoying this very much.  Although the sacrifice to produce the breads is very arduous, she feels very happy to be with her husband.  <p>\r\n\r\nThey begin making the bread at three in the morning and then later, distribute it to the stores in their neighborhood.  Antolina also has a second job, working in an ice-cream factory.  Although now, because of decreased temperatures that are occuring every day, the demand (for ice cream) has diminished considerably.  However, she will continue to work hard to earn the money that will allow her to sustain her children.  To reach this goal, she wishes to increase the production of bread even more and to improve their little bakery by obtaining a machine that will allow her to increase the quality of production of their delicious and exquisite breads.  \r\n\r\n<p>Because of this, she has come to these integral people (Microfinanzas PRISMA), so that she can obtain this loan that she so yearns for to make her projects a reality.

For these reasons Guirmen is asking you for a loan, which he promises to repay soon.\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Jordan Shanker, Kiva volunteer. <b><p>\r\n\r\nGuirmen es un hombre trabajador que se dedica al transporte de pasajeros desde hace varios a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s, es propietario de tres motocarros, uno de ellos lo maneja el mismo y los otros por dos de sus sobrinos a quienes les brinda trabajo de esa forma. Guirmen tiene 37 a\u00f1os y es padre de 2 hijos los cuales estudian y lo quieren mucho, su esposa se dedica a la venta de comida por las noches. Lo m\u00e1s importante para Guirmen es hacer estudiar a sus hijos para que logren ser buenos profesionales.Ahora necesita comprar repuestos para sus motocarros y darles un mantenimiento completo, posteriormente quiere apoyar a su se\u00f1ora  mandando a construir un kiosco para la venta de comida, porque actualmente lo hace de manera ambulante.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For the past 13 years, he has dedicated himself to the cultivation of beans, corn and coffee. He finds this profession very satisfying, since he learned how to work on a farm when he was just a small child. The beans allow him to earn money every three months, when he sells his harvest at his city's local market. Although the prices for this product are not very high, he is able to obtain the necessary basics to satisfy his family's needs while they wait for the \"bonanza\" months, which are when the family harvests and sells their coffee.

She lives with her parents and her greatest desire is to get ahead in life.  She is a weaver.  Her work starts very early in the morning when, together with her mother, they begin to work on the special designs that they have on order.  She is a very good weaver so her creations are very pretty and attractive.  What she likes the most about her work is to weave, more so if the items are handicrafts.  She has been in this line of work for 4 years and considers the most difficult part of the job having to work all day in order to fill their standing orders.  For the future, she would like to be able to buy new looms so that production can be faster.  This is Velinda's second loan with MFP and she is willing to make her repayments on time even if that means saving up little by little.  She is a very well-liked member of her communal bank.

Others made improvements with the help of advisors. As a result all of them have kept up their incomes. In general they feel very pleased to belong to the group, as in one way or another the group's knowledge helps each of them in their various jobs.\r\n\r\nOne example from the group is 30-year old Sra. Antonia G. Britez who has three children. They stay at home while she goes out to sell her products. She sells chipa (a kind of bread made from starch obtained from yucca or cassava, maize flour, cheese, lard, and milk). As she doesn't have a stall, she goes to traffic lights and sells to bus passengers.  So she covers a lot of ground each day in order to have good sales. She returns home to prepare lunch and goes out again in the afternoons to make more sales.\r\n\r\nAntonia is a long-suffering woman whose daily life is hard. When she gets home from work, she has to do the household chores and everything else that will help her family get ahead as she is a single mother.\r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to cover various expenses and to buy chipa to sell as this is how she supports her family.\r\n\r\n  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva

It has been a long road to recovery since the damaging disaster. After finally building her business to what it once was, the oil spill has affected Mary\u2019s Floor World as well. People are not investing in their homes, corporations are hiring other large companies to renovate commercially instead of hiring small businesses, and many locals are without jobs. Small businesses in her city are struggling but with the new mayor and police chief\u2019s dedication to recovery, Mary is incredibly hopeful that New Orleans will return to the city it once was. \r\n\r\nMary says, \u201cSince Katrina and the recent oil spill, everything has been chaos.\u201d She took out her first loan earlier this year with ACCION Texas-Louisiana to finance a major job. \u201cNormally, I would have never needed to go to anyone to finance a job, but I need funds and the bank rejected my loan application.\u201d She paid back the loan within 30 days after the job was completed.

With this recent loan, she will finally have the means to do the necessary repairs and renovations to her office that will communicate to the public her business\u2019s full recovery from the hurricane and the oil spill. \r\n\r\nMary is hopeful that the city of New Orleans will get back on its feet again and that the local businesses will thrive. Her advice to small business owners is, \u201cIf you really want your business to succeed, you have to hang in there no matter how bad it is. Sometimes, it gets pretty tough.
