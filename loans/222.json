Her father was a fisherman, and caught trout in the local rivers near Trujillo, Peru, where she grew up. When she turned 20 years old, Maria opened a small \u201ccevicheria,\u201d adjacent to her home, and served the trout, cooked without heat by marinating the meat in limejuice. Seven years ago, her husband abandoned her for another woman, and Maria was left to care for her 3 children alone.<p>Deciding to make a fresh start, Maria moved to Ayacucho, Peru, where she had distant relatives. She used her savings to rent a counter section at the central market, where she sells her ceviche and sodas to up to 50 customers a day. She can be found at her stall, which is equipped with a sink and preparation area, 7 days a week, from about 9 am until quite late at night, or until her supply of fish runs out. Dressed in the traditional white chef hat and apron, Maria exudes experience and professionalism. A steady stream of customers visits her kiosk, and business really picks up during the lunch hour. She serves a generous portion of the diced fish, with potatoes, onions, and a lettuce garnish.<p>For her next loan, Maria hopes to receive US$500. For now, her stall is modestly equipped with the most basic utilities. She would use the money from this loan for a small refrigeration device that she could install under the preparation counter. For now, Maria must store the fish, which comes frozen twice a week from Lima, at her home, and prepare the ceviche there as well. With refrigeration at her kiosk she would not have to carry the heavy dishes to work, and would be able to avoid the risk of running out of food on a busy day.<p>Maria V. belongs to a village bank called \u201cAyni\u201d which is a quechua (native language) word that means \u201cI help you now, you help me later\u201d.

The hardest part about his job is that is it not steady employment, but ready sporadic. After he completes a construction project there is a lapse of time he is without work. It is in those times that he decided to do carpentry to supplement his income. Melquiades is currently on the second cycle of his first loan with Microfinanzas Prisma and he is very punctual with his payments. With the funds from this loan he will purchase tools for his work as a laborer and as a carpenter, so that he may build a better future.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":222102,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To purchase tools for his work as a laborer and as a carpenter.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-18T12:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Melquiades","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":178.84},{"due_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":176.44},{"due_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":192.44},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":197.52},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":203.23},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":209.63},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":218.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":223.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":58.68},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":57.89},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":63.14},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":64.81},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.68},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.64},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.68,"local_amount":178.84,"processed_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:39:27Z","rounded_local_amount":181.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5336166},{"amount":57.89,"local_amount":176.44,"processed_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:18:03Z","rounded_local_amount":179.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957582},{"amount":63.14,"local_amount":192.44,"processed_date":"2009-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":195.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227838},{"amount":64.81,"local_amount":197.52,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:02:14Z","rounded_local_amount":200.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423068},{"amount":66.68,"local_amount":203.23,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:33:05Z","rounded_local_amount":206.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116307},{"amount":68.78,"local_amount":209.63,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:42:51Z","rounded_local_amount":212.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011256},{"amount":71.64,"local_amount":218.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:35Z","rounded_local_amount":221.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594866},{"amount":73.38,"local_amount":223.57,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:31Z","rounded_local_amount":226.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989272}],"funded_date":"2008-11-18T16:04:28Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":77172,"name":"Maria Zulma","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Maria, socia del BC \u201cLa Mujer Riojana\u201d\u201d, vive en la Regi\u00f3n San Mart\u00edn, provincia y distrito de  Rioja.

She is married with three children, between the ages of 11 and 17. Angela has been running a poultry business since 2006. She raises kuku, which means chicken in Swahili. This is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients and is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, poultry raising requires little start-up capital and you can start with one or two, and slowly add more to your flock or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space- they can run in your garden or compound. Thirdly, they produce eggs while being raised for meat and the eggs can be sold to provide additional  income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. \r\n\r\nShe works at her business seven days per week and is assisted by one employee. Angela currently earns about 120 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase chicks and feed. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Angela thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\t\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is it allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Smoked cow skin is a popular source of meat used in preparation of sauces and favourite local dishes like \"waakye\" and \"banku\".

Her business lets her earn a profit of 16,500 per month.  <P>\r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 12,000 loan.

She did not complete secondary school for destiny prevented her from doing so; she left her schooling in order to incorporate herself into farming where she grows cocoa and fruit trees.\r\n\r\nDespite obstacles, she is not discouraged of reaching her goals.  Through traditional farming methods she is preserving farming techniques of her ancestors and helping to protect the environment.  \r\n\r\nDuring planting and harvest seasons she hires farmhands to help her with these chores and sometimes her relatives help her out too.

She is married to Jorge, who is 64. Together they have 8 children but she only lives with 6 of them in her own home. She works in carpentry. She starts very early. Her husband makes the designs, cutting the wood and giving form to the furniture, while Teodora does the necessary finishings: sanding doors, windows, dressers, desks, beds, among others. What she likes the most is working in her husband's company. She affirms that being co-workers has united the couple more, sharing accomplishments and failures. This profession is very profitable because with the earnings they were able to pay for their children's education, buy land, build their house, and buy a motorcycle cab that they rent and which brings in extra income. This is why she is very enthusiastic about growing the carpentry shop; she also hopes to finish building more rooms in her residence. This is her sixth loan with MFP and she is very enthusiastic about continuing to work in her community group, where she is president of the board of directors. With the loan she is asking for, she will buy wood to continue making furniture. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

To make a living, Belinda owns and operates a business venture in the food sector operating a fishing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling seafood product such as fish in the local community. Belinda has been engaged in her business for over 7 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Belinda joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Belinda has successfully repaid a previous loan from GDMPC. Belinda S.'s group is requesting a new loan of 10,000.00 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Belinda from GDMPC.

The last 15 years have been marked by fluctuations in his fortunes. The bad times have not caught him off balance and in the good times, he has kept his feet on the ground.

The customers of the store are mainly the village population. \r\n\r\nZurab is heading up the farming activities of the family. The family owns 3 hectares of land, where maize, beets and onions are grown. Harvested crops are sold locally. The total average monthly income of the family is 1000 Laris (approximately 600 USD), including Natia\u2019s parents\u2019 pensions.\r\n\r\nNatia requested credit for purchasing grocery products for the store. She will increase her stock in trade and offer a wider assortment of products to her customers. It will increase the sales and thus the income of the family. Natia will use the ncreased income for improving family living conditions.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Canjusa, Pulupandan, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nFelicidad has earned a living selling \"Ginamos\", a local delicacy made from fermented salted krill, for 30 years of her life. When her husband died, she became depressed from her loss that she thought of giving up her business, but with no adult children to support her, she realized that she had to plan ahead and be financially self-sufficient in her old age. \r\n\r\nWith the moral support of her friends and the encouragement from Project Dungganon, Felicidad decided to continue with her Ginamos business, which now provides sufficiently for her by netting an average of PHP 7,000 per month.\r\n\r\nFor her 12th loan cycle, Felicidad is borrowing PHP 18,000.00 to add to her capital so that she could have more Ginamos to sell. The advantage of Ginamos over other food stuff is that like fine wine, it improves with age. \r\n\r\nWhat is Ginamos?\r\n\r\nGinamos is a generic Hiligaynon (the local dialect in Western Visayas) term for anything that is salted and aged to ferment - in Tagalog it is known as Bagoong. Ginamos can also refer to fermented salted fish, mussels, oysters, etc. but in general, the term Ginamos refers to mashed salted fermented krill - all the others must be qualified - e.g. Ginamos na isda (fermented salted fish) or Ginamos na Tahong (fermented salted mussels).\r\n\r\nGinamos is prepared by mashing sea salt and krill together until the salt is well mixed into the finely ground krill, then it is kept in containers to age until ready. Ginamos in Negros Island is usually moist but firm and sold by the block or smaller bricks. Vendors usually pre-cut the blocks into different sizes to offer the buyers a selection. People usually buy Ginamos either as a flavor enhancer to dishes like Pinakbet (a vegetable stew) or as a dish by itself. When cooked as a dish, it is usually mixed with vinegar and sauteed with lots of garlic and sometimes with fried pork rind, and is served with rice as a meal or with green mangoes as an appetizer.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":362133,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL FOR THE BORROWER","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bago, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-07-31T19:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":720},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":720}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":5040,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T20:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":5046.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73648912},{"amount":88.33,"local_amount":4240,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T00:31:28Z","rounded_local_amount":4245.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87088277},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2880,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:06:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2883.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97004026},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2880,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2883.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103848804},{"amount":61.67,"local_amount":2960,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:00:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2963.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739477}],"funded_date":"2009-08-01T08:12:19Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:00:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elrico Mu\u00f1oz","image":279082}},{"id":130450,"name":"Olinto Valle Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El grupo Olinto Valle es originario del centro de Masaya, sus integrantes son Juana Adela C.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have five children who are 14 to 27 years old. Rosalina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosalina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,500 which she intends to use to buy grocery items for her general store so that she can continue to save up for future improvements of her business.  Rosalina T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have a viable business proposition.

Mar\u00eda de la Paz Hern\u00e1ndez is a working woman who sells new clothing, such as jeans, shirts, blouses, bedclothes, and underwear.  She sells her merchandise in the community where she lives and has a stand set up in her house.  Currently, she also sells her goods at a melon packing company called Excosur.  She hopes to continue growing her business, since it has allowed her to help her husband improve the livelihood of their children.  She has two girls who are currently in school and they help their mother with her business in their free time.  Her husband is a construction worker who works at various locations in the village.\r\n\r\nAna Isabel \u00c1lvarez is a young, married woman with a 6 year old girl.  Ana sells snacks such as enchiladas, tacos, small cakes, and banana chips.  She sells her goods out of the her house and her business and sales have grown to the point that she spends every afternoon selling her snacks. The entire village comes to buy and she runs out of all of her products.  She wants to purchase vegetables, such as tomatoes, onions, chilis, and cabbage from the sellers in cars that pass through the village.  Also, she wants to buy condiments and other goods that she can buy from the local store.  With these, she hopes to continue growing her business.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Luisa Madariaga has been selling food and snacks for 4 years.  Previously, she sold her products exclusively out of her home, but since her business has grown, she now also sells in Excosur and Promangle.  This has generated income that has helped her husband with the household expenses.  She is the mother of three children, one is in 4th grade and the others are not yet old enough for school.  She leaves her children with her mother when she leaves to go sell her goods.  Her husband is a welder and is not able to spend very much time at home.\r\n\r\nEtelvina Sarai has been selling new clothing for 4 years.  She travels to the city of Choluteca every 15 days to buy men's, women's, and children's clothing.  She leaves the house every day to sell her clothes in Excosur.

He has learned to raise them well so that he can market them. Khurshed is married and has three children to provide for. To support his family, he has to invest in his livestock business and, consequently, he's approached IMON International to apply for a loan.  The loan will allow him to purchase young cattle and to feed them, which in turn will increase his income from the milk, meat, horn, and other goods provided by these cattle.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Makawili, Barangay Balaring, Silay City, Negros Occidental. She is 49 years old and married to Ramon O., who currently works as a fish vendor in their local community. The couple is blessed with four children who are 16 to 26 years old, with the three younger kids still attending school. Her most cherished aspiration is to provide her children, through her own efforts and hard work, with a good life and a good education that will empower them to have gainful work and a bright future.\r\n\r\nWhen Marjolyn\u2019s children were so much younger, she realized that her husband's income would not be sufficient to sustain the growing needs of their family, especially in relation to her dream of sending her children to college. This is why she decided to go into business for herself by starting a general store.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, when Marjolyn wanted to expand her business, she decided to join NWTF-Project Dungganon. From the loan assistance she received, she was able to enlarge her product offerings and thereby increase her income capacity, which now averages PHP 8,000 net profit. Her increased income enabled her to invest in other businesses as the years went by and now she has a fishing boat that provides additional income for her and her family.\r\n\r\nFor her last loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marjolyn borrowed PHP 15,000 which she used as additional income for both her general store and her fishing business. Now that she has fully repaid that loan within its loan term, she is again applying to renew her loan for the same amount of PHP 15,000 to use as working capital for her two businesses. She hopes to be able to buy some household appliances and have her house repaired with the income she earns from this loan.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":423428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

R., 53, lives in the Mallco Chapi area, which is about 21km from the city of Cochabamba.  He has been married to Evarista for over 23 years and they have a 20 year-old son that lives with them.  Their son helps him care for the cows in addition to studying at an institute in Cochabamba.  Dionicio is a raw milk dairy farmer and also grows various crops on his lands.  He has 5 dairy cows at home and they are his main source of income.  The funding will be used to buy another dairy cow so that he can increase milk production and thereby his earnings.

After she was recognized as a member, she submitted her request for a loan, which she will use to purchase a hog\/pig for fattening.

Her friendliness, charisma, and good service have made her store a favorite among her neighbors and customers who make their purchases early in the morning, because hers is the first store to open and the last to close.\r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys most about her work is conversing with her neighbors about the things that go on in the neighborhood.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ni Nyoman is requesting for the first time a loan from MUK in the amount of 3,000,000 IDR which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future.  Ni Nyoman plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nShe also dreams of seeing all of her sons succeed and for MUK, she hopes than she can get a lower interest rate for next loan--maybe under 1 %.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout MUK:\r\n\r\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation and loans, thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nNi Nyoman K. (PK-10299) merupakan 48 tahun wanita.  Dia (perempuan) tinggal di kota Melaya - Bali.  Dia (perempuan) menikah dan memiliki 2 anak usia dewasa.  Untuk membiayai hidup, Ni Nyoman memiliki & menjalankan usaha.  Bisnis beroperasi di sektor pertanian.  Tujuan utama bisnis tersebut adalah memelihara ternak.  Meskipun bukan satu-satunya sarana untuk menghasilkan pendapatan, sumber utama penghasilan bisnis tersebut terutama berasal dari beternak babi untuk dijual.  Ni Nyoman sudah menjalankan bisnis ini selama lebih dari 7 tahun.  Dari kegiatan-kegiatan ini, Ni Nyoman menghasilkan sekitar 500,000 IDR sebulan.\r\n\r\n\r\nDalam 2010, Ni Nyoman bergabung MUK untuk mendapatkan akses ke layanan keuangan untuk membantu meningkatkan  -nya kondisi kehidupan dan kemampuan untuk menjalankan kegiatan bisnis.  Ni Nyoman telah berhasil melunasi pinjaman sebelumnya dari MUK.    Dia (perempuan) sekarang meminta pinjaman baru sebesar 3,000,000 IDR.  Pinjaman saat ini akan digunakan untuk untuk membeli bibit ternak untuk dibesarkan & dijual di masa mendatang.  Pinjaman ini akan menjadi 1st pinjaman yang diambil oleh peminjam dari MUK.  Ni Nyoman berencana untuk menggunakan pendapatan tambahan yang dihasilkan dari bisnis  untuk meningkatkan\/memperluas bisnis peminjam.\r\n\r\n\r\nTentang MUK:\r\n\r\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di Bali dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\r\n\r\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir. Ini adalah praktek umum dan efisien di daerah ini, tapi merumitkan cara lapor untuk Kiva. Tidak serupa pinjaman lain, partner Kiva, MUK, akan menjadi kontak utama dengan tim kepemimpinan grup, yang sebaliknya menjadi kontak dengan peminjam akhir. Demikian, jurnal yang ditulis akan merefleksikan hasilnya tim kepemimpinan, bukannya peminjam-peminjam akhir.\r\n\r\nUntuk belajari lebih banyak tentang Village Banking di Wikipedia, mohon kunjungi website ini: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking..  \t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":596999,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-09-09T20:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":17.03,"local_amount":146000,"processed_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":153555.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177441012},{"amount":332.97,"local_amount":2854000,"processed_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3001694.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182580949}],"funded_date":"2010-09-09T23:30:00Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:48:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":233736,"name":"Norma's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norma P. is from the village of San Roque, Enrile, Cagayan.

that could yield enough money to support his wife and family for the long term, particularly so that his children can finish their studies. For this reason, he took what little savings he had and started his own bread \u201clepeshka,\u201d a bakery business at home. With only a few utensils and clients but with faith and enthusiasm, he has made his business successful by growing a loyal clientele little by little. However, Ravshan wishes to offer his clients better services so that they do not seek other competing businesses. He also wants to be able to attract more clients. He is therefore requesting a loan in the amount of $1,000 USD. With this money, Ravshan will be able to buy more products for making lepeshka and will be able to make improvements to his offerings. With these improvements, Ravshan expects to attract more clients and will be capable of supporting his family and continuing to fund his children\u2019s studies. His goal is to be able to offer a better future to his family.   \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

To that end, she applies high standards of cleanliness when preparing the food she sells. She would like to expand her business in order to better satisfy costumer demand. This is the first time she has applied for a loan from Edpyme Alternativa; she has asked for 1000 new soles. She will use the money to buy food supplies for her food business. \r\n\r\nRosa is a hard-worker and very responsible and dedicated to her family. Her greatest wish is to provide her young children with the opportunity for a better future through a university profession. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Montserrat Zuckerman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":505872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy food supplies to make hamburgers and salchipollos.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-03-15T18:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":46.38},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.34},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":47.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":48.04},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":48.19},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":48.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":49.11},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":49.47},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":49.69},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50.95},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.23},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":51.7},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":52.47},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":52.69},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":53.21},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":53.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.39},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.63},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.88},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.02},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.07},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.28},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.42},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.63},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.97},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.21},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.53},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.68},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.76},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.95},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":88.67,"local_amount":236.45,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:42Z","rounded_local_amount":249.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934686},{"amount":73.32,"local_amount":195.52,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":205.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662308},{"amount":75.54,"local_amount":201.43,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:07Z","rounded_local_amount":212.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695012},{"amount":97.56,"local_amount":260.17,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":274.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878057},{"amount":39.91,"local_amount":106.43,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:39Z","rounded_local_amount":112.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618085}],"funded_date":"2010-03-15T21:32:54Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":188686,"name":"Epifania","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Epifania A. is from the village of Mambajao, Camiguin Province.

He rents a house with his wife Nidia, 27, and their 2 young children, to whom he wishes to provide a better quality of life. Farming has been a crucial part of Edwin's life. Since he was very young, Edwin's parents taught him that farming would provide him with everything he needed, which is why he decided to continue the work. He now has his own farm of potatoes and peas, which he sells in Tarma's wholesale market after harvest.\r\n\r\nEdwin started his farm 5 years ago and really enjoys the planting season. His family depends on his work for economic security. Climate changes affect his yield, so he tries to take good care of his crops. Edwin hopes to keep working and improving his crops. This is his 4th loan with MFP and he knows how important it is to the development of his work. In his community group Edwin is very responsible, which has earned him a lot of respect. With the 3,000 PEN loan he is requesting, Edwin will buy fertilizer to improve his harvest.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":565451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-11T12:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3034.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195426}],"funded_date":"2010-07-11T19:38:34Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vivian Lu","image":225936}},{"id":217364,"name":"Efua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Efua B. sells bags of water and soft drinks at Elmina.

Her husband is a lecturer and they have two children, 4 and 9 years old. Selina owns a cement distribution shop, where she supplies builders around the Kitengela area, an upcoming residential area where many buildings are being constructed.  Besides this business, she also has a container which she rents out to other people to use as a shop. She says that this business is profitable and the only major challenge she faces is competition from many people in the area doing the same kind of business as hers. She says that there are other people in Kitengela who are well established and own big hardware stores and even provide transport facilities.

Faced with the challenges of working hand in hand with her husband to take care of their kids, she finds it difficult to sponsor their education.  Due to her own lack of education, she could not secure a good job, so she embarked on farming.  \n  \nUnfortunately, she was not familiar with farming methods that could improve her output.  As a member of GHAPE, she was fortunate to acquire some techniques that have helped her improve on her farming and marketing strategies.\n\nNgwa F. has been successful at managing and paying back her previous loans.  With a new loan, she plans to invest it in farming and the selling of vegetable, garri (also known as tapioca), yams and potatoes.\n\nHer activities will help her community, as she will be able to supply the market with basic foodstuff. She will plow her profit back into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to pay her children;s school fees, and will save some for rainy days. Ngwa F. prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the instalmental method paying back the loan.\n\nAbout GHAPE \nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multifaceted approach.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

Muzaffar is 40 years old. He is married and has three children of school age. His wife is a teacher in a secondary school. \r\n\r\nMuzaffar manufactures national cradles. National cradles in Tajikistan are very colorful. They are made of wood. As a rule, the national cradle is presented by the grandparents when the baby is forty days old, and this event is celebrated by the entire family. \r\n\r\nMuzaffar has been in this business for seventeen years. His wife helps him. The completed cradles are purchased from their house. The stability of the business allows a steady income which ensures that the family has the possibility of improving their living conditions.\r\n\r\nMuzaffar has been working with IMON for four years. For the entire period of time he has shown himself as a successful client, managing his loans with accuracy and precision. Today Muzaffar requests a loan in the amount of $1500 in order to purchase more planks and paints for producing more cradles. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He had to drop out of his primary studies, and at the age of 15, he started his training as a tapestry-maker. At the end of his training, he could not get set up because he had no money to buy the necessary equipment, so he has to rent a sewing machine by the day, which he sets up on the side of the road to work. This is not at all profitable for him, because the cost for renting the machine is too high. Mr. A. therefore keeps sinking further into poverty with each passing day, despite his intelligence and creativity. He is currently asking for $950 in financial support, which would allow him to open and equip a workshop. The credit he is seeking would be enough to rent a workshop, and also to buy a sewing machine and other tapestry tools. With all of this, he would be able to have a stable income to meet the needs of his family.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Lisa Molle, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMonsieur A. Y.
