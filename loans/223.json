Ma'zoza wants to help her husband to get the necessary money, so she is taking a loan from FATEN. The new chickens will increase her husband\u2019s income and improve the family\u2019s living conditions. Ma'zoza is a conservative woman, so her husband is seen in the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see includes both the loan principal and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

is a very hard-working person that has always wanted the best for his family.

He also raises guinea pigs.  Proudly he tells us that he just harvested his pea crop and sold it in the city center with the help of his dear wife.

Therefore, after becoming more familiar with the fund\u2019s lending process, she and her husband requested a larger loan to buy a tractor pulled plough and grain harvesting machine. They rent out the equipment according to the seasons. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside of their rental business, her husband is a construction worker and she continues to raise livestock and cultivate plants. Their family\u2019s financial situation continues to improve because of their business-mindedness. They have a monthly income of about 4,000,000 VND.

For the last four years, her main task, very early in the morning, is to clean her farm and feed her animals.  She raises chickens and guinea pigs, which she sells on the weekends from her home.  Sometimes she sells at livestock markets near her home.  With the experience she has acquired, Hilda knows that in the first months of the year, sales decrease, and in later months there is greater demand.  This is when she generates the income she needs for her home.  Therefore, she would like to supplement her capital to take advantage of the busy season that is approaching for her business.  This is Hilda's first loan with MFP, and her first experience with a community bank. For Hilda, it is a challenge, because she has heard that solitary work is expressed in the work of the group.  The money she is requesting is to buy more chickens and guinea pigs to fatten for her customers during the coming months.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Novesky, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":323804,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase chickens and guinea pigs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-26T22:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":100,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":50.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990615},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:47Z","rounded_local_amount":50.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211726},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:44Z","rounded_local_amount":50.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641250},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080688},{"amount":33.32,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":100.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996821}],"funded_date":"2009-05-26T22:45:50Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:17:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":114504,"name":"Gune","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gune S. is currently in the business of selling clothes and is requesting a loan to stock more clothes to sell.

Ellos viajan dentro de la regi\u00f3n de Manab\u00ed para hacer sus ventas, por lo general venden en lugares que quedan a una hora de Jipijapa como Portoviejo y Manta.

She works as a salesperson, selling items for the home on credit from door to door.  For example, she sells sheets, bedspreads and plastic bed covers.  She has been doing this job for 10 years.  Her husband already was in this line of work when they met, and she decided to accompany him on his job.  They travel within the Manab\u00ed region to make their sales, generally selling in places that lie about one hour from Jipijapa, such as Portoviejo and Manta.  Most of the time, they sell their items to familiar customers, and their customers pay them for the goods in weekly installments.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Petita is requesting a loan in order to be able to buy a variety of more merchandise at wholesale.  She says that for the future she would like to have a good economic foundation and a little car, although she does see the difficulty of achieving success within the world's current economic situation.  Her sales have dropped recently, and she is considering changing her business sometime in the near future.  Her husband is also a cabinet-maker, and she would like run a carpentry business with him.  She thinks that such a business would be more stable, and would give them the chance to remain closer to their children as well (a cousin watches over them when she and her husband go out to sell).\r\n \r\nSe\u00f1ora Petita is a member of the Banco Comunal Nuevos Horizontes, which meets every 2 weeks in Jipijapa, Manab\u00ed, near the Ecuadorian coast.  Her bank is a large group that has worked many times with Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, and whose members support each other very well.  Se\u00f1ora Petita has spent 3 years working with her communal bank, and says that she likes it because ther are few places that are able to provide her with money so easily, without demanding excessive guarantees or paperwork.  The important thing, Se\u00f1ora Petita says, is to be responsible.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":363526,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Comprar m\u00e1s mercader\u00eda surtida al por mayor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Jipijapa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Petita Jacoba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":82.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:41:44Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035131},{"amount":84.38,"local_amount":82.5,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035132},{"amount":169.45,"local_amount":165.68,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":169.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947388},{"amount":83.67,"local_amount":81.82,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:29:37Z","rounded_local_amount":83.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789230},{"amount":84.38,"local_amount":82.5,"processed_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:06Z","rounded_local_amount":84.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789231},{"amount":84.37,"local_amount":82.5,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:50Z","rounded_local_amount":84.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789232}],"funded_date":"2009-09-02T22:09:46Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":130904,"name":"Beatrice N.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (Greetings!) from Tanzania.

All of them are the pride of their parents.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is an enterprising lady who is not afraid of challenges and therefore she started selling gas (cylinders) 6 years ago at her house.

She has two premises and works with two young men who help her with the distribution of the cylinders.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is also supported by her children and she is very happy as business has grown rapidly and is very profitable. Victoria likes her job as it is not a heavy one as she only administers. She works directly with a recognized gas company in Peru which gives warranty, and Victoria says it is not important that she earns less, the important thing is to offer security to the customers who buy gas on a monthly basis, and have confidence in her.

These individuals\u2019 livelihoods consists of sales including artistic manufactured and handcrafted wood pieces, the installation and maintenance of stoves, heaters, etc., and the sale of Avon cosmetic catalogue items, perfumes, firewood and coal, handcrafted steel structure items, eggs, cheeses and deli-store items.\r\n\r\nWilliam is the president of the group and, in the above photo, he can be found in the second row, first on the right right, wearing a red and black sport-jacket and holding Fondo Esperanza brochures in his hand.\r\n\r\nWilliam\u2019s business consists of manufacturing cars (the structures of vehicles), and also masonry (construction, fences, sheds, etc.). He has two employees that he oversees and they assist him in this work. This has been his source of income and his profession for the past seven years; he took this as his calling after completing a program at a professional institute. He will use this loan to purchase a machine that can cut metal.\r\n\r\nWilliam\u2019s dream is to have a professional mechanic\u2019s shop, with all the machinery that he is still missing (which he notes is a lot). At this point he has a small space available by his house for his shop, and it\u2019s slowly being adapted. William would also like to provide employment for more people and continue perfecting his profession.\r\n\r\nWilliam is grateful to Fondo Esperanza as it\u2019s been the only place where he\u2019s been able to obtain a loan as he has no credit history. That is to say, he has never had a credit card, which other financial institutions look at as a bad indicator, such that they neglect providing loans to those who seek to improve their business.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of Araucan\u00eda Region. It is located 670 kilometers south of Santiago (the capital of Chile) and possesses a series of lakeside spa resorts and striking native flora and fauna. This region is also noteworthy for being the region where 50% of Chile's existing indigenous Mapuche community live, some of whom are members of Fondo Esperanza communal banks.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3125,"image":{"id":581533,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal

Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, thus raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500 which she intends to use to buy more fish to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future and education of her children.

Elmira believes that education will open new doors into the future for her son. She says she\u2019s lucky to work at the same place as her husband. It allows her to spend more time with him and quickly solve various problems. She is employed as a janitor, while her husband is a security officer. Along with these jobs the family has livestock and resells them frequently. Four years of cattle resells has helped the family to make major repairs in the house and a shed. The revenue is usually spent on family needs and invested back in the business. Elmira and her group have know each other for a very long period, and are sure to repay the loan successfully. Elmira\u2019s purpose for the loan is to invest these funds back in her business and buy some more cattle.

She buys groceries like canned goods, condiments, milk, and sugar: primary commodities that are needed in every household. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors in the local community. She earns a minimum of 350 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 23,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy more grocery items in order to have more inventory. The more items displayed at the store, the better. It will help to attract more customers to buy in her variety store. More sales will result in more profits. It will help her to save more money for her utility bills. \r\n\r\nBaruela hopes that her business will continue to generate an income that is sufficient enough for the needs of her family. She dreams that she can continue to help some of her extended family. She wants to share her blessings with those who are in need. She hopes that her children will have their own families someday. She is active in attending the weekly fellowship* as it inspires her to be more God-loving, and it strengthens her spiritual life.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

They live in polygamous families with their husbands, their husbands\u2019 other wives, and their children in the village of Sikouna 2 (Koulikoro Region, Republic of Mali). Their business consists of selling charcoal, which they buy from farmers who have licenses to cut down trees and produce charcoal. They have a place to store the charcoal in their family homes and generally sell it retail to a diverse clientele (men and women) and wholesale to people who have market stands in big cities like S\u00e9gou Fana and Bamako. Brought together by the fact that they are in the same trade, live in the same village and are each experienced in business, the members of the group decided that in order to generate additional income, they would join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, from which they are receiving their first group loan. With this loan, they intend to buy an average of 25 bags of charcoal each (1,000 CFA francs per bag). Each bag will then be sold for 1,500 CFA francs, generating a weekly profit of 12,500 CFA francs. This profit will help pay off the interest on the loan and will above all help them to develop their business.

She would like to buy her goods in bulk whenever she travels to the city in order to reduce the problem of frequent treks. \r\n\r\nGladys' village bank is called \u201cfear not\u201d. She hopes to receive GH\u00a2500 to improve her business by restocking her inventory. It has been her dream to equip her children with a quality education.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They live happily with their four children in the village of San Nicolas, Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya. They want their children to finish their studies and become successful someday. \r\n\r\nHer husband works as a tricycle driver while Marietta provides Pedicure and Manicure services in their village. She offers her services to her neighbors, especially the employees within their village. Through her patience and sacrifices, she can earn a net income of PHP600.00 a week, which she uses to acquire their daily needs and for the allowances of their children. She wants to offer her services to the nearby villages but she doesn\u2019t have enough capital.

This is very organized group despite this being their first loan cycle, and the members have shown themselves to be very hard-working and dedicated mothers. For example, the group's president makes a living helping her husband weld doors, rakes and wheelbarrows, and they already have a good amount of experience. Neidy is very pleased with working out of her own home beside her husband and close to her children since there aren't many women who work and can share that experience with their families. The rest of the members make a living in different activities such as selling clothing, making and distributing empanadas, candy, vegetables and other food items, and in public transportation. The members say they have a lot of competition, but they keep working to make headway and improve the quality of life for their families. They plan to use to loan to purchase tools such as compressors and grinders, summer clothing to sell, ingredients and materials to make and sell empanadas and other foods, and to repair the vehicles that are the source of income for those who work in transportation. Despite this being the group's first loan, the members are already experienced with group loans from similar organizations, so they know how to use the funds to grow their business and increase their income, which will translate into a better education for their children and a better quality of life for their families.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":478778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neidy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liceth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Banesa Fabiola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roly Ever","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Katia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Matilde","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eldy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1440.63},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1457.2},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1473.97},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1490.93},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1508.09},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1525.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1543},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1560.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":207.09},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":209.47},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":211.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":214.32},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":216.79},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":219.28},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":221.8},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":224.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":628.45,"local_amount":4371.8,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4411.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909425},{"amount":214.32,"local_amount":1490.93,"processed_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1504.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909426},{"amount":216.79,"local_amount":1508.09,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:55:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1521.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945000},{"amount":219.28,"local_amount":1525.44,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:56:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1539.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128945001},{"amount":221.8,"local_amount":1543,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1557.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673338},{"amount":224.36,"local_amount":1560.74,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1574.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136673339}],"funded_date":"2010-02-02T09:42:18Z","paid_date":"2010-06-25T07:54:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":176439,"name":"One Word Camp Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pictured here are members of the One Word Camp.

She intends to meet the demands of her customers.

It is also known as \u201cLa Ciudad de las Flores\u201d (The City of the Flowers).  This area is famous nationally for its tourist and religious festivities.  It is located 20 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor many years she has been selling flowers outside of the cemetery in the city of Ferre\u00f1afe.  She works at this business on the week-ends because that is when there are a large number of people who visit the graveyard.  This activity constitutes an important source of economic help to the family.  Her husband is a farmer, and this does not produce income in a permanent way.\r\n\r\nA few months ago Mercedes, with much effort, got a \u201cmototaxi\u201d (three wheeled motorized vehicle used to transport cargo and passengers).  She gets additional income from the mototaxi.  The vehicle is driven by her son.  He travels the city of Monsef\u00fa and the outlying rural communities offering his services.\r\n\r\nThe continual usage of the vehicle and the rough state of the roads that join the city of Monsef\u00fa with its rural communities have caused the mototaxi to start to have some problems.  These require urgent repair to make it operate correctly.  She also wants to pay for all of the documentation that permits her to legally offer taxi services.

She considers the most difficult part of her work to be the long nights that she has to work in order to fill her orders.  However, even so, she knows that this is her work and that she must get it done.  Cimi would like to add a brand name to her clothes and become well known in the market.

its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

years ago Br\u00edgida and Eleuterio, natives of Cojata, decided to come together and form their own family. As a result of their love for each other, their two children were born. With their children they parted from the land where they were born, seeking a better future. Now they live in the city of Juliaca, the place where Eleuterio offers his services to the general population as a bicycle taxi driver, his only form of work. With this job he physically exerts himself in order to sustain his family. Meanwhile Br\u00edgida dedicates herself to the sale of dress garments, a business that she has been learning little by little.

She is frequently able to predict the market\u2019s demands in each time period, so the task of investing in certain goods is constant changing.

In addition to clothing, they also sometimes sell firewood. In hopes of increasing the size of their business, the group members decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso and they are now on their third loan cycle after having properly repaid the two previous loans. The women plan to use this loan to buy 40 bolts of fancy pagne wax fabric and five parcels of second-hand clothing, commonly known as \"Yougou Yougou.\" They will buy their stock of fabric and clothing in Bamako (the capital of Mali) and S\u00e9gou from wholesalers.

However, she is still very happy doing this work\u2014as she herself says, if she stopped working she would become ill.

Fortunately business is good, and that makes her remember what it was like when she started out\u2026selling products to her children. Now she gets many orders from her friends. Elena wants to continue this progress and get further promotions, but she also knows that it will take a lot of dedication and more work. So she wants to get back into the business of selling clothes which she used to do many years ago and which gave her a better income.\r\n\r\nShe has had several loans with Kiva partner Microfinanzas Prisma, and really likes the community bank because the members are good friends and punctual in their repayments.

Por ello, trata de dedicarse a su negocio de la mejor manera, en todo tiempo del d\u00eda, dentro y fuera de su casa puesto que sus clientas siempre la visitan para adquirir algunos productos que tiene en stock. Asimismo sale a visitar a algunos clientes llevando los cat\u00e1logos para que realicen sus pedidos, lo cual le toma gran parte del d\u00eda debido a las distancias que tiene que recorrer, pero lo m\u00e1s cansado es realizar las cobranzas, las cuales son indispensables para que siga invirtiendo en su negocio. Con el tiempo, Alicia espera incrementar la cantidad de productos que tiene en stock y trabajar con varias l\u00edneas de belleza, adem\u00e1s desea tener la capacidad de implementar un bazar donde pueda ofrecer estos productos. Con Microfinanzas PRISMA ya tiene 24 pr\u00e9stamos y dentro de su banco comunal ha sabido aprovechar las oportunidades de desarrollo, junto a sus compa\u00f1eras trabajan arduamente para que sigan adelante como grupo.

She is responsible for her daughter and granddaughter, whom she tries to offer the most comfortable life she can. She has various sorts of work over the years; most recently, she has done cosmetics sales, which helps her cover her expenses. She tries to do her best at her work, at all hours of the day and in and out of her house, since her clients always visit her to obtain the products she has in stock. She also goes out to take catalogs to some clients so they can make their orders, which takes up a good portion of the day since she has to travel long distances. But her most tiring task is to collect payments for invoices, which is essential so she can continue to invest in her business. In time, Alicia hopes to increase the quantity of products she stocks and work with a number of brands of beauty products. She also hopes to be able to set up a little store in which to sell her products. She has already had 24 loans with Microfinanzas PRISMA, and her communal bank has helped her take advantage of opportunities for growth. She and her companions work hard to move ahead as a group.

He and his family live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. B. operates a cell phone and cell phone part retail business in his town. The cell phone industry in Mongolia has exploded in recent years as many people rely on their cell phones as their only means of communication with people in other parts of the country since both land lines and internet access can still be prohibitively expensive. B. began his business in 2006 and because of his strong customer service skills and stable business operation, he has become very successful. He hopes to soon expand his business further and open his own small shop where he can continue growing his enterprise.

She earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month with these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Francisca joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her third loan taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \n\n\nAbout ASKI:\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns her living through her general store and pig fattening businesses. Her husband, Simplicio G., is 61 years old. They have seven children who are between 19 and 32 years old. \r\n\r\nAurelia  joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 7 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Aurelia  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 29,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of about $210, raising the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 8th cycle loan, she is borrowing 29,500 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital to buy stock for the store and vitamins for the pigs, so that she can continue to save up for the future and improve her businesses. Aurelia G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She is married and has three children. Her husband is a head of \u201caiyl okmotu\u201d, which in Kyrgyz means a village. He is responsible for all the activities of the village, its security and the development of business. That makes Gulmira feel responsible too. \r\n\r\nGulmira is a teacher of Russian language and literature in local high school. Unfortunately, a teachers\u2019 salary is just a little bit above the minimum wage level. Because it\u2019s far from enough to make a living, most teachers look for a second job or start a small business. Gulmira saves most of her salary to pay the tuition of her two college aged children.  Additionally to her work in school, Gulmira also breeds livestock to resell. Her business was started 20 years ago with the purchase of a young calf for 5000 soms. Gulmira raised the calf and resold it, for a generated profit she bought another one. Following this strategy, Gulmira has accomplished a lot, and considerably increased the number of her cattle. Now she\u2019s built a paddock for cattle and provides good living conditions for the cattle. The purpose of the loan is to buy additional livestock and resell them at a good price. The anticipated profit will be spent on making major repairs at her house.\r\n\r\n        --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously). \r\n\r\nMBF is the only Microfinance Institute in Kyrgyzstan that delivers its services to customers 365 days a year.

That\u2019s why I always like to have a good amount of stock even if it\u2019s only a little bit of each thing, so that students and children will always find what they are looking for.\u201d\r\n\r\nTeresita needs this loan to buy pencils, pencil cases, paper in white and other colors, glue, scissors, paper board, bond paper, modeling clay, polystyrene, foam, notebooks, spiral notebooks, laminates, and biographies, to re-stock her store.\r\n\r\nVianey is another member of the \u201cColibr\u00ed\u201d group. She is 40 years old. She only attended junior high, and she is married. She has two daughters, both of whom practice dance and volley ball. \r\n\r\nShe tells us that more than ten years ago, she decided to start her own business selling cakes, bread, and flan. She sometimes sells by previous order, and sometimes she sells door to door. She explains that what helps her have good sales is having many friends. \r\n\r\nShe needs this loan to buy eggs, butter, milk, baking tins, cooking gas, flour, whipped cream, fruits, and food colorings for the preparation of her cakes. She is very happy with this loan because it will help her business to prosper.\r\n\r\nThe other members of this group are: \r\nMaria Luisa H. D. \u2013 bottled water sales\r\nIrma C.

This is Steven. He is the Head teacher of St. Mary\u2019s Primary School Lugazi, a mixed school in the Urban area of Lugazi in Buikwe with 500 students. St. Mary\u2019s Primary School Lugazi has requested a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining a UV water filtration system to provide clean drinking water for its students. The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nSt. Mary\u2019s Primary School Lugazi will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term. Steven ultimately hopes that having access to safe drinking water will improve his student\u2019s concentration and attendance by reducing the number of children that fall sick from water-borne diseases as well as increase the number of students coming to the school.

nearly 20 years, Zenobia has been buying and selling a specific type traditional dress worn by the women in the region of Ayacucho, Per\u00fa. As one walks down a street in Ayacucho, it is very common to see the women wearing beautiful, brightly colored and intricately embroidered skirts. This skirt is called a \u201ccentro\u201d and the slips that are worn underneath to add fullness are called \u201cfustanes.\u201d Zenobia has capitalized on the long standing popularity of these beautiful skirts and sells them to many clients in the area. \r\n<p>\r\nTo obtain her supply of skirts, Zenobia travels to the nearby city of Huancayo, where the skirts are mass produced. These she brings to her stand in one of the markets just outside the city of Ayacucho to sell. Because the skirts are so finely detailed and of such high quality, they are very expensive. One skirt, she explains, sells for 400 Nuevo Soles, or about $130 USD. This is so prohibitively expensive for the majority of Zenobia\u2019s, that many buy an outfit on credit or even pay her in food products, such as cereals instead of the Peruvian Nuevo Sol.  \r\n<p>\r\nZenobia explains that when she joined her village bank some 10 years earlier, she only had enough capital to request a loan of $50, an amount that doesn\u2019t even come close to the purchase of a single skirt. Today, however, after much hard work and diligence, Zenobia is able to request a loan of $500. This growth, Zenobia explains, would not have been possible without the help from her village bank. Not only has it provided her with ample economic opportunities, it has also taught her how to be a confident female leader. All this has made the support of her 5 children and husband much easier. With the $500 she is requesting, Zenobia will be able to buy more skirts in Huancayo to sell in Ayacucho. She says she is constantly working toward her ultimate goal of opening her own store in downtown Ayacucho."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":85016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy more skirts to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-11-19T02:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zenobia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-04T05:09:42Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1498,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":374.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":374.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":374.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":374.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125,"local_amount":374.5,"processed_date":"2008-01-04T10:19:27Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":374.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":108266},{"amount":125,"local_amount":374.5,"processed_date":"2008-02-04T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":374.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128259},{"amount":125,"local_amount":374.5,"processed_date":"2008-03-04T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":374.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":149307},{"amount":125,"local_amount":374.5,"processed_date":"2008-04-04T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:28:07Z","rounded_local_amount":374.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":173651}],"funded_date":"2007-11-20T05:09:42Z","paid_date":"2008-04-04T10:12:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":28529,"name":"Marie Ayawa","description":{"languages":["fr"],"texts":{"fr":"<p>Born in Lom\u00e9 on 15 September 1947, Mrs. Marie Ayawa K. is a widow and has five (5) children in her care.

Jos\u00e9 has two children: his older son is 16 and in his third year of high school and his younger son is 11 and in Grade 5.  His partner does not live with him for now because she works far from their country trying to make a better life for her children and her family.  Jos\u00e9's goal is to improve his business and create stability for his sons in their studies: because of the situation in the country, some families are removing their children from school due to a lack of money.  His dream is to start another business which will help him, so that his sons can learn to manage the business and that in the future they will brave the hard times in life.  He dreams that his wife will return to Nicaragua, that she can finally find work here and care for their children, be with her family and achieve the quality of life which they want so very much.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 has been selling groceries from his home for the past 16 years.  He started the business for his family; the grocery store was initially his wife's responsibility.  She started it with her own money and decided to buy products such as eggs, sweets, rice, oil and juices.  Her husband always supported her in managing the grocery store but she needed to make more income for her family and therefore decided to travel and look for work outside the country.  Thus, her husband took over the grocery store and has been trying to support his family with the business.  Initially it was difficult becaues he did not know much about managing the business - he had to learn to buy the goods - as well as care for his sons and do the household chores.  With time, he learned to do all these things.  He is now asking for a loan to use as working capital as he needs to buy staple goods, sweets, cosmetics and clothes.  He also wants to invest in school supplies as school will be starting soon and he would like to offer his clients a choice of products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":261737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-29T02:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose Antonio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1636.36},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1636.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.82},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.8}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.82,"local_amount":1636.36,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1647.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400012},{"amount":81.82,"local_amount":1636.36,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1647.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092010},{"amount":81.81,"local_amount":1636.36,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1647.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985393},{"amount":81.82,"local_amount":1636.36,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:10:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1647.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446008},{"amount":81.82,"local_amount":1636.36,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1647.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956649},{"amount":490.91,"local_amount":9818.2,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:13Z","rounded_local_amount":9886.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174074}],"funded_date":"2009-01-29T10:06:30Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":89992,"name":"Antonieta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Antonieta  tiene 58 a\u00f1os y vive con su esposo en su propia casa.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Jocelyn is requesting a loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. This will be her 1st loan from GDMPC.

<i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth) and embroidered cloth, over thirty years ago.\u00a0 She is much in demand, especially by her customer base (composed essentially of women), for the quality of her products.\u00a0 She receives many orders from the surrounding towns and her business is doing very nicely.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nConcerned about further satisfying her burgeoning customer base, Madougou decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso about seven years ago.\u00a0 After several solidarity loans (group loans) in a women's association in her district, she is now on her tenth individual loan.\u00a0 All the previous ones were properly repaid.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nShe plans on using her loan to buy 24 bolts of wax <i>pagnes<\/i> cloth, 18 outfits of embroidered fabrics, and 10 pairs of plastic footwear.\u00a0 She gets her supplies in Bamako (capital of Mali) and then resells them door-to-door in Sikasso and often in the towns surrounding Sikasso.\u00a0 \r\n\r\nMadougou envisions using this loan to make a monthly profit of 180,000 francs CFA, which will be used essentially to increase her working capital, to help cover family expenses, and to pay the loan interest.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She lives in Brgy. Balisong, Argao, Cebu. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her food vending, farming and sari-sari store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. \r\n\r\nShe now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6000. Marcela is now borrowing PHP 20000 so that she can have additional capital. This will be her 6th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Marcela aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She will save the profits, because through this business she wants to make her dreams come true \u2013 to have her own house and to move back to Haiti.\r\n\r\nGraciela's association with Esperanza began because she wants to improve her business and learn more about how to run a business. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti. Her group is located in the rural area surrounding La Romana, where the sugarcane harvest and tourist industry dominate the economy. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and irregular electricity.

Advantages are that it does not need a large start-up capital and there is always a high demand. While disadvantages are that most of these goods are perishable, therefore need fast sales. \r\n\r\nKanybek A., 34, is a member of this group. He is single and lives with only person who is financially dependent on him,  a seven-year-old nephew. Kanybek really wants his nephew to grow to be an independent, educated person and he does his best to provide him with all the necessities. Therefore, 4 years ago, Kanybek made his first steps into the business sphere. He used 75,000 soms of his savings to start the wholesale of consumer goods in a market of his home-town, Kerben. He plans to spend a loan from Kiva on investing in goods circulation. He expects to earn 7,000 soms per month, which will be used to make the payments for this loan, to pay health-care related expenses and to take a better care of his nephew. The remaining portion will be put back into his business. Kanybek has fought so that he and his nephew won\u2019t lack anything. He pledges to successfully repay the loan and dreams to open a chain of shops in future. \r\n\r\n      --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help Eliza continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP10,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEliza dreams to be able to give her all her children a high-quality education through all her hard work on her business.

He is on his third individual loan and the two preceding ones were correctly repaid.  \r\n\r\nMonsieur Idrissa plans to put together a big stock by buying different pharmaceutical products (medicines) with this loan. He buys his goods from the important pharmacists in Bamako and often in Koutiala if it is not a big order. He sells daily in his pharmacy at the big open-air market of Koutiala to a clientele composed of women and men, for cash and very rarely on credit. \r\n\r\nHe expects to make a monthly profit of 225,000 F CFA which he expects to use to reimburse the loan as it comes due, investing the rest in his business.

She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 22,000 loan. She will be using the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nNoselyn hopes her business grows in the coming years and and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business.

has land mainly produces rice. He uses the land to feed his three children ages 17, 13 and 11. He and his wife work in the fields everyday hoping to have a good crop yield. He will use the loan to buy fertilizer and pesticides, and will make a small investment in land preparation. He was born and raised in Baba, but he hopes his children can gain an education and move to a bigger city. His main short term goal is to make all the lands he owns productive, as certain sectors have not been prepared for farming. \r\n<\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan.

It is made by felling trees, which are then chopped into pieces. A hole is dug in the earth and a smoldering fire is set. Banana leaves are placed over the hot coals, and the chopped pieces of timber are placed on the banana leaves. On top of the timber are placed more banana leaves. The entire pit is then buried lightly with loose dirt, enough that the coals can still breath. In three days the pit is opened, and the timbers have been charred all the way through, thus making charcoal. \r\n<p>\r\nA person selling charcoal will always be needed. If he can build a strong clientele, he can operate his business for a long time. He will buy charcoal in 100kg bags and sell by 2 cups.
