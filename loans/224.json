Lourdes works selling roasted chickens from her home.  She has been in this line of work for 3 years and she tells us that she has good days and bad days.  She operates from 8am until 8pm.  This is her sixth loan cycle with her communal bank.  Loans from the foundation have allowed her business to grow a bit every day.  The new funding will be used to buy pots, cutlery, tablecloths, tables, chairs, etc. to enlarge her business and provide better service to her customers.  Her ultimate goal is to buy a car for her business.\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":440882,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy pots, cutlery, tablecloths, tables, chairs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-12-06T00:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Lourdes Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:12Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680073},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680074},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:26Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074586},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:41Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074587},{"amount":263.32,"local_amount":263.32,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:40Z","rounded_local_amount":263.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910576},{"amount":11.69,"local_amount":11.69,"processed_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:17Z","rounded_local_amount":11.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946185},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:36Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946186},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:04Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674551},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:18Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674552},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674553},{"amount":91.63,"local_amount":91.63,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":91.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708771}],"funded_date":"2009-12-11T05:23:12Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":163621,"name":"Mary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary is 46 years old, married and has two children, both of whom are in school.

She is 53 years old. Nenita is the group leader of a 2-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is chicos 3.\r\n\r\nNenita is married and has 2 adult-aged children. To make a living, Nenita owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling grocery products such as noodles, coffee, sugar,salt, canned goods,shampoo, soap and toothpaste in the local community. Nenita has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 10000 PHP per month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Nenita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Nenita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital for her business. Nenita is requesting a new loan of 6000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products for resale. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Nenita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is a single mother with a seven-year-old son named Herbin Mauricio, who is currently in second graD..\r\n    \r\nHilda is asking for a loan to stock her small grocery store, as there are a few items that she needs to restock but cannot buy at the moment due to a lack of capital. She hopes that this loan will allow her to restock the store and move forward with this venture. \r\n     \r\nHer motivation in opening the store was her young son. She needed a job that would let her proviD. for him as best she could, but also one that would let her stay near him and take care of him. The only way to do both was to start this small business. \r\n     \r\nShe has been investing her earnings in buying more items to sell at her store, so that she can offer a wider variety of goods and keep her customers satisfied. Her main goal is to see her business grow so that she can begin saving money to help her son get ahead, by giving him a good education and a bright future.\r\n      \r\nHilda became part of the \"Las Naranjas\" group through an invitation from her neighbor Vitalina, who encouraged her to join in order to be able to get the funds to fully stock her store.\r\n      \r\nThe members of the \"Las Naranjas\" group are:\r\n\r\nRosalinda Hern\u00e1ndez L\u00f3pez: She will use her loan to buy clothing, which she sells in nearby communities.\r\nMar\u00eda Vitalina S\u00e1nchez D.

She lives in Purok Kapayapaan, Barangay Luzviminda, Puerto Princesa City, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her furniture making business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of about $450. \r\n\r\nLilibeth is now borrowing 20,000 PHP so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 24th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 20,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Lilibeth hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon -- a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She comes from La Vall\u00e9e, in the Ou\u00e9m\u00e9 Department in Southern Benin. She's married and the mother of six children, and lives in Cotonou with her husband. However, she does not have to support her children anymore. Martine sells cereals (corn, millet, sorghum, rice, etc) that she gets in the surrounding villages, and that she delivers, on credit, to semi-wholesalers. She also sells palm nut oil and fresh tomatoes. To better meet customer demand, she needs more important financial means than what she has today. This is why she is seeking a loan from Kiva's partner, Alid\u00e9.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Alid\u00e9 means \u201cthere is always a path for the poorest\u201d in Benin\u2019s local language of Fon.

is sixty two years old, divorced, and the mother of seven children. Three of her children are currently in school while the other four older children work. To support them, Grace has been trading food for six years now. She always tries to maximize profit through Just In Time delivery (JIT). She trades wheat and spices such as maize and pepper in bulk.

in her father 's business, planting & harvesting taro and bananas.  She has many years of experience in this business.    Lotufou needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lotufou joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Lotufou's 1st loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from secondary\/high-school.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nZacarias is married and has four adult-aged children. To make a living, she runs a food stall, selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over six years and makes approximately $230 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Zacarias joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. She is now requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 12th loan from PMPC. Zacarias plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She and her husband share in covering the various family expenses.  \r\n\r\nV\u00e9ronique never attended school.  To meet her needs and to provide for her family, she sells a variety of food items (cookies, candy, milk, etc.) from place to place but also out of her home.  As a side business, she sells footwear.  She gets her supplies at Dantokpa, the international market of Benin.  She buys her shoes in Lom\u00e9, in Togo, a country neighboring Benin.  \r\n\r\nShe is a previous ALID\u00e9 client having already had three loans, which have all been repaid.  She would like to increase her stock of goods and to bolster her business in particular for selling shoes.

She lives in the Santa Rosa area (the central Peruvian jungle), where she has her own home.  Years ago she worked in agriculture, but she did not feel comfortable doing the work and she always liked having her own store.

She now has many customers, and her sales are very satisfactory, given the good service that she provides.\r\n\r\nSince then her sale of sweets, cookies, and soft drinks has improved over the previous year, because she always tries to keep her store well stocked.  Her point of sale is in her own neighborhood, and she works from 6:00 am to 9:00 pm.  Her future plans are to expand her business by introducing new primary need products for the home, so that she can convert the store into a bazaar in a short time.\r\n\r\nThis will be her 14th loan through MFP, and she is committed to making all of her payments.

Javier studied accountancy and basic finances when he finished his high school studies but he never worked in the profession.  He started working in a hairdressing salon and stayed there for seven years.  Later, he carried out some specialization courses in hair cutting and nine years ago he decided that it was time to open his own business in premises near to his home.  It was a complete success because he attracted the customers he had when he was an employee.\r\n\r\nCurrently, and above all to do manicures and pedicures, Javier uses the services of a young woman who he pays a percentage of his daily income.  This is the second loan that Javier has taken from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and he plans to invest the money in buying shampoo, hair dyes and hair creams wholesale.\r\n\r\nJavier's average daily sales amount to 80,000 Colombian pesos and his profit margin is 60%.  The recent winter season that hit the country led to a reduction in his income.

Josephine tries to make her pub stand out from the others in her locality by offering free DSTV and GTV entertainment to her customers. \r\n\r\nThis business can at times be frustrating. Josephine has to deal with clients who walk away drunk without paying their bills and those who get chaotic and end up breaking glass ware. This though, has not hampered her from expanding her business. She is using the loan proceeds to purchase more local brands of alcohol such as Nile, Bell, Tusker, Waragi, Romi, among others. She is saving some of the profits earned so that she can purchase a pool table for the pub to attract more customers and increase her income.

Torrechayoc II is maD. up of 8 women and 4 men, all hardworkers who always look for opportunities to improve their lives and economic situation, and through their daily efforts ensure a better future for their children.  The members live near Cusco, in the city of Urubamba, a region known for its warm climate, beautiful scenery and cattle farming. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mariela is a member of the bank.  She is 33 years old and lives with her husband Walter, who helps with the household costs.  Mariela sells wholesale groceries.  She is an enterprising woman and from the time she opened her small shop she has done well.   She has been a member of the communal bank for 2 years now, and she will use her portion of the new loan to purchase rice, sugar, noodles and eggs.  The other bank members, Edelmira, Sonia and Luz Marina are teachers.  Albino and Nayda also work selling grocery items and Angela sells vegetables.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Two other members, Milton and Inocencia, work selling bakery goods which they prepare themselves from a shop they rent.   They lived in adobe houses close to the Vilcanota river.  Due to the torrential rains which have been falling over the city of Cusco, the Vilcanota river overflowed its banks, destroying homes like Milton and Inocencia had.  They lost all of their possessions, but they continue in their work asiD. from the tremendous difficulties.   Other members are worried because sales have decreased in the wake of the rain which fell for three days in Cusco.   These members worked directly with tourists, and tourism has fallen considerably.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The members all appreciate the opportunities that the communal bank provides for them, and they have committed to comply with their respective payments on time.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Charnes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3175,"image":{"id":488851,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"The money from this loan will be distributed to various members of the communal bank.

Orocarita has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Orocarita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11000 PHP from HSPFI which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Orocarita is requesting a new loan of 14000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the fourth loan she has taken out from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nVictoria is married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Victoria operates a direct selling business in the local community, selling cosmetic products. Victoria has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately $70 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Victoria joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nVictoria is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be her 4th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. \r\n\r\nIbtesam wants to improve her home by purchasing new necessary home furniture such as bedroom furniture for her children, living room seats, and a kitchen table but she doesn't have enough money to pay for these so she needs to borrow a loan from FATEN.  When Ibtesam gets the loan, she will purchase new home furniture and be able to offer her family better and more comfortable living conditions.  Ibtesam is a conservative woman so her husband is photographed here instead of her in the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. For more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

children, the youngest of whom is 10 years old. As a means of supporting her family, Altyn started a farming and cattle raising business in 1996. She started with one cow and because of Altyn's hard work and savvy business skills she now has two cows, a calf, twenty five sheep and a horse. Altyn also grows potatoes and beans on her own plot of land. During the summer season Altyn moves with her husband out to pastures where both of them work as shepherds for the herds of their neighbors. In order to grow her own farming business Altyn has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS). She is planning to buy two more calves and fourteen sheep with this money. In the future Altyn is planning to using the profits from the loan to repair her family's home and install a steam heating system.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":933109,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Khan-Burgo village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-30T06:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2575,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Altyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":120000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":2575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1287.5},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1287.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1287.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:19Z","rounded_local_amount":60243.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070913},{"amount":1287.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T11:09:54Z","rounded_local_amount":60243.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429426574}],"funded_date":"2011-11-30T16:35:27Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T11:09:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":373260,"name":"Mujeres Unidas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"19 mujeres de Ciudad del Este se han unido con el objetivo de trabajar juntas y por medio de ese trabajo salir adelante y ayudarse las unas a las otras.

She is a proud smallholder woman who started practicing farming out of economic necessity. She learned the trade from her parents, and now she honors them by continuing it. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kakwet, Nandihills, which is in the North rift region of Kenya. Joan is happily married and is blessed with a lovely family. \n\nFor the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming. She grows maize and vegetables, and she also keeps dairy cows. Joan has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with the challenge of delivering the produce in a timely manner to the market. This challenge has not made her give up and she states \"I have to do something for my three children.\" \n\nJoan joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She requests a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Joan is from a remote village that has poor roads, and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables, and tomatoes) which require timely delivery to the market. This loan will help Joan to achieve her dream and reach her goals. \n\nFor smallholder women in Nandihills, accessing a financial solution is tough, but Joan feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva that help women. The benefits of this loan are many and one of them is that Joan will never suffer losses due to delay in delivering produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market.

He is 46, is married with five children, and lives in Saatli town in the south-central flat area of Caucasus region in Azerbaijan. Shamil owns a herd of milk cows. Every day he sells milk to the local milk processing shop. His children help him breed cows in the nearby grazing area. \r\n<p>\r\nThe income from four cows is too low to support the family, and four cows are not enough to increase the number of cows.

As a single mother, Olinda raised and cared for her 5 children.  At one time she worked for the government as a cook during the day, and at night sold what food she could cook from her doorstep.  With such hard work Olinda was able to send her children to school.  After many years, with the passing of time and now that her children are grown, Olinda would like to be a businesswoman in a market, where she sold groceries for over two years.  With the held of her son she was able to manage her business well and it grew rapidly.  Nevertheless, her children grew up and and formed her own families and could no longer help their mother with the business.  On the other hand, one of Olinda's daughters who lives in Italy has sold her mother's sweaters for her in Italian markets.  Because of this, for now Olinda will continue to knit sweaters to sell in Italy as it is winter time, and knit polos to sell during the summer.  As things are going well, soon Olinda would like to open a knitting work shop in her house so that she can produce clothing in larger quantities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jordan Shanker, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":260604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase supplies to make sweaters","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-01-26T00:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:43:52Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14854270},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:47:03Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27084878},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-29T08:17:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978320}],"funded_date":"2009-01-26T00:53:46Z","paid_date":"2009-05-29T08:17:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jordan Shanker","image":null}},{"id":89668,"name":"Elvira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvira M. is a rice grower.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He got his High School Diploma and was looking forward to going to college, but due to a lack of financial support, he had to set up a petty trade through the help of a distant relative. His business was growing gradually when a friend advised him to learn a trade out of the little he saved. He paid his fees towards a technical vocation. With the help of his younger brother, he was able to handle the business and also learn a trade. Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,157,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000.

The loan will help as it will enable him buy more stock and make profit. Changes in cost of commodities are his main challenge.  It results to decreases on sales.  He wants more financing and he is looking forward to this subsequent loan.

H. is a 61-year-old micro-entrepreneur, who lives with his wife and three children, in a rural community in Costa Rica, called Mollejones de Platanares P\u00e9rez Zeled\u00f3n. Mollejones is a community located 150 kilometers south of Costa Rica's capital, San Jos\u00e9.  It is 850 meters above sea level.  They cultivate vegetables and coffee along with other kinds of activities like raising fat cattle and pigs.  There are also some organic agricultural projects and vegetables in hydroponics. Besides agriculture, the community has mechanical workshops, a supermarket, small restaurants, and a furniture store.  \r\n\r\nHis micro-business is in the dairy field.  He produces milk and its derivatives, which he then sells to the community and the surrounding towns.  His clients seem very satisfied that they can get a hold of fresh products that are made in a trustworthy environment by a local person.\r\n\r\nHe reports that he has always had cows and calves so he knows how to care for and how to treat the animals so they produce efficiently.  However, it wasn't until five years ago that he turned it into a micro-business.   \r\n\r\nAll micro-businesses need to grow, which is why \u00a2650,000 are needed to invest in the purchase of a cow and a calf so he can increase his production and satisfy demand.  This will really help him improve his and his family's living conditions. \r\n\r\nMr. Cecilio is a client of Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Bancruce one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This is his first loan and he hopes to pay it off successfully.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva

Unfortunately in these cases, there is nobody to guide and give us sincere and correct advice or counseling. From this point, people who make these decisions themselves, relying purely on their intuitions and estimations deserve full admiration and respect. These people do not wait for the right wind, but adjust to the existing one and act accordingly. If taking risks and making tough decisions are needed, they do it, and thus prove for themselves. These types of people make a difference and deserve a different life. \r\n\r\nM. Nazgul is forty eight. She and her husband have been raising four daughters. The eldest daughter has turned twenty and the little one has turned nine. To provide for the family, Nazgul\u2019s husband works as both a cattle breeder and a farmer. Nazgul works together with her husband and helps him farm their land. They have been farming the land for the last sixteen years and have become experienced farmers. During this time they have built a home and now want to give their daughters a college education. Nazgul has applied for this loan to pay for mechanic\u2019s services and to purchase some amount of fuel. \r\n\r\nNazgul\u2019s partners: \r\n\r\nS. Orozbek, 55, is married and has four children. Orozbek farms the land and breeds cattle. His sons help him on the field and provide tremendous help in looking after cattle. Orozbek crucially needs fuel to finish farming the land. Therefore he hopes that he will be able to obtain this loan. \r\n\r\nI. Kundusbubu, 47, is a mother of two children. To make a living she and her husband are engaged in farming and raising cattle. Now, their children are studying at school, however, Kundusbubu is already thinking about her children\u2019s future. She needs a loan to buy fuel. \r\n\r\nI. Mairamkul, 34, is engaged in a guest house business. She rents a guest house and leases rooms for tourists. However, her guest houses are traditional yurts - ancient houses of nomads, not ordinary guest houses. Her monthly income is around $330. Mairamkul needs a loan to make a tent over the yurts. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

The country has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. It is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today it is home to a complex mix of Islam, Soviet culture, western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet Republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve the country's agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For the first loan, Mrs. H. borrowed 2,000,000 VND (equivalent to 125 USD) and used it to raise pigs.  She soon realized that this investment brings good profit, so she continues to use her next loans to expand her business model.  Her business is doing very good.  Each year she sells about 2 tons of pork.  Mrs. H. uses her income to save and buy some valuable furniture for the house, such as a motorbike, a refrigerator, etc.  She is planning to invest in planting fruit trees.  Since she already has a large garden, this project is feasible, and it promises to bring good profit.  Mrs. H. has 3 children who have a job and a stable income, and one young kid who is still going to school.  This time Mrs. H. would like to borrow 9,000,000 VND (equivalent to 550 USD) to continue to invest in raising animals and farming.  Her family's average income is 3,000,000 VND per month (equivalent to 185 USD).\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nN\u0103m 2002 ch\u1ecb \u0110inh Th\u1ecb H. tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9.

She had always been a housewife, in charge of caring for her four children, who are now grown and have their own families. One of her daughters followed in her footsteps, and, like her mother, sells baby clothes. These days, Nancy takes care of the youngest of her grandchildren while her daughter runs the business. She will continue doing this until he starts attending school, and then will return to her work.

In this plantation, he faces an obstacle because his field is infertile. Thus, Mrs. S. Y. decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer to support the field to make the crop more productive. She has a child who is a farmer who helps the father work.

EoT borrowers are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.

Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

She and her family live in a rented ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent, in a ger district on the outskirts of the city. She has a son, 9, and twin daughters, 7, who all attend a local secondary school.\r\n\r\nN. operates a household-goods retail business at the Bumbugur market, one of the largest and most well-known markets in Ulaanbaatar. She sells plastic and glass goods and some electronic goods used in food preparation and home upkeep. Her working capital now exceeds 2,000,000 tugrug and with the business profits, she was able to purchase a car for her husband to start a taxi service in order to supplement the family\u2019s income. She hopes that both her and her husband\u2019s businesses will enable them to have their own house in the future so that they can be more comfortable and stop renting a ger. N. is requesting an 800,000 tugrug loan in order to import more household products from China.\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009. It is the largest micro-finance organization in Mongolia, but also has mainstream commercial operations. XacBank has the vision, scale and innovation to develop and implement new solutions to poverty. It is currently utilizing Kiva\u2019s 0% lending interest rate to return 9% of interest paid from borrowers to them in the form of a savings account at the end of their loans. This not only allows borrowers to gain financially, but also encourages them to save.\r\n\r\nTo get regular updates from XacBank, please join our lending team <A

She lives and works with her husband, with whom she shares her dreams, such as having a well-stocked small business that will allow her to constantly improve her living conditions and prepare her for when they have children. \r\n\r\nShe was born in the traditional and pretty Sim\u00f3n Bolivar neighborhood of Barranqilla, where her widowed mother raised her and her brothers. Her mother had a restaurant there, but she was removed from that location. She continued the business next to the Don Juan creek and next to a dangerous garbage dump. Her mother eventually took Imelda and her brothers to their maternal grandmother\u2019s house to live, so that she could protect them and also continue with the business. The restaurant finally failed because of the constant attacks by thieves and the constant flooding from the previously mentioned creek.\r\n\r\nBecause of these problems, Imelda enrolled in university without economic support from her mother, who had lost everything. Since she had had up-close work experience, she got a job in a restaurant and later in a store so that she could pay her expenses and finish her studies. She never forgot her dream, which was \u201cTo have a well-stocked store.\u201d When she finished her studies, she married Javier P\u00e9rez, who worked in a store and shared the same dream. So, they scraped together 2,000,000 COP to rent their first business location, well stocked with snacks, staple foods, and grocery items. However, they didn\u2019t have enough to buy some types of merchandise. Now Arturo Mart\u00ednez, an advisor with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, advises Imelda and her husband. They participated in business training and received their first loan in the amount of 800,000 COP, which was gradually increased as the loans were repaid. That\u2019s how they have received two more loans, reaching the amount of 3,000,000 COP. With the loans Imelda has managed to increase her working capital and buy vitrines and shelving. They now own the store and they have a big challenge: \u201cTo buy a house so we don\u2019t have to keep moving,\u201d and to invest in improvements in a space that isn\u2019t theirs yet. In order to achieve this, the couple works hard and their love is their greatest motivation. \r\n\r\nDuring this season, Imelda planned to receive a loan in the amount of 2,000,000 COP to purchase staple foods and toys at wholesale price so that she can receive good discounts. The loan will be repaid in two months because this merchandise will be paid for up front by customers [as opposed to being paid for on credit]. This couple is an example of unity through love, persistence, and hard work.\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":452108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase staple foods and toys at wholesale price.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T08:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Imelda Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":988061},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1011939}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":494.03},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":505.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":494.03,"local_amount":988061,"processed_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":996469.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118077180},{"amount":505.97,"local_amount":1011939,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1020550.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123913403}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T12:37:45Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":167815,"name":"Santos Mar\u00eda Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nSantos Mar\u00eda Luz E.

Despite their being of inferior quality to those she produces, she is uneasy nonetheless.  For this reason, she must be constantly vigilant of the market in order to strengthen her profitable customers and not have any difficulty in marketing her products.  Another great challenge is recuperating her large commercial customers which are constantly being controlled and having their budgets reduced.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael

She is 50 years old, married, and has 11 school-aged children. To make a living, Evangeline owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Evangeline has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2006, Evangeline joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Evangeline is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This loan will be her seventh from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.
