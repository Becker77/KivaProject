She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Mainifo has 4 years of experience in this business.  Mainifo needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 120 tala or US $50 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Mainifo joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Mainifo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Mainifo T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. For more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Pero el mayor pasatiempo de ella, es la crianza de sus 45 cabezas de reses y sus 50 cuyes, los cuales los alimenta para luego vender su carne al por mayor en el mercado central de Tarma. Ahora quiere sembrar en mayores cantidades y cuidar a su pap\u00e1. Es el d\u00e9cimo cr\u00e9dito con MFP, y como secretaria de su banco comunal, se siente dichosa de poder pertenecer a una asociaci\u00f3n antigua que trabaja para el \u00e9xito de sus integrantes. De obtener el cr\u00e9dito solicitado, podr\u00e1 adquirir varios sacos de semilla de arveja, los cuales esparcir\u00e1 en sus terrenos agr\u00edcolas. \n\n","en":"58 year-old Benedicta is a courageous single mother.  She has two children who live in different parts of the country.  Benedicta lives with her dad, 83 year-old Honorato, in their own home which is located in the town of Cochas.\r\n\r\nSome time ago, this hard-working woman used to sell coca leaf wholesale, with the corresponding state license.   Now she has returned to Tarma so that she can take care of her dad who is not in good health.  She helps him with his potato, bean, pea and corn crops, taking good care of them because she knows that their profits depend on it.  Each harvest season, Benedicta takes her crops to sell in the capital.  However, her biggest pastime is raising her 45 heads of cattle and 50 guinea pigs which she feeds so that she can then sell their meat wholesale in Tarma central market.  Benedicta would like to sow her crops in larger quantities and take care of her father.\r\n\r\nThis is Benedicta's tenth loan with MFP and, as secretary of her community bank, she feels lucky to be able to work for a long-standing association that works for the success of its members.  She will use her loan to acquire several sacks of pea seed which she will sow on her land.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":685266,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of pea seed","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-04T22:30:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benedicta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":213.28},{"due_date":"2011-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":222.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":232.9},{"due_date":"2011-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":243.39},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":254.34},{"due_date":"2011-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":265.78},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":277.74},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":289.69}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.31},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.8},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.42},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.23},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.2},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.35},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.68},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.31,"local_amount":213.28,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":216.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463735},{"amount":80.8,"local_amount":222.88,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":226.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887123},{"amount":84.42,"local_amount":232.9,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:21Z","rounded_local_amount":236.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327485},{"amount":88.23,"local_amount":243.39,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:45Z","rounded_local_amount":247.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196031},{"amount":92.2,"local_amount":254.34,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":258.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269716},{"amount":96.35,"local_amount":265.78,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:13Z","rounded_local_amount":270.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549725},{"amount":100.68,"local_amount":277.74,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":282.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718410},{"amount":105.01,"local_amount":289.69,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":294.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349965}],"funded_date":"2011-01-05T05:30:46Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":267117,"name":"Khem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khem P. is a married woman who has always done housework as a daily routine.

Muyassar is 41 years old and lives with her husband and two children; having a stable family life makes her very happy. She dedicates her time to growing tomato and onion, hard work that she performs with her husband on their small farm located away from their home. They have been farming for 20 years. Farming takes up most of her day, for this reason she organizes her time so as not to neglect her children. \r\n<P>\r\nMuyassar is worried about the price increase of the fertilizers and other products that help to get good yield from her soil. Muyassar\u2019s goal is for her children to become professionals, this is the reason for her earnest work. The proceeds from the loan that she is currently requesting will go toward for the purchase of good quality seeds and fertilizer which will increase her production and make it more profitable. \r\n<P>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<P>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Despite these difficulties, Sofia and her group have found stability in their loans and look forward to continuing to develop their businesses and community.\r\n\r\nSofia will be using this loan, her ninth with Esperanza International, to buy additional merchandise for her store, including bread, juices, and soft drinks. She said that before having loans, it was easy for her and other group members to fail in their businesses because they did not have enough cash flow.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting breadfruit for sale.  Tenisi has 5 years of experience in this business.  Tenisi needs a loan of WST $750 to purchase land to raise additional crops.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 120 tala or US $50 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Tenisi joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Tenisi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Tenisi A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.89 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.99 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.99 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at: http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

She is married to Amancio S., a shoemaker, and they are blessed with two children. She makes sure to help her husband earn an income so that their family can have a better life.  She has been managing her own variety store for 12 years\r\n\r\nDolores has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than two years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with previous loans, she has been able to borrow three times from CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she uses the money she borrows to buy stock for her business and help her husband in his shoemaking business. Both their businesses combined let them earn a profit of PHP 18,000 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, Dolores would like to apply for a PHP 8,000 loan.

The official name of this borrowing group is Merlie L.'s Group.\r\n<br>Merlie is 59 years old, married, and has seven adult-aged children. To make a living, Merlie owns and operates a general store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Merlie has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Merlie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Merlie is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be her second from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI<b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Because of its profits, she has been able to support her family\u2019s needs. Being a good mother, Helen has always wanted to support her children in whatever career they would be taking to better their own personal life.  Aside from Helen\u2019s fishing business, financed by the loan she received from ASHI, she also has a farming business.  This is her way of saving her profits to support the needs of her family, especially to pay for her children\u2019s education until college.\r\n\r\nHer husband\u2019s support of her fishing business is Helen\u2019s inspiration to keep growing her business despite the challenges of poverty.  Over time, Helen has been able to purchase a fishing boat for her husband to manage and use for fishing.  Meanwhile, Helen is the one who sells his fish directly to people in local community and nearby town of Jala-jala, Rizal.\r\n\r\nWith that, Helen is requesting a loan from Kiva lenders to be able to purchase additional fishing equipment to catch more fish to sell and support the maintenance of her family's farming business. This would help their business grow, and make more profit, which will enable her to support her ambition in life.\r\n\r\nHelen has been an ASHI member since 2005. Her family is very thankful that she has an opportunity to improve their standard of living through the income of the fishing and fish selling businesses she has established with the support of the loans she has requested.\r\n\r\nThe attached picture of Helen was taken July 14,2010 with her supportive husband, Jesus S.

I., 69, lives in the municipal seat of Axochiapan, Morelos, M\u00e9xico.  She did not finish elementary school.  She is going to use the loan to stock merchandise in her footwear sales business.  She sells women\u2019s and men\u2019s shoes on Saturdays and Sundays in Axochiapan\u2019s main square.  She has had this business for three years.  She used to sell food in the same stand in the market but she was told that selling shoes was a better business and she decided to change the nature of her business.  Her son helps her by taking her to buy shoes in Le\u00f3n, Guanajuato, M\u00e9xico.\r\n\r\nShe started the business investing the money she had saved in a tanda (an association formed upon a core of participants who agree to make regular contributions to a fund which is given in whole or in part to each contributor in rotation) and set up shop in her house.  She decided to invest her money in shoe sales because she commented that she\u2019d rather earn profits with her money than spend it.  Her favorite part of the business is watching her money grow rather than spending it and that she can run her own business.  Some of the challenges she has faced is the increase in competition because there are a lot of shoe stands in the market.  Besides, sometimes the inclemency of the weather prevents her from selling.  She will use the Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad loan to buy more shoes in a style that people will buy more of.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rosal\u00eda M. is married.  Her husband is a farmer.  She has ten children.  All are married and living elsewhere.  No one else lives in her house and no one in her family helps her with her business.\r\n\r\nShe likes her community because that\u2019s where she was born and the people are kind and know each other well. Her business has helped her get ahead with her household expenses and to enlarge the business.  Plans for the future include planting some farmland she has in the local farming area.\r\n\r\nShe is happy to get help from Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad to reach her goals.  Her words for the Kiva team are the following: \u201c\u2026I thank you for the loan that you give us (sic) and for taking care of us so that our business grows\u2026\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":685043,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" To buy shoes, boots and sandals for women and men.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"AXOCHIAPAN MOR.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-05T00:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":188.27,"local_amount":2259.19,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:34Z","rounded_local_amount":2307.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430813},{"amount":125.06,"local_amount":1500.68,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1532.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850066},{"amount":125.06,"local_amount":1500.68,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1532.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292340},{"amount":61.61,"local_amount":739.45,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":755.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160598}],"funded_date":"2011-01-07T22:21:45Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:09:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":267133,"name":"Gantulga","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gantulga is 46 years old and lives with his wife and two children in Arhangai province in central Mongolia.

Emelia L.'s group is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase canned goods, noodles, soft drinks and bread for sale. This will be her first loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nEmelia is the leader of a 3 member group accessing a loan offered by GDMPC.

She is a kind, sympathetic and pleasant young woman. Hurmatoy enjoys helping people and considers it her calling. That is why she studied to become a doctor. For four years already, she has been working as a doctor in a local hospital. Hurmatoy\u2019s work is very important since she is responsible for people\u2019s lives. \r\n\r\nAlthough she spends a lot of time at work, Hurmatoy still tries to devote enough time to care for her mother. Hurmatoy lives with her mother alone. The only source of income for the family comes from Hurmatoy\u2019s work. Her mother and she had been saving money for renovations for a long time, but being unable to save enough, they postponed the work. Then winter came and it was very cold, forcing Hurmatoy and her mother to struggle to keep the house warm. As a doctor, Hurmatoy cares for her mother\u2019s health and doesn\u2019t want to face the same difficulty during the winter again. She is not going to postpone renovations any further, which is why she requested a loan.\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1894355,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to renovate the house","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Qubadiyon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hurmatoy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":271.32},{"due_date":"2015-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":280.99},{"due_date":"2015-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":294.98},{"due_date":"2015-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":294.29},{"due_date":"2015-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":321.9},{"due_date":"2015-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":323.52},{"due_date":"2015-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":332.51},{"due_date":"2016-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":351.36},{"due_date":"2016-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":359.6},{"due_date":"2016-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":367.03},{"due_date":"2016-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":390.97},{"due_date":"2016-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":411.53}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.09},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.94},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.82},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.31},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.57},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.03},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.1},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.44},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.64},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.53},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Idaliya Grigoryeva","image":1834671}},{"id":993241,"name":"Grupo Yoxaja Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda es una mujer de 40 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltera con una linda familia de tres hijos de las edades entre  diecis\u00e9is y veintitr\u00e9s a\u00f1os,  esta familia vive en una comunidad de Solol\u00e1.\nMar\u00eda para obtener sus ingresos y mantener a su familia se dedica a la producci\u00f3n de caf\u00e9, esta humilde actividad lo realiza ella desde hace 20 a\u00f1os, ella tambi\u00e9n se dedica a la venta de banano por quintal.

Shahodat is 52 years old. For fifteen years Shahodat has been working as a market vendor. She sells plates and dishes made in an oriental style in the central local market, which are very popular among the local populace. This kind of china is also widely used for girls' dowry and also for family celebrations. Now Shahodat is planning to enlarge the range of goods she sells by purchasing more china. Hence, she is requesting 2,000 Somoni. Shahodat is an existing IMON client with good credit history, and promises to repay the loan promptly. She thanks everyone supporting her.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road. It has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities who still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Till today, it remains a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. Civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous with only 7% of the land being arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural and manufacturing sectors, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Nafanua has many years of experience in this business.  Nafanua needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 1050 tala or US $438 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nafanua joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Nafanua's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Nafanua B. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<em>\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History<\/em>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She runs her own business buying and selling consumer products. The past loan made it possible for her to buy merchandise in the quantity she wanted. She was able to repay the loan on time and her business has done well, but has taken a small loss due to the drop in value of the Rand (the currency used in South Africa, which is where she purchases the majority of her products). With the revenue she earns from her business, she has been able to improve the financial situation of her family. <p>\r\n\r\nThe previous loan was for 25,000MT, and she used this amount to purchase food products and diverse clothing, which augmented her quantity of stock. The loan was satisfactory, and improved her life, and her daughter was able to get married. In the future, she hopes to access more loans to further improve her business, separating the clothing store from her food products. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michelle

Little by little she has been able to obtain a greater list of clients. She works from 6 in the morning until one of her children arrives and afterwards she sells jewelry until 2pm. With this loan she wants to buy more costume jewelry such as necklaces, chains and tinned goods for her business.\r\n\r\nIn the future Luz wants to move her business to the gold sector because of the delinquency that exists. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane McCrory, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":566573,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase necklaces, rings and canned goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Paraiso)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-07-15T06:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Felicidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":65.07},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":75.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":76.61},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":78.76},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":80.21},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":82.07},{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":84.57},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":98.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.07},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.35},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.61},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.76},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.21},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.07},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.57},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65.07,"local_amount":65.07,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":65.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845917},{"amount":72.93,"local_amount":72.93,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:19Z","rounded_local_amount":72.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172112191},{"amount":75.58,"local_amount":75.58,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:56:08Z","rounded_local_amount":75.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405599},{"amount":76.61,"local_amount":76.61,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:05:35Z","rounded_local_amount":76.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182544070},{"amount":78.76,"local_amount":78.76,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":78.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188680824},{"amount":80.21,"local_amount":80.21,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:44:07Z","rounded_local_amount":80.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191379159},{"amount":82.07,"local_amount":82.07,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-23T08:19:45Z","rounded_local_amount":82.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195797149},{"amount":84.57,"local_amount":84.57,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:22:46Z","rounded_local_amount":84.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201239323},{"amount":85.93,"local_amount":85.93,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-16T08:05:39Z","rounded_local_amount":85.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206105773},{"amount":98.27,"local_amount":98.27,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-20T07:51:37Z","rounded_local_amount":98.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211862544}],"funded_date":"2010-07-18T21:24:34Z","paid_date":"2011-06-20T07:51:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane McCrory","image":240040}},{"id":217976,"name":"Barselisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Barselisa is a young mother who aims to become successful someday by developing her farming business.

She will be glad if her loan request is granted and she will use the loan wisely by purchasing necessary agricultural supplies to maintain crop production. Her hard work and patience are her foundation in achieving a better life. In addition, the income Barselisa gets from her business is very helpful in supporting her business and sustaining the needs of her family, especially in providing school allowances for her two children. \r\n<br>Someday, Barselisa hopes to expand her farming business. She is glad for the secured opportunity of taking this loan and for your support and encouragement.

It's for this reason she started looking for ways to earn income to support her four children. Her husband is a driver, and he gave her the money to start a business selling new clothing. She started out with little money but then was able to grow her income thanks to a loan. She has benefited greatly from her investments from the loans from Kiva partner Afodenic, increasing her clothing sales out of her home. With this new loan she plans to purchase a variety of clothing for adults and children in different styles, as well as undergarments for women."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":637373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a variety of clothing to keep growing her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-11-13T04:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Johana Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50.14,"local_amount":1055.59,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T09:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1089.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189098407},{"amount":47.29,"local_amount":995.61,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T00:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1027.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191348975},{"amount":48.84,"local_amount":1028.21,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:06:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1061.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195766646},{"amount":47.59,"local_amount":1001.85,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:57:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1034.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201209691},{"amount":47.87,"local_amount":1007.71,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T09:58:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1040.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206078496},{"amount":47.71,"local_amount":1004.49,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:21:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1036.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211147551},{"amount":47.79,"local_amount":1006.18,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1038.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216433085},{"amount":47.88,"local_amount":1007.95,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:05:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1040.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221598069},{"amount":47.63,"local_amount":1002.8,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:10:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1035.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226967793},{"amount":42.26,"local_amount":889.61,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:08:24Z","rounded_local_amount":918.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232726490}],"funded_date":"2010-12-01T00:36:50Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T08:08:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":250764,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine T.  is currently in the business of selling various items in the shop such as sugar, cartons of salt etc. and is requesting a loan to stock more bags of sugar, rice and beans to sell.

He lives with his wife and their small daughter, along with two sisters and three cousins, in their own home. The work that David does is typing documents into the computer. At the same time, he also offers transportation services on his moto-taxi, which he was able to buy with his savings. He gets up to work these jobs at seven in the morning, and at the moment he works alone. He is happy with what he is doing since it allows him to have an income and, thanks to that, he can cover the household costs. He has plans to expand his typing business as he\u2019d like to offer photo-scanning services since, in the area where he lives, he\u2019s the only business that offers that services. This will be his second loan with MFP, and he feels very happy with his communal bank as he considers the members to be responsible and compliant with the payment of their loans. He will buy a new scanner and pay for repairs to his moto-taxi with the loan he\u2019s asked for."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":908556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Computers","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy a scanner and to pay for repairs to his moto-taxi.

She sold her goods on the street and different parts of the market.  After receiving a loan of $150 she slowly increased turnover, Bizulaiho started traveling to nearby markets to buy her stock as well as purchased a permanent stall in one of the biggest markets in the city. She also was able to add children\u2019s clothing to her assortment.  Currently her assets are up to $600.

She started with a loan of 30USD to buy and sell agricultural products.  She spent most of the profit from that loan on her everyday living expenses, and was able to save a small amount.  After three years borrowing from TYM Fund, Mrs. B. has gained more confidence to borrow more money to buy old barrels and discarded plastic, etc to sell to recycle companies.  From bare hands, Mrs. B. is now an owner of a recycle store where she has three employees working for her, each gets a wage of 60 USD per month.  Each month Mrs. B. earns about 375USD.  Thanks to the loan from TYM Fund, she was able to build a convenient, three-storey house.  She would like to borrow 950USD to buy van to transport garbage.      \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb D\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb B\u1ea3y, 47 tu\u1ed5i l\u00e0 th\u00e0nh vi\u00ean tham gia Qu\u1ef9 t\u1eeb n\u0103m 1997.

This is 43-year-old Mariam A. M., married with four children between the ages of 20 and 26.

Mariam thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":248907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

Using her savings, she started to travel to the neighboring town of Istaravshan to buy clothing to sell at the local market of Isfara. Little by little she increased the number of clients and expanded her business. Nevertheless, presently her selection of garments is poor and therefore she requests a loan of 2500 Somoni to be repaid in 6 months.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and is where the rule of Alexander the Great ended.  It is famous for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language,  and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\n<p>But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Remie is helping her husband earn a living for their family through her small business. \r\n<p>\r\nRemie is a college graduate with a degree in education.  However, she prefers to be a full-time wife and teach her children good values, as well as establish her own business.  Her pig pen is located at the back of their house. She has been managing her enterprise for almost four years.  Her business has provided her family with their basic needs and at the same time assisted her husband in sending their children to school.  \r\n<p>\r\nRemie maintains her hog raising business for the future of her children. In order to further develop her hog raising, Remie is asking for a loan amounting to PHP 15,000.00 that she will use to buy some piglets.  She dreams that she can buy a jeep for a transport business someday and that somehow her children will finish their college educations.

She has four children between the ages of 10 and 18 who are currently in school. She studied until the 7th grade and was forced to stop due to pregnancy. When she got pregnant she moved in with her husband. The couple had three more children before she was left by her husband and forced to find work.\r\n\r\nCacilda started selling used clothes and saved up enough money to buy a piece of land on which to build a home.

They meet every thirty days at the home of se\u00f1ora Dagmar in the community of Hospitalpampa. The communal bank \u201cVirgen Asunta\u201d is made up of 10 members.  \r\n    \r\nThe members make their livings in retail trade.  Among the members of this bank we have Ger\u00f3nima, who makes her living selling firewood; Teresa who makes her living processing and selling yogurt; Silvestre who makes his living building houses; and Marylin buys and sells grains.  They are worried because they aren't able to sell their products due to the heavy rains that lasted for several days.  The rains raised the water level of the river, which moved the bridge over which they cross from the community of Izcuchaca into the city of Cusco; therefore, there is no way across.  The members cannot bring their products to sell in the different cities of the Department of Cusco, but they managed to sell their products once an alternate route to the city of Cusco was opened.\r\n\r\nThe member Dagmar is 44 years old, is married and comes from the city of Calca.  She has five children and currently lives in the community of Hospitalpampa.  She is a working mother who managed to open a small business buying and selling foodstuffs.  Sra. Dagmar needs the loan to increase her business's capital and purchase more sugar, rice, noodles, sodas and many other products.\r\n\r\nOur members are grateful for the opportunity provided and promise to make good on the various payments in the established time periods.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marni Siegal, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1950,"image":{"id":489791,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"The member, Dagmar, needs to loan to increase her business's capital by buying more sugar, rice, noodles, sodas and many other products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Izcuchaca - Anta - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-02-23T00:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1950,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Geronima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvestre","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marilin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cinthia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Dagmar Margot","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Urbano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naciancena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":844.26},{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":878.04},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":913.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":949.69},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":987.68},{"due_date":"2010-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1027.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":293.98},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":305.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":317.97},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":330.7},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":343.92},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":357.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":294.02,"local_amount":844.37,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:19:00Z","rounded_local_amount":846.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128905975},{"amount":305.79,"local_amount":878.18,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":880.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633446},{"amount":318.02,"local_amount":913.29,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:49:06Z","rounded_local_amount":915.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144667868},{"amount":330.74,"local_amount":949.81,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:24:15Z","rounded_local_amount":952.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151851530},{"amount":343.96,"local_amount":987.78,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:13:58Z","rounded_local_amount":990.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159589887},{"amount":357.47,"local_amount":1026.57,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1029.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166800707}],"funded_date":"2010-02-28T14:17:46Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T09:40:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":180978,"name":"Kanchan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Kanchan K. is a resident of Sainbu-Bhaishipati, which is one of the developing villages of the Lalitpur district.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband Cesar, who is 52 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have one child who is 12  years old.\r\n\r\n Chelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Chelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000, which she intends to use to fund the operations of her business so that she can continue to save up for future education of her child.\r\n\r\n Chelita A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

After working for several years as an apprentice, he started his own diesel oil retail business. Today he is a seasoned reseller with 10 years of experience in the field. His high sales volume is due to his good understanding of how the sector works.

The purpose of this loan is to expand and build a kiosk for her business, to buy more products and display them properly.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jeanette Chase, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":234173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Build a kiosk to sell her products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-07T19:30:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":223.91},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":232.04},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":242.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":257.8},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":265.29},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":278.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":74.64},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.35},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80.94},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85.93},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":74.64,"local_amount":223.91,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:19:45Z","rounded_local_amount":230.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957765},{"amount":77.35,"local_amount":232.04,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":239.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228015},{"amount":80.94,"local_amount":242.83,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:04:41Z","rounded_local_amount":250.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423247},{"amount":85.93,"local_amount":257.8,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:43:40Z","rounded_local_amount":265.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116503},{"amount":88.43,"local_amount":265.29,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:45:27Z","rounded_local_amount":273.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011446},{"amount":92.71,"local_amount":278.13,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:20Z","rounded_local_amount":286.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595070}],"funded_date":"2008-12-08T07:31:40Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeanette Chase","image":829647}},{"id":81960,"name":"Pedro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Pedro se dedica a la cr\u00eda de ganado vacuno, cuya producci\u00f3n de leche lo comercializa a PIL Andina (Planta Industrializadota de Leche).

Ugiloy is 39 years old, married and the loving mother of four children. She is a vendor and for the last thirteen years has been selling cottonseed oil at the local market. In the traditional Tajik cuisine the majority of meals are fried or cooked using cottonseed oil. Our national dish \u201cOshi palov\u201d especially uses a great deal of cottonseed oil to make it delicious. So the goods that Uguloy sells are in great demand by the population. Today she is planning to increase her business and for this reason she has requested a loan of 3000 Somoni for the term of twelve months. The loan will be used to purchase more cottonseed oil in order to increase her inventory. Ugiloy is counting on your help and thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was a key post along the Silk Road and is where the rule of Alexander the Great ended. It is famous for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 53 years old, and is married with 7 children between ages 7 and 22.  Her children attend public schools in Boane.  She also supports one of her nephews who lives with her.  She attended school until the third grade during the colonial era, but stopped when she became pregnant.  Later she enlisted in the armed forces of the national liberation, for independence from the colonial yoke.\r\n\r\nShe lives in her own home with her family (husband, children, and nephew).  She also cares for her mother in her home.\r\n\r\nShe left Tete in 1981 for Boane, alone, to meet up with her husband who was in the military.  Mariana was also in the military, and fought for independence along with her husband. Both she and her husband receive a pension from the Ministry of National Defense.  They met in the military before the end of the war.  Each of them receives 5.740.00MT monthly, totaling 11.480.00MT, which they use to support their family and for construction of a cement block home.\r\n\r\nMariana had loans with other similar institutions and said that she heard about Hluvuku-Adsema through two neighbors who were clients of Hluvuku-Adsema and found the payment method to be democratic (the client defines the monthly payment in accordance with his\/her ability to pay and can pay off the loan early without any penalties).\r\n\r\nThis will be Mariana's second loan, in the amount of 12.000,00MT for the purchase of construction materials (cement, sand, etc.).  Her first loan was for 10.000,00MT for the same purposes. \r\n\r\nShe plans to pay back the loan without any problems in order to have access to additional loans to finish her home and strengthen her business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva

Married to Jovencio C., a taxi driver, she makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life.  She has been direct selling branded clothes and managing her own variety store for five years.\r\n\r\nElsa has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than three years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow nine times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to buy stocks for her store. Her two businesses let her earn a profit of PHP 5,500 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying assorted snacks and beverages for her store and additional products for her direct selling business.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will grow so that her youngest child can finish college and help all her children improve their lives. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":479273,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She works in the family hardware business that her parents started more than twenty years ago. She learned all about the business as she grew up.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago she decided to become self-sufficient and sell hardware at the same stall as her parents. This allowed her to pay for her studies. But she also has plans to expand and have her own stall.\r\n\r\nCurrently Susan\u2019s goal is to obtain different types of hardware using her own money such as plaster, bolts, and pipe connectors. She believes that the loans she obtains from Kiva partner MFP are very important for her business as they allow her to gradually increase her working capital.

She lives in the small agricultural town of Balubad in Silang, Cavite together with her husband and children. She is 25 years old. Nelylyn is a multi-micro-entrepreneur with a farming business on their small parcel of land as well as a small junk shop. She has been successfully juggling the operation of both businesses while raising her three children. She is a natural businessperson, with the nose for potential transactions and a heart for clients. She is also a loving mother with a big dream for her family's future.\r\n\r\nHer farming business grows vegetables such as lettuce and mustard, and fruits such as bananas and coffee. She changes produce according to the season so the business always has income. Her husband helps her with the farming, but Nelylyn operates the junk shop on her own. She travels around the town in her tribike buying scraps and bottles, and almost anything that can be resold to recycling factories. From the junk shop, she earns a monthly income of P2,000, a small amount for so much effort.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy organic fertilizer for her vegetable farm. She will also be using some of the loan to buy more scrap for her junk shop.\r\n\r\nNelylyn is a member of Center for Community Transformation (CCT), a Filipino family-oriented and Bible-centered development organization that provides and creates equal business opportunities for small-scale Filipino entrepreneurs through loans and social interventions.

Ram\u00edrez is 41 years old and married.  She lives in the San Miguel Xico settlement, which is in the Chalco Solidaridad Valley in the state of M\u00e9xico.  She has four children; two of them are school age.  Her husband is a bricklayer.  To get other income she started working with another woman selling snacks.  At that time this really helped because her earnings helped her husband with the school expenses for her children.  It seemed that all was well.  \r\n\r\nIn time she started to feel bad, and she went to the doctor.  They told her that she has a severe infection that is affecting her kidneys, and she needed to be in treatment.  Not having medical insurance, the costs elevated.  She did not have economic resources, so she looked for medical alternatives.  It was this activity that helped in the recovery of her health as much as economically.  A relative lent her a little money, which served as her first investment.  Then she got customers.  Now she needs money to be able to increase her investment.  She has greater earnings, which will help her to remodel a space in her house.  This will serve as the place where she keeps and sells her products.  Her earnings will pay for the education of her two children.  She is like the other colleagues who come together in a group to request a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad.

He now has sufficient income to support his children, who are in school. His children also help serve customers in their free time, and his wife helps prepare the dishes they offer. Ruben has many goals for the future; one of them is to buy a larger kiosk so that he can satisfy more customers with his delicious daily meals. With the funds from the loan, he will buy a refrigerator, so that he can keep his products fresh. He is a responsible and hard-working young man with a great desire to improve his life, and he is very grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the confidence placed in him in granting the loan.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":524923,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buying a refrigerator","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T21:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruben ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":5600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":450.34},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":431.02},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":441.97},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":465.94},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":479.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":499.32},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":523.74},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":541.61},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":566.35},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":587.4},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":612.81}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.58},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.14},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.56},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":74.82},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.37},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.91},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.92},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":125.91,"local_amount":881.36,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":883.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144696957},{"amount":63.14,"local_amount":441.97,"processed_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":442.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151879992},{"amount":66.56,"local_amount":465.94,"processed_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:51:38Z","rounded_local_amount":466.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159620017},{"amount":68.5,"local_amount":479.5,"processed_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:03:34Z","rounded_local_amount":480.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166834445},{"amount":71.33,"local_amount":499.32,"processed_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":500.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172100884},{"amount":74.82,"local_amount":523.74,"processed_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:38:53Z","rounded_local_amount":524.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177393684},{"amount":77.37,"local_amount":541.61,"processed_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":542.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182532106},{"amount":80.91,"local_amount":566.35,"processed_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:56:01Z","rounded_local_amount":567.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188668691},{"amount":83.92,"local_amount":587.4,"processed_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:58:50Z","rounded_local_amount":588.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191412144},{"amount":87.54,"local_amount":612.81,"processed_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-25T09:15:31Z","rounded_local_amount":614,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195830608}],"funded_date":"2010-05-26T12:35:01Z","paid_date":"2011-03-25T09:15:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":197541,"name":"Las Mercedes Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Claribel is the coordinator of her group, Las M., and her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients generally (many of whom recently emigrated to the Dominican Republic from Haiti).
