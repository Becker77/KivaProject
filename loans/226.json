Philip works as a peasant farmer for a living. His community of Kamaena A village does not have access to clean water. The water that is used for drinking and cooking is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases. Philip is a friendly member of the community, and has been elected Promoter by his village to help its members obtain safe drinking water.\n\nAs a volunteer Promoter, Philip represents the community on Kiva\u2019s website and educates the community on how to protect their families from unsafe drinking water by using a chlorine dispenser system. Philip and another promoter in his community, named Jeniffer, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Philip wants to be a promoter because he believes that the dispenser system will prevent water-borne diseases.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Philip\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1804357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To reduce the burden of water-borne diseases by providing access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Philip","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeniffer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":894593,"name":"Ezekiel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ezekiel is a Babban Gona farmer from Pegi Vilage.

has lived in this house for eight years.

When we asked her husband about who helps whom in the family, he stated that it is he who helps her, as her business is smaller than his.\r\n<p>\r\nJulia's business is selling clothing which she normally buys in the capital, Santo Domingo, where there is a secondary market for the Haitian packs (\"pacas\") of new and used clothing that are sold in the border towns, which become major  trading markets between Haitians and Dominicans at the beginning and end of the week.  As the majority of the Haitian people are very poor, they get donations in the form of new and used clothing.  They pack these into \"pacas\" and bring them to the border in order to convert the goods into money they can use to buy food and other necessities.  Their Dominican counterparts take this opportunity to purchase goods at discount prices, so that they can in turn use these low-cost (usually high-quality) products for sale back in their hometowns. \r\n<p>\r\nJulia doesn't have the opportunity to make the long trip (usually a whole day) to the Haitian border. because the trip to Haiti is expensive.  The cost runs anywhere from $25 to $30 in public transportation (roundtrip).

He makes a living by traveling and selling craftwork like handmade bedspreads and tablecloths, embroidered by the women of Carapegua, an activity that is typical in the region.

Dionisio would accompany him to make his sales, and this is how he learned the trade and got to know various places that now constitute his work area.<p>\r\nOne of the most difficult experiences he has had was when it was discovered that his mother had a very serious illness and needed a very expensive treatment.  Because of this, Dionisio traveled to Argentina in search of better work opportunities.  He returned several years ago, and with the little savings he had, he bought merchandise to sell once again, traveling to different places and cities.<p>\r\nDionisio needs this credit for the purchase of bedspreads, tablecloths, embroidered napkins, and shirts, among other things, to make wholesale sales of them, since the demand for these products had increased in the last few months. <p><b>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><\/b>\r\nDionisio es oriundo de la  compa\u00f1\u00eda Tayy Loma de Carapegu\u00e1   tiene 36 a\u00f1os  de edad es soltero  sin  hijos y vive  s\u00f3lo. <p>\r\nSe dedica a la venta ambulante de artesan\u00eda como sobrecamas  y  manteles artesanales, bordados a mano por las mujeres de Carapegua y cuya actividad es t\u00edpica de la zona.

Jungie has been engaged in his business for over 10 years and earns approximately 20,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Jungie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jungie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 40,000 PHP from GDMPC.\r\n\r\nJungie is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Jungie from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

For the past few years, this has been her source of income. She is 44 years old and has two handsome sons. Her husband works in agriculture, and he provided her with the funds to get started with her work. Later, she chose to take out loans in order to invest more in her business and travel to the market. One of the difficulties she faces is that corn sometimes becomes expensive; she has to raise the price of her product, and her sales fall, throwing her business a little off balance. With the loan she is requesting, she will buy ingredients to continue preparing her products, such as corn, shortening, cane sweetener, cheese, sugar, and firewood, among others. She will also carry out repairs to her oven, since it currently needs maintenance; she has not built another one as she had earlier planned. Her goals include helping her sons complete their level of study and expanding her sales for greater profits. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Salohiddin is 29 years old. He is married with two children. Salohiddin is dedicated to his agricultural business. Having little knowledge in the beginning, he had to learn a lot about farming. As of now, he has acquired a fair experience in agriculture.  Salohiddin is very happy, for his 2 children who are the motivation for his desire to grow his business. He approached IMON International to obtain a loan to buy more ingredients; seeds and fertilizer. This will enable him to sow for a good harvest and to take care of his children and his home.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

M. is a 33-year-old man, married, with one child. Julius lives at Mlolongo, an informal settlement along the Nairobi \u2013 Mombassa highway. Apart from caring for his young family, Julius has the burden of taking care of his brothers and sisters after losing both of his parents.<P>\r\n\t\r\nJulius started his restaurant business in the year 2006. This was after he and the other employees he worked with were sent home after the chain of supermarkets they were working for came under receivership. Since Julius had experience in dealing with customers while at the Uchumi supermarket, his former workplace, he decided not to waste his skills. He therefore ventured into the restaurant industry, where he felt that he could make use of his skills while at the same time earning some money for the upkeep of his family and siblings.  <P>\r\n\t\r\nIn order to finance the start-up of his business, Julius sold one of his cows for a total of Ksh 18,000 (US$ 300) and put this amount in, together with his personal savings of Ksh 40,000.00 (US$ 670), which he had put aside while still in employment. With this, he opened his business in the year 2006. The business has since been doing very well, and Julius now feels that he wants to improve the business by adding on some kitchen equipment. This will include a cooker, a refrigerator, a French fries warmer, a juice extractor, a blender, and some cooking fat. These will enable him to give his clients quicker and better service. <P>The population within the Mololongo area is rapidly growing and Julius wants his business to grow with the rising number of potential customers.

She is a very hard working woman. She has a shop repairing mopeds and her husband is a barber. She has 2 children who are also employed, and thus her family's income is quite stable at 12 USD per day. She and her group have gone through 2 loan cycles and have repaid the loans. She likes this loan program because it allows her to repay gradually, and at the same time allowing her to save extra cash to assist her children. For this loan cycle, she wishes to borrow 280 USD to buy spare parts to sell and to use in her repair shop. In her group, there are the following members:\r\n\r\nMs. Dang Thi N., Ms 01030001, loan amount 280 USD to invest in her business of selling and repairing telephones;\r\nMs. Le Thi Quy, Ms 01030003, loan amount 280 USD to invest in her shop selling breakfast food;\r\nMs. Dang Thi Ngoc T., Ms 01030005, loan amount 280 USD to buy supplies for repairing calculators;\r\nMs. N.

Since it is hard for her to survive without a stable job on her own, she decided to engage herself in piggery business, a business that she initially considered only a hobby.  She started her business with just one sow. To her surprise, she was able to manage it well and use it to finance her daily needs with the help of Paglaum Cooperative. She was able to avail herself of different types of loans, and paid them religiously.

Jes\u00fas de 7 a\u00f1os y Joshua de 5, en su  casa que es de material noble (cemento) y se  aprecia que  ha sido levantada con mucho esfuerzo, adem\u00e1s tiene el orgullo de decir que es propia. Ella es una mujer muy trabajadora que se dedica a vender gas en su casa desde hace 4 a\u00f1os, pues percibi\u00f3 que en su barrio no hab\u00eda quien abasteciera de este hidrocarburo a las diversas familias, desde entonces, se desempe\u00f1a en este oficio junto con su esposo. Empez\u00f3 solo con 3 balones de gas y poco a poco se ha ido comprando m\u00e1s. Merly tambi\u00e9n se dedica a lavar ropa de otras personas durante  las ma\u00f1anas, con ello tambi\u00e9n obtiene otros ingresos econ\u00f3micos. Y como si fuera poco, al caer la tarde se va al muelle que est\u00e1 cerca de su casa y ah\u00ed vende papas rellenas de carne, que por su exquisitez es uno de los platillos t\u00edpicos del Per\u00fa. \nLa venta de gas es un negocio, seg\u00fan ella,  rentable ya que no hay nadie por su casa que le haga la competencia y porque conoce a sus vecinos a quienes a veces suele darles cr\u00e9dito. Para el futuro, como est\u00e1 refaccionando partes de su casa, piensa poner  una ferreter\u00eda, ya que tambi\u00e9n se ha dado cuenta que no hay alguna que cubra las necesidades de su barrio. Para esto ya tiene una vitrina, que est\u00e1 guardada, hasta concretar su sue\u00f1o. Merly siempre se proyecta al futuro y dice \u201cquiero poner un gran letrero, que se vea desde muy lejos y vender varios materiales en mi ferreter\u00eda que por ac\u00e1 necesitan\u201d.\nYa ha tenido 3 pr\u00e9stamos con MFP y siempre ha sido muy puntual; adem\u00e1s le gusta el trabajo de su banco comunal, ya que est\u00e1 conformado por se\u00f1oras muy responsables a las que conoce desde hace mucho tiempo. Con el dinero que solicita comprara m\u00e1s balones de gas y tambi\u00e9n empezar\u00e1 a comprar mercader\u00eda para lo que ser\u00e1 su futura ferreter\u00eda. \n\n","en":"Merly is 32 years old and lives with her husband, Nicol\u00e1s, and their two young children, 7 year-old Jes\u00fas and 5 year-old Joshua. They live in a concrete house, which was raised with a lot of effort, and she is proud to say that is their own.  She is a hard-working woman who has sold gas from her home for four years. She began the business with her husband when she realized no one in her neighborhood supplied gas to the various families there.\r\n\r\nShe began with only three tanks of gas and little by little has bought more.  Merly also washes clothes in the morning to gain secondary income. As if it were not enough, at dusk she goes to the pier close to her house to sell meat-filled potatoes, a typical Peruvian food.\r\n\r\nAccording to Merly, selling gas is profitable since there are no other businesses competing against her and she knows her neighbors to whom she sometimes occassionally loans.\r\n\r\nSince she's redoing part of her house, she is thinking about putting in a small hardware store after realizing that there is none to cover the needs of her neighborhood. She already has a glass case that she is saving to use when she realizes her dream.\r\n\r\nMerly always looks towards the future and says, \"I want to put up a big sign that you can see from far away and sell various materials in my hardware store that they need around here.\"\r\n\r\nShe has already had three loans with MFP and has always been punctual with payments.  She likes to work with her community bank since it is made up of responsible women she has known for a long time. With the money requested she will buy more gas tanks and begin to buy merchandise for what her new hardware store.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lydia Brantley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":403500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increasing merchandise and investment for new business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-11T10:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Merly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:44Z","rounded_local_amount":252.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997649},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:13Z","rounded_local_amount":252.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843001},{"amount":262.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":757.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734577},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:43Z","rounded_local_amount":252.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992513}],"funded_date":"2009-10-11T14:32:41Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lydia Brantley","image":null}},{"id":147263,"name":"Kiganda Nanono Prosy Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

FigueR. is an enterprising, 40 year-old woman who lives in Universal neighborhood, in the city of Barranquilla, together with her three daughters and a grandchild.  Mabel's business is selling fast food.  She sells hot dogs, burgers, trays of French fries with sausages and rolls filled with cheese, chicken and ground meat.  She runs her business from her home on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.  Her work day starts at 4.00pm and lasts until midnight.  Mabel's two eldest daughters help her in preparing the food and serving customers.  She started her business 3 years ago on the recommendation of some of her neighbors who know how good she is at cooking.\r\n\r\nAs well as running her food business, Mabel also has a family sewing machine with which she sews bedclothes and drapes to order.  This is her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she plans to invest it in buying several sets of plastic tables and chairs as well as ingredients for making her food.  \r\n\r\nMabel's average weekly sales amount to 400,000 Colombian pesos and her profit margin is 40%.  This small businesswoman's husband is in Europe and although he helps with the household expenses, the absence of a father figure is felt in the education of her daughters.  In the future, Mabel is planning to hire premises so that she can separate her business from her home and also so that she can sell meals every day.  If this project becomes a reality, she is planning to use the same strategy she has used up to now: offer excellent products at the best

The stand, which she already owns, is located near a major intersection adjacent to her property. Her ideal location offers great growth opportunity in her community, which has a population of 980.\r\n\r\nCarmen has considerable experience in the service industry, having managed a grocery store she owned with her ex-husband for 19 years. After leaving the grocery store, she worked with other service-oriented businesses but says she missed owning her own business. Just like her grocery store, Carmen plans to make <i>Chacho\u2019s Campestre Center<\/i> a family owned and operated business. She has recruited her current husband and two grown daughters to help her with Chacho\u2019s operations.  \r\n\r\nRecent illness prevented Carmen from working and depleted the financial resources needed to launch her business. She says finding a lender was the biggest obstacle in trying to open Chacho\u2019s Campestre Center. She was directed to ACCION and Kiva through her local Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. Carmen is grateful to ACCION Texas-Louisiana for recognizing her business\u2019 potential and giving her the funds needed to get started. She says without ACCION Texas-Louisiana\u2019s help, she doesn\u2019t believe her business would be possible.\r\n\r\nDown the road, Carmen would like to expand the size of her stand as well as the products it carries. Carmen believes this is an attainable goal because of her property\u2019s size and says that when the time comes it can be done cost effectively.\r\n\r\nReflecting back on her time as a grocery store owner, she attributes the success she had to the personal relationships she developed with clients. When asked the secrets to success for a customer service-oriented business, Carmen lists creating a friendly, comfortable atmosphere where each customer is treated as an individual."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2125,"image":{"id":707190,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy equipment for making and keeping food warm, e.g., hot dogs, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Clint, TX","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2011-02-05T16:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2125,"lender_count":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2120,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":151.15},{"due_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":168.91},{"due_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":168.61},{"due_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":171.79},{"due_date":"2011-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":173.52},{"due_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":176.62},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":178.57},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":181.15},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":184.12},{"due_date":"2011-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":186.42},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":189.29},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":189.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":151.51},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.3},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.01},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.2},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.93},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.03},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.99},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":181.58},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.56},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.86},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":189.73},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":190.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":151.51,"local_amount":151.15,"processed_date":"2011-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:01:23Z","rounded_local_amount":151.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195764659},{"amount":169.3,"local_amount":168.91,"processed_date":"2011-03-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T09:54:05Z","rounded_local_amount":169.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201207790},{"amount":169.01,"local_amount":168.61,"processed_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T09:56:40Z","rounded_local_amount":169.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206076693},{"amount":172.2,"local_amount":171.79,"processed_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":172.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211145762},{"amount":173.93,"local_amount":173.52,"processed_date":"2011-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:23:52Z","rounded_local_amount":173.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216431392},{"amount":177.03,"local_amount":176.62,"processed_date":"2011-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:01:18Z","rounded_local_amount":177.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221596314},{"amount":178.99,"local_amount":178.57,"processed_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-29T07:41:13Z","rounded_local_amount":178.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226966191},{"amount":181.58,"local_amount":181.15,"processed_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-28T07:40:14Z","rounded_local_amount":181.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232725028},{"amount":751.45,"local_amount":749.68,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-23T08:44:34Z","rounded_local_amount":751.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238529076}],"funded_date":"2011-02-06T16:25:36Z","paid_date":"2011-11-23T08:44:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":275036,"name":"Ekua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ekua H. is a widow supporting seven children.

H. lives in Vahdat. She is married and has 3 children. She has a community college degree. She does not have a job. She helps her husband provide for the family by selling milk. Shahlo has steady clients from whom she buys milk at low prices and then travels out of the area to re-sell it.  This is a profitable business.  Shahlo has her own cow, but the cow does not give any milk.  If she had a milk cow, her profits would nearly double and she would also be able to lower her prices. This would make the milk  she sells more affordable for the local people.  This is why she is seeking a loan of $1025 to buy a good dairy cow. She plans to repay her loan within 6 months. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Olga Espira, Kiva volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0431\u0443\u043b\u043b\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0430

It was a key post along the Silk Road and an outpost of Alexander the Great's domain. From this region sprang great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, and Mavlavi Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex amalgam of Islamic, Soviet, and modern Western influences as well as Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan's independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The two oldest go to school.\r\nJoaquim left Inhambane and went to the municipality of Vila de Namaacha at the frontier with Suazilandia to live with his sister when he finished the 8th grade, because where he was living they didn't have the next level. When he arrived to Namaacha he continued with his studies during the night. During the morning his sister got him a job in the jungle with a renewable contract every 3 months for 2 years. Years later he was a volunteer member of the organization called (OJM) Organization of Mozambique Youth and was entrusted as assistant of the administration and finances department. Since then he has been working for the past 5 years earning a monthly salary of 3,300.00MT working from 7am to 5pm and Saturdays from 5am to 6pm when there are visits from the chiefs of the state department, he receives a subside of 1,500.00MT but it doesn't fulfill his necessities so he came to Hluvuku to request a loan to start building his house and receives 12,000,00MT. He is able to save 500.00MT a month because he rents the place where he lives at 800.00MT monthly.\r\n\r\nThis is the third loan Joaquim is requesting to Hluvuku and first with Kiva. The 12,000MT will be used to buy material for construction to build the ceiling of his house, he is confident he will pay before the due date and probably by the end of the year he will be living in his own house.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Nina Delgado, Kiva

Since her parents are farmers, she learned the techniques of growing each one of their products when she was young.  For this reason she is able to grow crops of coffee, rice and beans on her own, only using workers temporarily during the times of harvesting beans.  Every three months she harvests her produce; this way it is much more profitable.  When she sells her beans she is able to earn 1500 soles; this sum is used to pay for her supplies for three months while she waits for the next harvest of her other products.  Lucy is happy that through her farming she is able to sustain herself and ensure that her son does not want for anything.  This is her third loan with MFP; she mentions that she feels very comfortable and accustomed to all of the members of her communal bank.  In addition, she is very grateful for the trust that she has been given in obtaining consecutive loans.

The main source of income for the business comes from providing hairdressing and beauty services to local community members. Rovelyn has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 25,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2009, Rovelyn joined Kiva partner GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from GDMPC. Rovelyn is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase equipment to improve the business. This loan will be her fourth from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

The five older ones are adults and the two younger ones attend school. They live together in their own house located in a neighbourhood of Ayacucho. When he was 9 years old, he used to help his parents sell fruit, but when he was older he learned a new trade and became a farmer. For that reason and because he now has a family, his job is growing and selling cocoa and citrus fruits. His business is doing well.\r\n\r\nHis wife and children often help out, but generally he needs assistance from farm labourers to bring in the harvest.

He has a stationary stand where he sells cookies, sweets, cigarettes, soft drinks, and juice.  He also provides cell phone call service.  The business is located in the Chapinero neighborhood close to the Fanny Mickey National Theater.  The theater is famous for putting on the best theatrical shows and musicals in the country.\r\n\r\nThis small businessman has been located in the same site for 26 years.  He is widely known by the workers and people who frequently pass by the area.  He is friends with almost all of his customers.  He chats with them about the day\u2019s news while he sells them refreshments or gives them a match to light a cigarette.  When he sees a suspicious car or person, he does not hesitate to tell the private watchmen in the buildings that are nearby.  He does this so that the watchmen can report it to the police.\r\n\r\nHis work day starts at 8:00 a.m., and it ends at 7:00 p.m.  He got his propensity for business from his father.  In the beginning his father sold lottery tickets.  Later, his father had a stand similar to the Jaime\u2019s stand in the same area of Chapinero.  Six siblings of Jaime are also merchants.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He plans to use the loan to buy wholesale cigarettes, chocolates, and cookies.  This way he gets important discounts for paying in cash and buying in volume.  His average daily sales are 150,000 COP; and his profit margin is 35%.\r\n\r\nIn the future Jaime wants to rent a place to continue his business and to sell breakfast and lunch.  This project will allow him to increase his sales and improve his work conditions.  He sometimes suffers due to inclement weather like the recent winter season.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this small businessman says that he is a happy man.  Together with his business, he is part of the landscape in Bogota.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":684071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy wholesale cigarettes, chocolates, and cookies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-01-03T15:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T09:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":65828.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427767},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:47Z","rounded_local_amount":65828.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001206},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":65828.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289229},{"amount":33.72,"local_amount":61314,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":64578.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157367},{"amount":35.03,"local_amount":63686,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":67077.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230377},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:12Z","rounded_local_amount":65828.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509241},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:25Z","rounded_local_amount":131656.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673462}],"funded_date":"2011-01-03T23:32:48Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":266857,"name":"Elvis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elvis vive en alquiler en la zona de Villa Dolores, de la ciudad de  El Alto, tiene dos hijos, el se\u00f1or es chofer taxista, con los ingresos que obtiene se mantienen; en anterior cr\u00e9dito realiz\u00f3 el mantenimiento de su movilidad.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History: Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Express Auto and Body Paint, because he wanted to provide reliable service to his community while providing secure employment to its hard-working members. Before opening his shop, Raul worked as the manager of the paint department at a large auto shop. However, after being forced to lay off many of the employees under his charge, Raul decided to go out on his own. \r\n\r\nA.R.C. Express Auto opened in September 2010 and offers its customers any auto body service from dent repair to complete paint jobs. Raul used his 10 years of experience, including time working with the U.S. Army, to start the business. He hired and receives ongoing support from three of the employees laid off by his old employer, including an old manager who helps Raul estimate paint and labor costs. \r\n\r\nRaul says his biggest success to date has been keeping the business open and successful while navigating a confusing city-permit process, which nearly led to the close of his shop. Of this, he says, \u201cIn order to keep your business legal, you need to get the right city permits. I would call in and get a different answer from each person regarding these permits. Ultimately, I had to pay someone to figure it out for me because I couldn\u2019t start the shop and engage in that process at the same time.\u201d  Since he started the shop with his personal finances, he said that the strain caused by this added necessity nearly forced him to shut down the business.\r\n\r\nHowever, his loan from Kiva partner ACCION Texas-Louisiana helped Raul overcome this difficulty. He used the loan to make payroll, pay for paint and supplies, and pay off a mortgage on some land, which has since been sold and the money brought back to his business. Without the loan, Raul says, \u201cI would have had to shut down the shop. ACCION Texas helped me see the options available to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the future, Raul hopes to stay true to his community-oriented business policy. He says, \u201cMy goal is to hire some disabled veterans and people with disabilities and give back to the community. My goal is not to get rich; I want to give people a workplace where they come in, enjoy what they do, and go home happy.\u201d  He says that one day he hopes to open another establishment, such as a dance hall, that community organizations can use at an affordable price for recreational functions.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly a year in business, Raul offers the following advice to aspiring business owners: \u201cMake sure you do your homework, and, most importantly, make sure you engage with your customers and the people who affect your business face-to-face.\u201d  With this loan, Raul was able to overcome the initial challenges of opening his business. Now, he can continue to give members of his community a secure job that provides reliable, quality services to the residents of El Paso.

A few years ago, Amable was diagnosed with diabetes, which has affected her productivity and is the reason she now finds herself without sufficient capital to invest. Instead of giving up, she has decided to develop new ideas, like producing bedspreads, curtains, bath mats and other items requested by her customers. As she doesn't have the necessary funds to buy materials, she needs a loan to continue with this project and to increase production, as well as to remodel her kitchen, an aim she shares with her

She was born and was raised in a 100% agricultural and livestock farming family. After many years of learning, she has acquired a lot of experiential knowledge that has been quite effective when it comes to taking care of her farming activities, especially raising small farm animals.  She is a woman with a good sense of humor and lots of optimism in life.  These qualities made her a key figure in her family during times of hardship and lack of money when they lost their crops after a huge cold wave that affected their harvest. They also had to endure other difficult decisions as a family.  Currently she has big projects in mind; she is planning to venture into planting peas and she is preparing her land for crops. In the meantime she is firmly dedicated to breed small farm animals such as hens and guinea pigs in order to support her family, while her husband works as a mason.

Along with her husband they support their 7 children, who are still in school and require a lot of financial support. Thanks to the purchase of a house, they are no longer paying to rent a home.  Due to the size of their family, Dina decided to help out her husband with the expenses and find a way to generate income.  Thanks to the help of one of her neighbors, she was put in touch with workers who requested a meal service. For three years now she has cooked lunches for her customers during the week and she charges them at the end of the month.  She enjoys this work, as she only has to spend the morning preparing meals, to later be delivered, and she has the rest of the time to dedicate to her children.  \r\n\r\nHowever, Dina would now like to work full time and in order to accomplish this she plans to open a restaurant in a market or commercial space, where, along with her children she can invest time and money to make it successful.

It is a purely agricultural area located an hour from the city of Chiclayo. \r\n\r\nHe has been mainly working in agriculture and ranching since childhood. He currently is raising sheep and pigs, which are then sold at the market in Moshoqueque in Chiclayo. This business is one source of income for his home, but does not provide the stability to keep them going.  This is why he has turned to another activity which he has worked at for 18 years: fishing.  During the fishing season he travels with his brothers to San Jose creek to catch fish and then sell it to his neighbors. The area where he lives is far from the sea so this business is very profitable. \r\n\r\nAurelio is thinking about devoting even more time to his fish business and plans to buy more fish. In addition to selling to his neighbors he would like to sell in the surrounding areas. For this reason he is applying for the first time to Edpyme Alternative for a loan of 1000 nuevos soles. \r\n\r\nHe is hardworking and has previously worked as a taxi driver and has always studied how to make electrical connections and bathroom fittings. He is always thinking of ways to support his family and takes advantage of every opportunity presented to him. \r\n\r\nHis greatest dream is to secure a source of work that would provide the stability for his family that they need to succeed. He also dreams of traveling to Spain to work and from there support his family. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Machelle Wilson, Kiva

She married young and has a 14 year old son, who is in school. She started a small mobile business selling fruits and vegetables, and with her husband's help, she was able to set up a small shop, which she has been running for 3 years. She also sells firewood, which her husband cuts down on their land. He is a farmer and rents land to cultivate. He grows beans and tomatoes and with this he supports and helps his family with their needs. Because of a lack of capital, they have not been able to increase their inventory.

She is 43 years old and sells \"nacatamales\", a local food made with pork, dough, spices, potatoes, rice and others (similar to a tamale). She normally sells them on weekends. At first she butchered the meat but it took a lot of effort si she decided to purchase it instead to prepare the product.\r\n\r\nIsabel sells her \"nacatamales\" in Tipitaba since there is more competition. She dreams of opening a small shop. She has five children.

Mejorada in the district of Mariscal C\u00e1ceres in Huancavelica. Situated on the right bank of the Mantaro River, at an altituD. of between 2600 and 3600, the community has a mild climate and can be accessed from the towns of Huancavelica and Huancayo by both rail and road. Farming (cereal crops, potatoes, beans, vegetables); animal husbandry (sheep, cattle, and young animals); as well as commerce and tourism are the main activities. \r\nTeresa A. is married and has eight children. She began her business 8 years ago with a small amount of capital, but because of health problems, she lost everything. She began selling meals and opened a small store that she still runs. With the loan that she receives, she plans to increase her stock. Now she not only sells from her store but also from a stall that she has in a school. Her dream is to see her children become professionals, especially her four youngest children as the older ones are married and she does not have the means to have them study.\r\nPaulina S. is married and has five children. She started work with FINCA six months ago when she invested her first loan in the purchase of guinea pigs and chickens. Beforehand she could not sell anything because no one would lend her money, whereas now she buys and sells young animals. She has succeeded in increasing her income and now has no problems putting bread on the table. Her dream is to save enough to buy a plot of land so she can live there with her mother-in-law.\r\nSaturnina F. is married and has four children. In the past she used to wash clothes for a living, but now she sells anticuchos (type of kebab) and fried foods. She used to have problems with her husband because he drank too much, but now he has work, and so she has been able to overcome her difficulties. With the loan she has managed to buy a kebab stand, and now she earns more than before and has more money to spend on her children. Saturnina\u2019s plan is to save money so that her children can lead happy lives and lack for nothing\u2014especially where their education is concerned.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":213239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"The Bank Lucero del Amanecer needs 5100 soles so that its 13 members can invest in their businesses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-10-16T07:30:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela Catherina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina Leona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benedicta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Helga Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saturnina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ayda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fausta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-30T17:36:29Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T04:11:32Z","rounded_local_amount":861.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5314864},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:46:14Z","rounded_local_amount":861.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9932484},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":861.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10214779},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":861.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20396509},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":861.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088288},{"amount":279.15,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":861.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35981822}],"funded_date":"2008-10-16T17:36:29Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T16:13:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":73476,"name":"Mavlyuda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Problems and money shortages never defeated Mavlyuda, who has always looked for a way to get past obstacles and continue to improve her situation.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is 36 year old Naomi D. from Mwanza.  She is married. She is also responsible for supporting two orphan dependents. Naomi has been running a poultry business since 2008. D. has a Poultry\/kuku business. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially among SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. She works at the business for 4 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Naomi currently earns about 160USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400USD in order to buy chicks to raise and resell. In the future, she plans to expand her business. D. thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy more chicks raise and resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naomi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027589},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613590},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010669},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:13Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232955},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664746}],"funded_date":"2009-03-09T22:23:22Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave Gibbons","image":608904}},{"id":98052,"name":"Mari","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mari M. is twenty-eight years old.

her business. She will use this loan to purchase flour and fish, as well as to cover transportation and rent costs.   \r\n \r\nThis is Mercy\u2019s third loan from GHAPE since she became a beneficiary in 2007. Mercy trusts her business will be a successful one because she thinks she has a good site at which she operates her business. Her customer base is also consistent and Mercy is skillful in her activities. \r\n\r\nLike most entrepreneurial mothers, Mercy plans to use the profits from the loans to pay for her children\u2019s school fees. The profits will also go towards purchasing food and clothing for the family. Mercy enjoys being a GHAPE member and likes the group of entrepreneurs she works with. \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":363348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fish and flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Alabukam, Mankon, NW.

It is thanks to this support that they have improved their incomes and consequently, their quality of life. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":666960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cooking oil, drinks, canned goods, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Villarrica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2010-12-16T13:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosmari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grisel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nilda|","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eduarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Iris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":8085695,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":505355}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.93},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.93},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.93},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.93},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":665.63,"local_amount":3032136,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3061875.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188690118},{"amount":1109.37,"local_amount":5053559,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":5103124.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191429368}],"funded_date":"2010-12-17T04:33:21Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:40:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":262793,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gladys tiene 53 a\u00f1os, vive con su hijo en la casa de un familiar.

With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Zoraida has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.
