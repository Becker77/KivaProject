She works everyday in her small caf\u00e9 located within a children\u2019s playground (at a kindergarten school) near her town. Every morning she serves her young customers and the teachers of the school. She offers candy, drinks and food, and on some occasions her children help her with the work. It makes Sofia really happy to be with her children and to generate economic earnings to provide for them. Her future projects are to continue advancing this business, improving her sales and earnings a little more each time. This is her second MFP loan. During this period of work she has demonstrated being punctual and responsible in her loan payments. Today she promises, once again, to continue her positive attitude.

Merlina is requesting a new loan of 4,000 Philippine pesos, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the first loan taken out by Merlina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":443774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

He graduated in 2007 as computer repairman from a vocational training center, an affiliate of The Mongolian University of Science and Technology.

She is single and is the mother of 4 children who are 15, 17, 21, and 24 years old.  All of them go to school.  She only studied through the 6th grade and did not continue due to a lack of financial resources.  She lives in her own house with her children and does not support anybody else.\r\n\r\nShe has never left Boane.  Sabata has had her own business for more than 10 years.  She does not have any employees and earns about 3,500 MZN per month, which she uses to pay for expenses.  She is even able to save some in her bank account.\r\n\r\nSabata has had loans with other banks, but she later decided not to continue on with them.  She found out about Hluvuku through her neighbor, who has already received a loan through this institution.  This is her 4th loan, which has a value of 20,000 MZN.  She plans to use it to buy construction material (sand, cement, stone, iron, etc.) to expand and improve her home.  The previous loans were for 2,700 MZN, 6,000 MZN, and 15,000 MZN, which she put toward her business and her house.\r\n\r\nShe promises to pay back the loan on time so that she can receive others.  In the future, she plans to request more loans in order to finish and furnish her house, so that her family can have a more comfortable place to live.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

be some proper conditions. Those conditions can be summarized as availability of water pipes, roads and electricity. If there are not such facilities, people are faced with the everyday hard work of bringing water in carts and building all water providing systems themselves. The heroes of our story are people who overcome these difficulties everyday, and continue to work hard in order to earn their daily bread. \n\nDilaram K. is 49. She has raised six daughters. Her husband works in the Water Supply Department and obtains a monthly salary of 3,000 soms. Dilaram grows cotton and sells it in market. Two of her daughters are married and live with their families. The rest of her daughters help Dilaram at the cotton plantation. Dilaram\u2019s monthly income constitutes around 7,000 soms. This business has allowed Dilaram to marry her daughters. Now, Dilaram needs a loan. She needs to buy mineral fertilizers and therefore hopes to obtain this loan. In the near future, she plans to purchase cattle for breeding. \n\nDilaram\u2019s partners:\n\nMamurahan M., 41, is a mother of three children. She is engaged in cattle breeding and selling milk. Her son helps her to look after the cattle. Her husband is also engaged in some business and manages to earn 4,800 soms. Mamurahan would like to increase the total population of livestock. She needs a loan to purchase sheep for feeding.\n \nAbdimutalib A., 48, is a father of two children. His eldest son is 17 and his little son is five. To provide for the family, Abdimutalib is engaged in growing cotton and corn. His monthly income is 2,100 soms. Abdimutalib has applied for this loan to purchase mineral fertilizers and use the rest of the funds to complete the construction of the house.\n\nDildora T., 20, is single. She is preparing for marriage. Dildora is going to work after the wedding. She hopes to obtain this loan and use the funds to prepare her dowry.\n \n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\n\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\n\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Although her work is informal even so she is known by the people and they place orders for whatever article of clothing they need like jackets, sweaters and pants because they are located in a place where the temperature drops now.  She\u2019s been in this line of work for four years and what she likes best about it is chatting with her customers.  But now, her greatest priority is increasing the merchandise she has.  However, in order to sell she has to cover long distances to seek out customers.  But she\u2019s willing to face whatever sacrifice is necessary in order to reach her goals.  Because of this, she\u2019s asking for a small loan from you to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nThis is her second loan with MFP and she\u2019s determined to pay her installments on time like she did with her previous loans.  She is a very well liked and respected member of her communal bank.  She will buy clothes to increase the amount of merchandise she has.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":782770,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy more clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-31T19:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":119.19},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":126.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":129.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":136.36},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":141.82},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":146.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.7},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.3},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.14},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.18},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.06}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":44.7,"local_amount":119.19,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:46Z","rounded_local_amount":123.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550447},{"amount":47.3,"local_amount":126.13,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:04Z","rounded_local_amount":130.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719123},{"amount":208,"local_amount":554.68,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":575.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350587}],"funded_date":"2011-05-31T21:46:15Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":308274,"name":"Angela Milagros","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora \u00c1ngela es madre soltera y tiene 2 hijos de 14 y 17 a\u00f1os de edad ambos est\u00e1n en edad escolar, angela tiene una peque\u00f1a bodega de golosinas y productos de primera necesidad, como arroz az\u00facar aceite entre otros ,en sus inicios su bodega era peque\u00f1a y ahora esta un poco mas surtida, angela eligi\u00f3 este tipo de trabajo para estar cerca de su familia, ya tiene 1 a\u00f1o laborando en esta actividad , el dinero del prestamos ser\u00e1 invertido en ampliar su negocio comprando productos como gaseosas, golosinas, arroz, fideos, aceite, az\u00facar, entre otras cosas, el sue\u00f1o a futuro de la se\u00f1ora angela es agrandar mucho mas su negocio para que con ello le genere mejores ingresos y as\u00ed mejorar su calidad de vida, angela esta muy contenta con la confianza que se le esta brindando.","en":"\r\n\u00c1ngela is a single mother of two children who are 14 and 7 years of age and still school aged.  \u00c1ngela has a small store selling snacks and basic need items like rice, sugar and oil, among others.

During the first several years, she borrowed money to invest in breeding pigs. She and her husband also worked for the brick factory to repay the loan weekly. She always chose the loan that she could be able to repay. Besides using her income from the brick factory to repay the loan weekly, she also used it for family living spendings. For every farrow of pigs, she also got a decent amount of money. As time goes by, her family economy improves. Since the local economy also improves and many households invest in pot plants, she switches to this activity. So far, her greenhouse has more than 200 plants. She wants to borrow 375 USD to buy more fertilizer and pots. She hopes to get 600-800 USD the next time she sells her plants.  \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb N., 41 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 t\u1eeb n\u0103m 1999.

She\u2019s already been doing these activities for one year; she\u2019s open for business everyday, all the time. What she likes about her work as a grocer is that she gets to interact with lots of people. Giving them good service is essential, Elida mentions. The profitability of her business illustrates that Elida is the only person in the neighborhood that has a grocery store, a competency that she didn\u2019t have before. In the future, she wants to build a minimarket, thus enabling her neighbors to have their daily needs met. This is her first time requesting a loan with MFP, and in the short time that she\u2019s interacted with the community bank she\u2019s noticed tremendous unity.

C. and his family are originally from Oaxaca. Since childhood he has helped his mother milk cows for the family's business making cheese and cream.\r\n\r\nAfter school, Flavio and his brothers would help his parents sell the cheese at workers' quarters in nearby ranches. In their town there wasn't much opportunity to advance, so Flavio decided to start a new life in Mexico City and launch a business, helping him learn more and gain experience in making and selling cheeses. He dedicated himself to the distribution of his products in the community's street markets. Flavio gets up at 4:00 a.m. to make his cheese, cream and other dairy products to sell daily. Also, once a week he delivers his Oaxacan merchandise: cecina (cured, smoked meat), mole (chili sauce with chocolate and peanuts), chorizo (seasoned pork sausage), totopos (tortilla chips), tlayudas (large, crunchy tortilla topped with refried beans, meat, cheese, and salsa), chocolate, etc. For this he asks his brother who lives in Oaxaca to send him the above-mentioned products. \r\n\r\nTwo years ago he had an accident; a trailer hit him and for a year he was disabled and lost everything because he couldn't work. Now he has re-started his business and thus decided to start a lending group with his wife and mother and request a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad A.C. to be able to buy raw materials (rennet, salt, calcium, titanium preservative, propane, cans) and Oaxacan products. His sales are already growing. Flavio longs to advance himself and give his 4 children better opportunities.\r\n\r\nGroup name: Las Pe\u00f1itas\r\nNumber of members: 3\r\nRequested amount: 15,000\r\nDisbursement date: July 7, 2009\r\nMember names:\r\n Rosa Mar\u00eda C.

He is requesting a loan to purchase the materials necessary for shoe-making.

She is forty-eight years old and lives in the city of Balykchi together with her family.  Balykchi is one of those cities previously considered to be one of the growing cities; however, due to the breakup of the USSR, it began to lose its potential and became a \u201cdead\u201d city over the course of fifteen years.  Syrga\u2019s husband had to leave the city because there was no realistic possibility of finding work.  He now works in Bishkek.  He was able to start his own business and is involved in reselling cars.  Syrga stayed in Balykchi.  The children were young, and Syrga stayed home with them.  Thanks to her husband\u2019s business, they bought a house ten years ago.  Syrga quickly realized that while they had the means, she needed to build a store and begin sales.  Thus, Syrga was able to start her business.  Currently, she sells refreshments, candy, smoked fish and other food products.  Just in a month, she is able to earn up to ten thousand som ($230).  Syrga\u2019s children already grew up.  The oldest son is sixteen years old.  He will soon be graduating from school.  The youngest daughter is nine years old.

Roselieta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Roselieta is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which she will use to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be Roselieta's fifth loan from PMPC.

En adelante, espera comprar nuevas tierras para incrementar su producci\u00f3n.

Currently those fields are farmed and are more productive than before because as time has gone by he has learned how to obtain larger production of coffee, cocoa beans and coca leaves.\r\n\r\nWhat he enjoys most about the work is the close relationship he has with the soil; he also very much enjoys watching his plants grow.  He has been in this line of work for 40 years and considers the most difficult part of it protecting his fields from the inclement weather because any distraction can affect the crops.  In the future he hopes to buy new fields to increase production.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP.  He is very happy to get it because he urgently needs it to improve his business.

Every day Pedro rides through the streets in his neighborhood and nearby villages to sell his delicious \"Raspao\", which is what it is called.

Olga is married and she and her husband support their children.  She has had 7 loans which have helped her improve their quality of life.

Prohok is made by using small fish as an ingredient for soup. Roast Beef with Prohok is an exceptionally delicious menu in Cambodia.

Seven members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. These members are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.

Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time.

She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Nofo has 4 years of experience in this business.  Nofo needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Nofo joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Nofo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Nofo L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is 24 years old. Jenilyn is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by GDMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Millions.\r\n\r\nJenilyn is single and has 1 infant child. To make a living, Jenilyn owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting, harvesting, and selling bananas, root crops, corn, and coconut. Jenilyn has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Jenilyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jenilyn is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase harvesting equipment. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Jenilyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She prepares and sells the food from home.  She\u2019s been in business for four years and has done very well in her business.  Her work schedule is Tuesday through Saturday from 6pm until midnight and on weekends this schedule can lengthen.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy building materials and supplies to furbish her locale in her yard so that she can get the corresponding health permit.\r\nHer goals are to put her business in optimal conditions so that she can be open all day since she\u2019s only able to operate at night now because she lacks the permit.  Besides, she hopes to remodel the locale so that customers can consume their food there.\r\n\r\nAna lives with her husband and 3-year-old son.  Her dreams are to make her business more lucrative so that she can also hire personnel and become economically independent.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to Fondo Esperanza.  She enjoys participating in the meetings very much because of the good relationship she has with the other communal bank members.\r\n\r\nColina is a commune in the north part of the metropolitan region (where Santiago, capital of Chile is located.)  It is currently the focus of important investments especially in agro business due to the arrival of large and important firms which, by the way, generate a large number of jobs in the community.  It is also an area of \u201cparcelaciones de agrado\u201d (farmland turned into residential use) that has contributed significantly to the population increase.  In addition, it has places that are ideal for tourism, like hot springs, sports at Piedra Roja Lagoon and

She and her partner have 7 children, all grown and independent.  He suffers from epilepsy and no longer works.  \r\n\r\nTo earn enough to support them both, Benedicta operates a business raising and selling chickens and pigs.  She tells us that she buys the animals when they are young, the chicks from a supplier in Portoviejo and the piglets from a local market or from neighbors.  She keeps the pigs for three or four months until they're ready for market.

She is married to a businessman, and has four children aged 13, 9, 7 and 2 years. Three are in school.\r\n \r\nIn 2007, Humu established her vegetable oil, toys, and jeans business. She began her business because she had lived with her stepmother, who did not allow her to attend school, but instead forced the family to sell for her.  Humu did not finish her primary education and joined her stepmother in doing business.  It made her independent. That\u2019s why she likes doing business. \r\n \r\nHumu works 7 days a week and 11 hours a day and earns about Le 2,168,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 3,000,000. Humu requires a loan in order to purchase 25 containers of vegetable oil @ Le 120,000. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 326,000. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Humu plans to open a provision shop and a savings account.   She wants another shop to display her goods, as she needs a larger space to operate her business.  She wants her children to be important people in society. That\u2019s why she needs additional capital to help her boost her business. \r\n \r\nA rise in transport costs and the rainy season are her major challenges.  The competition is low, as two people are dealing with the same product but Humu has a larger stock.  She is hardworking and honest.

One is in primary school the others are still at home.  He started his chicken business in 1996 in which he gets his stock from his local Myanga market then sells at Kandui trading center. Through his business, Protus has been able to develop his farm by adding cattle  and goats, and to open up a small hotel in the Mayanja business centre to diversify his business this year. <p>Most of the challenges he faces in his chicken business is when he purchases sick chickens without knowing it, and the transportation costs, which are very high in the area due to his movement to selling areas.

With a loan valued at 2,500.00 sols, to be repaid in 6 months, she will purchase a variety of groceries, such as boxes of soap, dishwashing detergent, several brands of bleach (marsella, bolivar, jumbo), etc., 50-kilogram sacks of rice, packaged toilet paper, canned fish, liters of oil, 20-packs of salt, packaged pasta and plastic bags of different sizes for different uses. She is 63 years old and lives with her husband. She has always stood out as a fighter, a hard worker, responsible and perseverant, and she would like to add plastic products to her inventory.\r\n<b><p>Translated from Spanish by Joanne Egnatchik, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p> \r\nLa se\u00f1ora Maya es socia del banco comunal \u201cLos Jazmines\u201d, se dedica a la venta de abarrotes y bolsas de pl\u00e1stico en el puesto de venta del mercado de abastos de la ciudad de Moyabamba, distrito y provincia de Moyabamba, departamento de San Mart\u00edn.

She works in a multi-grade school in the zone of Comalapa. She leaves her home at 6:00 a.m. and returns at 4:00 p.m. On some days, she returns later because she goes to a program of Education for Adults. She has been working as a teacher in a rural zone for 20 years, and has 5 children, 4 of whom are independent, have jobs and help her now and then. Two of them live with her, as well as her youngest daughter who is in elementary school. She feels very happy as a customer of AFODENIC, because she has always made her payments on time and she is sorry that some teachers are organized in the group called \"Movement of No Payment\", because they are affecting her credit rating and bringing shame to honest teachers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Eliana Colunga, Kiva

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":364429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more materials and equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-08-06T03:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jenipha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:41Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105847},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:31Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022957},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:38Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868198},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:29Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757394},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:27Z","rounded_local_amount":105880,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146488}],"funded_date":"2009-08-07T20:49:58Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"June Blender","image":123338}},{"id":131291,"name":"Afia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Afia is 48 years old.

His house is made of cement but only has electricity and water as basic utilities. His wife helps him in the ice cream shop and they have two children.\r\n<p>\r\n These days Pablo is working in the Gino ice cream shop (an Ecuadorian ice cream shop). A few months ago, he asked to sell Gino ice cream, when he received authorization he invested his salary in ice cream. \r\n<p>\r\nNow he sells the ice cream in his house with the help of his wife.

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative. She is consistent in paying her dues. She uses the money she borrows to expand and improve her businesses.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 13,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business. She will be buying more quantities of the products in her current product inventory so that she can replenish her stocks and maintain operations of her businesses.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 10,000 to buy fishing gear and equipment so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Vivian is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

In 2007, Sullay established his motor spare parts business which includes tyres, brake pads, fan belts, batteries, windscreens, inner tubes, motor oil, etc. He began doing business when he was a small boy for his mother. When he became mature, he started his own business. \r\n\r\nSullay has a special interest in business because the income he gets from this business is used to provide his family's livelihood.  It is from his business proceeds that he has bought a car and two pieces of land. Working six days a week and 10 hours a day, he earns about SLL 1,000,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan of SLL 3,000,000. Sullay requires a loan in order to buy 10 lift pumps, 50 oil filters, 50 universal joints and 10 brake kits. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately SLL 300,000. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Sullay plans to construct a house on his land from the proceeds of the business. By adding to his present capital, he will be able to maximize profits and send his first child to a nursery school in this coming academic year.

She is married to a contractor, and has 3 children, ages 14, 11 and 3 years all going to school. \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Mabinty established her textiles and rubber slippers business. She began her business after she left school when she got in an accident. She did not have anyone to help her further her education. She decided to join her aunt in business. It is the only thing she can earn money for and it is one thing she knows best. Working 7 days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about 1,049,000 SLL every month from this business. She is only assisted by a family member. Her suppliers are located in Conakry and Freetown. She usually travels to Conakry twice a month and to Freetown whenever she has shortages in stock.\r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of 5,000,000 SLL. Mabinty has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan, and now requires a new loan in order to purchase 1 bale of English Wax Cotton @ 5,000,000 SLL. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately 263,000 SLL. The loans will help her greatly if she is given the chance to access them.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Mabinty plans to open a larger outlet with different types of textiles and footwear. It is good because it will help her make a positive turn in her business. She is very excited with her business. She wants to educate her children to a higher standard. Mabinty's major challenges are the rainy season and inflation in foreign currency, but she goes for quality products with prices that can be afforded by her customers. Mabinty uses part of her profit to add onto her operating capital and the rest she sets aside for any domestic problems. She is hardworking and honest. She thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":926458,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to purchase 1 bale of English Wax Cotton @ 5,000,000 SLL","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2011-11-24T17:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mabinty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4980000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":498000},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":498000},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":498000},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":498000},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":498000},{"due_date":"2012-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":498000},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":498000},{"due_date":"2012-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":498000},{"due_date":"2012-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":498000},{"due_date":"2012-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":498000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":120.48,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:29:16Z","rounded_local_amount":500000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250721826},{"amount":120.48,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:40:15Z","rounded_local_amount":500000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257124734},{"amount":120.48,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":500000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505640},{"amount":120.48,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":500000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974746},{"amount":120.48,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":500000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815314},{"amount":120.48,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:05:25Z","rounded_local_amount":500000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444371},{"amount":120.48,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:01:57Z","rounded_local_amount":500000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537103},{"amount":144.58,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:17Z","rounded_local_amount":600000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294284594},{"amount":48.19,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:14:23Z","rounded_local_amount":200000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301338186},{"amount":163.87,"local_amount":680000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:35Z","rounded_local_amount":680000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308354597}],"funded_date":"2011-11-28T00:51:14Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sheilah Asher","image":274296}},{"id":365725,"name":"Poy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Poy is 29 years old, married, and has three children.

She lacks funds to expand her poultry farming, and is seeking a loan of 30,000 KES (Kenyan shillings) to buy poultry. \n\nAccessing funds is very challenging for a woman, but through institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva, Susan feels relieved knowing that she will be able to buy more poultry and achieve her dream. Through the loan, she will sell eggs and poultry products to her neighbors and to the local market and this will translate to increased profits and an improved income level. \n\nBeing a visionary woman, she intends to accumulate more profit and expand her poultry market to other markets, increasing her income and allowing her to improve her living conditions. The extra income she will get will be used in fully repaying the loan, permanently changing her living conditions, and securing the future of her school-going children.\n\nThis loan will help Susan in her poultry business and in her personal life.

She is married and has a child. Since she was a young girl, Sabohatkhon used to help her mother with her clothing sales business. Four years ago, Sabohatkhon began selling towels and blankets, since her husband\u2019s income as a taxi driver was not enough to cover their family expenses. That was how she got a taste of the business and was convinced that it left her sufficient revenue. <P>\r\n\r\nCurrently, she works in this business full-time, and thanks to her enthusiasm, she has made a name for herself in the market. However, her clients request more and more things each day, which is why Sabohatkhon is requesting a loan of 2500 Somoni, which she is willing to repay in a 10-month term. With this money, Sabohatkhon will be able to purchase more towels and blankets and thereby give her business a boost.<P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She lives in her own home with her three children, who she educates with love and dedication.  Her carpentry shop, located a few blocks from her home, is the place where her customers have become accustomed to visit and solicit her services.  Her then boyfriend, who began developing experience in woodworking as a child, introduced her to carpentry.  They later married and she developed his passion for furniture making.  Nilda began helping him run the shop and sharing the more difficult jobs.  What she likes most about her work is that she is able to share the activities with her entire family, each member contributing \"grain of sand\" to the shop.  Never-the-less, she must still dedicate some time to her young children in order to prevent accidents in the shop.  In the future she hopes to acquire some machinery in order to speed up her furniture making, allowing her to accept orders from new customers.  This will be her first loan through \" Microfinanzas PRISMA\" and she is determined to meet her repayment obligations, in order to be able to receive another loan in the future.

Maria has a business making chemical products, principally air fresheners, shampoos, bleach, etc.  She began this business 10 years ago, after she noticed that all of the household products that are bought in Nicaragua are imported.  On this basis she decided to combine chemicals to make air fresheners.  Recently, she has had some small problems with the supply, that is to say that there are more products on the market than the people demand, but with good marketing techniques she has managed to stay in the market.

She is 63 years old. Preciosa is widowed and has 4 adult children. To make a living, Preciosa operates a family member's business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Preciosa has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Preciosa joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Preciosa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase piglets, livestock feed and other supplies. Preciosa is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. This will be the 6th loan taken out by Preciosa from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She lives in her own house with her spouse, V\u00edctor, 44, and their three beloved children that she wants to provide more comfort for.\r\n\r\nNancy is a very hard working woman who strives daily to do the best for her family.  She works in agriculture cultivating cocoa beans, coffee and achiote.  She\u2019s been doing this work for 18 years with much dedication and diligence because thanks to the fruits her plants provide she was able to acquire more land to farm and also bought her own vehicle to transport her crops to the gathering centers in the city of San Francisco where she gets the best prices for her grains.\r\n\r\nDuring harvesting and weed clearing she necessarily must hire day laborers in order to streamline the programmed tasks.\r\n\r\nNancy has two fallow hectares that she needs financial help in order to carry out the programmed tasks in.  For now, she plans to plant more cocoa beans and coffee so she is asking MFP for the loans that they give to people of low resources who want to progress.\r\n\r\nFor the good of her work she hopes to have the same strength and drive that characterizes her to successfully grow her crops.  This will be loan #2 with MFP and hopes to have your collaboration in order to reach her goals and she commits to make her payments according to the payment schedule because she wants to access future loans.  She will use the 3000 new sol loans to buy cocoa bean and coffee seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":794149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cocoa bean and coffee seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-22T01:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":202.92},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":216.9},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":218.11},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":226},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":236.72},{"due_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":242.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":253.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":260.7},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":268.78},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":282.97},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":290.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":300.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.4},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.53},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.98},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.86},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":86.8},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.01},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.95},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":98.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.76},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.37},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.18,"local_amount":210.48,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":212.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550480},{"amount":79.82,"local_amount":217.68,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":220.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719161},{"amount":82.51,"local_amount":225.04,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":227.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350625},{"amount":86.32,"local_amount":235.43,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:00Z","rounded_local_amount":238.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851050},{"amount":82.7,"local_amount":225.54,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:39Z","rounded_local_amount":228.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666217},{"amount":90.2,"local_amount":246,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:37Z","rounded_local_amount":248.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621357},{"amount":92.64,"local_amount":252.66,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:47Z","rounded_local_amount":255.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835441},{"amount":95.99,"local_amount":261.8,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":264.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245257},{"amount":98.98,"local_amount":269.94,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":273.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385369},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":284.09,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:36Z","rounded_local_amount":287.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098489},{"amount":209.49,"local_amount":571.34,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:08Z","rounded_local_amount":577.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712660}],"funded_date":"2011-06-22T16:08:47Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":312436,"name":"Elvira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvira is 53 years old and married with three children.\r\n\r\nElvira works hard to provide for her family.
