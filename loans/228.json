He says that his major challenge is financial constraints and the fact that there are too many other people in the area doing the same kind of business as his and so customers are spoilt for choice. However, he works very hard to keep his business doing well. He is using his loan of Kes 50,000 to buy broilers (chickens) to supply to nearby restaurants to expand his business while taking care of his customers' demands.

He is married to Jenny, age 28, and they live in their own house with their two dear children to whom they want to offer a better future.  Marcial works at tilling the soil.  He grows cacao, coffee, and citrus fruits on the 3 hectares of land that he owns.  When he was a young child, his parents taught him to farm, and at the age of 20 he purchased his own land.  Ever since then he has worked his own land.\r\n<p>\r\nAt harvest time or when clearing his land Marcial needs help.  That\u2019s why he contracts with day laborers in order to carry out these activities quickly.  He feels very committed to his work because, thanks to his daily effort, he enjoys seeing very productive crops which generate respectable earnings.  He tells us that during the winter there was a lot of rain which hurt his crops.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP.   He is obligated to make his payments on time, and he is determined to do so.  He is thankful to the institution for giving him so much support.  With the loan applied for he will buy sacks of fertilizer and cacao seed so that he can plant it and have a bigger harvest in a short time.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":772762,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

This single mother of 2 children has owned a small grocery store or \u201ctienda D. abarrotes\u201d for the past ten years. Modesta began working as a \u201cferiante,\u201d which means that she would travel from the city of Ayacucho, Per\u00fa several hours to the rural countrysiD. to buy large supplies of cereals and other products to bring home and sell in the smaller city markets. It was an extremely difficult way of life, and one which did not allow the generation of much profit. It had always been a dream of Modesta\u2019s to open a grocery store, and so one day she decided to change gears completely and accomplish her lifelong goal. \r\n<p>\r\nToday, 10 years later, Modesta is the proud owner of a beautiful grocery store in a neighborhood just outsiD. the city center of Ayacucho. As the keen businesswoman Modesta has grown to be, she is always looking for ways to increase the amount of business that passes through her doors. She began with a simple supply of \u201cabarrotes,\u201d or staple food items sold in bulk such as rice, flour and cooking oil. This grew to the supply of more specialized food items, candies, and sodas. Just recently, she has begun selling a wiD. selection of fresh vegetables and homemaD. condiments. Daily she prepares a variety of traditional Peruvian condiments such as chili and garlic sauces that greatly help her busy customers in the preparation of their daily meals. Modesta decided to add these new products to her grocery store because she says the only way to attract more customers is through offering new and different products. She happily reports that the vegetables and condiments have been a great success and she is serving even more customers than ever. \r\n<p>\r\nModesta is currently working towards her goal of renovating her home and grocery store. It is the next step, she says, in the continual improvement of her business. It is very necessary that she turns over the greatest profit possible as she not only supports her two children, but also the three surviving grandchildren of her son who just recently passed away. For this reason, she is very happy to be a part of her village bank. There, she has learned how to save her money in the bank where it accumulates interest. It is also a place where she is able to socialize with friends and be distracted from the difficulties of life. Modesta is currently requesting a loan of $300, with which she will buy larger quantities of products to stock in her grocery store."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":84987,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy larger quantities of goods to sell in her grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-11-19T01:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Modesta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-03T05:10:57Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":898,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":224.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":224.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":224.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":224.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":224.5,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T10:22:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:28Z","rounded_local_amount":224.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107582},{"amount":75,"local_amount":224.5,"processed_date":"2008-02-03T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:28Z","rounded_local_amount":224.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":127471},{"amount":75,"local_amount":224.5,"processed_date":"2008-03-03T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:28Z","rounded_local_amount":224.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":148194},{"amount":75,"local_amount":224.5,"processed_date":"2008-04-03T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-03T10:27:28Z","rounded_local_amount":224.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172617}],"funded_date":"2007-11-19T05:10:57Z","paid_date":"2008-04-03T10:10:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":28509,"name":"Fidayaddin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fidayaddin is an Internally Displaced Person from the Fizuli region located in the south-east part of Azerbaijan.

They have one daughter, Joselin. They live together in their own home in the city of Tarma.  Arturo tells us that he will be married in 2 weeks.  Twenty-eight years ago, he began working in a public transportation company as a driver.  He would bring the residents of the area to different cities.  During this time, he was in an accident that left him disabled.  He is now arranging his pension for the time that he worked.  He tells us that during this time of crisis, the person who helped with the household expenses was his wife.  She makes her living selling guinea pigs and pigs.  First she feeds them, and when they reach a specific weight, they are sold in the wholesale market in the city.  She earns 400 PEN per sale.  Arturo's main problem is the monthly expense of the school his daugther attends.  Because of that expense and because he is not currently working, he is planning to get into the business of making health food with the mill that he has.  He wants to make quinoa, maca (a radish-like root), soy and other flours.  Arturo belongs to the communal bank \u201cSe\u00f1or de Muruhuay\u201d, and this is his third loan with MFP, with which he hopes to make his plans into reality.  Arturo will take the first step for his business by investing the loan in the purchase of corn by the kilo to start working and processing it on his mill."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":734405,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase corn by the kilo to process and make into corn flour.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-21T23:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Arturo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1038,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350233}],"funded_date":"2011-03-22T18:08:28Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":287493,"name":"Angelina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\n\n\nEn la Cuenca del Papaluapan existe una comunidad llamada Paso Rincon la cual se caracteriza por ser productora de limon, en este lugar existe la contumbre de que toda la familia trabaja en la cosecha desde los hijos hasta los padres y abuelos.\n\nEn esta comunidad vive una se\u00f1ora llamada Angelina P.

Their eagerness to learn is an inspiration for him to keep producing rice crops twice a year. Armel has been very patient in managing his farming business and, for the past 10 years, he has cultivated a one-hectare rice field.

This specific type of grocery store is known as a \u201ctienda de abarrotes,\u201d which is the name given to the sale of bulk food products such as rice, flour and cooking oil. However, upon entering her small \u201ctienda,\u201d it is obvious that Victoria puts a great deal of effort into the provision of a wide variety of products. She has a vegetable stand complete with several different types of potatoes as well as a small butchering corner where she can provide fresh cuts of meat to her customers. One can also find every type of snack food and candy on the fully stocked shelves lining the walls. \r\n<p>\r\nBefore she opened her grocery store, Victoria was selling food products from a small stand in one of the many markets in Ayacucho. However, when she became pregnant with her first of two children, she decided to change professions to one which allowed her more free time to be with her children. For this reason, she opened her store from the front of her home. Additionally, Victoria\u2019s husband owns a restaurant nearby, which she supplies with all of her food products. \r\n<p>\r\nAs far as goals are concerned, Victoria has many. She says she is always looking for ways to grow her business and attract more customers as well as save diligently. Currently, she is saving capital to one day build a second story onto her home. For the past 3 years, Victoria has been a part of her village bank, and it is because of this that she has been able to grow even more rapidly and save her capital in the bank where it is accumulating interest. She is very happy within her bank, she says, because it has taught her how to be more responsible and she also enjoys the many friendships she has made there. Victoria is requesting a loan of $1000. With this money, she says she will buy a little more of everything to stock in her grocery store, thus attracting more customers and earning a greater profit."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":85009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase the amount and variety of goods sold in her grocery store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-11-19T02:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victoria Ursula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-04T07:25:21Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2997,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":749.25},{"due_date":"2008-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":749.25},{"due_date":"2008-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":749.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":749.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":749.25,"processed_date":"2008-01-04T10:19:26Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:28:06Z","rounded_local_amount":749.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":108265},{"amount":250,"local_amount":749.25,"processed_date":"2008-02-04T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:28:06Z","rounded_local_amount":749.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128258},{"amount":250,"local_amount":749.25,"processed_date":"2008-03-04T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:28:06Z","rounded_local_amount":749.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":149306},{"amount":250,"local_amount":749.25,"processed_date":"2008-04-04T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-04T10:28:06Z","rounded_local_amount":749.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":173650}],"funded_date":"2007-11-20T07:25:21Z","paid_date":"2008-04-04T10:12:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":28525,"name":"Ikram","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ikram has run his farming business for 10 years.

The eldest two children attend school. The family lives in the village of Sitio Napulo, Brgy. Cerantes, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. As a mother, Arlene is always looking ahead and thinking about her children's future. She makes plans for when they grow up; she wants to send them to school and get a college degree, and later have a stable job, have their own family, and be free from poverty. But then she sometimes questions how her dreams can be fulfilled because her husband's income is too small and not sufficient even to cover their household expenses. \r\n<p>\r\nWith these aspirations in mind, Arlene began to help her husband by selling seaweed in the local market and other neighboring places. The little she earned helped defray the household expenses and support her children's school-related needs. She then decided to expand her business to earn more, and so asked around about where and how she could access additional capital to do this. It was at this time that she learned about NWTF-Project Dungganon and how it could help her financial needs. In 1996, Arlene became a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon, and she used her first loan cycle to increase the volume of her seaweed business. She diligently paid her weekly installments and maintained her good credit record so that she could take advantage of a larger loan in the next cycle. By so doing she increased her income. She then had enough capital to start another business, a general store in her neighborhood. The store now earns 3,000 PHP a month to supplement the family income.\r\n<p>\r\nArlene is a shrewd businesswoman and plans her cash flow well. In her previously cycle, she borrowed 17,000 PHP, which she used to invest in her business. She was able to fully pay it on time and without any delays. This time around, for her ninth cycle loan, she is borrowing only 6,000 PHP. This is because she anticipates that demand for her products will drop because people in her neighborhood will have less disposable income as it is off-season for the biggest employers in the area \u2013 the sugar mill and sugar plantations. She intends to add the loan to her revolving working capital in her general store.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF<\/b><br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

Her main goal is to prosper with her business, increase her sales, and through this to receive more recognition in the community. Also, she wants to help her sister continue studying.

She earns her living by operating oyster culture and fish vending businesses. Her husband Jesus E., who is 50 years old, works as a businessman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 4 children who are 14 to 28 years old. \r\n\r\nCirila joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 5 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cirila has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 6th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 13000, which she intends to add to her capital to purchase a fishing boat and to fund her oyster culture activities so that she can continue to save up for future, for family and business. \r\n\r\nThe accompanying picture shows Cirila on the beach pointing to her oyster culture site. Cirila E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is married to a farmer and has three children, the oldest of whom is 8 years old. Her kids are in school and daycare while she is at work. Following the recommendations of her sister five years ago, Nazira invested a start-up capital of 20,000 soms in retailing consumer goods in a market in the small town of Kerben.\r\n\r\nShe is happy with how she is running the business despite the challenges she faces with transportation of wholesale goods. Nazira\u2019s home town of Kerben is several hours away from the capital Bishkek, where she gets the wholesale products. This long distance affects the quality of goods and her ability to cover costs. In order to attract more customers she applied for a loan from Kiva that would help her to broaden the assortment of her products. She plans to spend the anticipated proceeds on purchasing an automobile so that she can transport the goods herself.\r\n\r\n      --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

He works to help his children.  He is a potter.  He learned this occupation while still a little boy; his father taught him.  Today, he sells to and buys from small producers.  He bakes the items and then sells them in the market.  His difficulty is winter which is when production drops off.\r\n\r\nHe is asking for a loan to buy merchandise needed for his production: firewood, nacazcol seeds (source of black ink), and unbaked pots and to pay for transportation.

This fact made her decide a year ago to set up on the side of their home a little candy shop and juice shop, with the intention of providing economically for her six year-old daughter. Previosuly, Rosario was just dedicated to studying. When she married her partner and gave birth to her little daughter, the responsibilities became a lot greater and she saw the obligation to postpone her managerial studies for a period, with the hope of beginning them again in the future. Today she has been able to meet both her goals by satisfactorily finishing her studies without neglecting her role as a mother, so she may now look to the future with optimism. For this reason she will continue working and managing her own business with the longing to make it grow and create her own enterprise that will generate resources for her family and a group of families in her neighborhood. Rosario wants to open a store where she sells medical materials and instruments commercially because her house is located close to a hospital, but meanwhile she will continue working in her convenient store and extending the same quality of service as always. For this purpose she needs to invest a small amount of money in her present business to cover the expenses of her young daughter's education.

She has 4 children, 2 of whom are working and the other 2 are still going to school. To be able to fulfil her children\u2019 needs for school supplies, she and her husband have to cut down on their living costs. In 1999, she talked to her husband and decided to join the TYM Fund and borrow money. At first, she used the borrowed money to breed animals. However, breeding animals did not bring her much profit while she had to spend money to buy food for them. After researching about the local\u2019s need, she decided to borrow money to invest in making tofu. This activity brought her profit. They could also feed the pigs from the remaining tofu. Their family economy becomes stable through time. Currently, her husband and children are responsible for making the tofu at home and she does the selling process.

Because they did not have enough capital to invest in the pig business, it did not yield enough income for her family. In 2005, she joined TYM to get a loan and she invested all in her pig business. She built new pig pen and expanded the operation. This has been a success. Things have changed for the better. Her family financial situation has improved a lot. She has been able to buy all the necesary goods for her household. She and her husband work hard, when they have free time they go to work for other farmers.

agricultural products in the markets of the closest towns or to traders from the same area. Her responsibilities as a mother have encouraged her to pursue farming activities to continue growing the best vegetables in the area. However, she wants to increase her investment in agriculture and expand her farmland to improve the living standards of her beloved family. Let\u2019s help this mother to keep working for the well-being of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He now lives with one of them.  Since his childhood he has worked in agriculture.  Through this work, he was able to educate all of his children and offer well-being to his family.  But what he never could control were the occasional plagues caused by a lot of rain.  As a consequence, he told us he is sad because his potato crop has been affected.  Now his production won't be as good as he thought, so his sadness has made his normally bright eyes cloudy.  Hermenegildo will cut the leaves of his potatoes with the help of his wife to avoid losing his entire crop.  Once he harvests them, he will sell them as seeds.  He hopes to be quoted a good price so he can cover the educational expenses of his youngest son, who helps him with his agricultural work.  Hermenegildo is very responsible, not only with his payments to Microfinanzas Prisma, but also with each one of his agreements with his communal bank.  This is his seventh loan.  The money that he is requesting will go towards chemical fertilizers for his next planting of potatoes and peas.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":304958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-18T23:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hermenegildo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":975,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3027.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123953}],"funded_date":"2009-04-19T04:05:11Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":106388,"name":"Jesus Demarche Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The \u201cJesus Demarche\u201d or \u201cJesus is working\u201d Group is made up of fifteen male and female entrepreneurs.

She is 45 years old and lives with her husband and 3 children in their own home.  For 20 years, she has engaged in arduous farm labor along with her family.  They primarily grow potatoes, but also raise sheep and other small animals such as guinea pigs.  Every morning they allow their animals to graze during their long walks that can last for hours because of the expanse of their pastures.  Once six months have passed after the planting of their potato crops, the activities involved with the harvest begin to intensify because a lot more physical work is required.  In the meantime, Julia sells guinea pigs in response to urgent needs that arise at home.\r\n<p>\r\nIn previous years, their crops have provided variable gains.  Despite these difficulties, Julia has been able to support her family and continues to fight so that she can have better harvests.  \r\n<p>\r\nJulia is requesting her fourth loan from MFP.  Her perseverance and participation in her Communal Bank have enabled her to become recognized as one of the most supportive members of her group.  She pledges to continue with a good attitude.  The money she is requesting will be used to purchase heads of sheep and fertilizer for the next planting season.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":374026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizer & heads of sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-22T05:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3552,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124012}],"funded_date":"2009-08-22T15:52:23Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":135099,"name":"Borann","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Borann P., 48, is widow, lives in a small village a long National Road Number five about twenty kilometers from Phnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products such as sweet candies, biscuits, and mango, in the local community. Adulfa has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 2,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Adulfa joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Adulfa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Adulfa is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Adulfa from GDMPC.

Due to all of these challenges, she made up her mind to become a GHAPE member in 2008. In this same year, she received her pioneer loan of 40,000FRS and the repayment was done promptly. With a loan of 150,0000FRS, she plans to buy palm oil, water fufu and eru (a popular Cameroonian dish) and cultivate a small yam farm. The loan repayment will start from the day the loan is disbursed. She is sure the business will succeed because she has been doing this business for a long period of time. She has a good location for that particular business. And she has a lot of customers.\r\nHer neighbors are happy her business is right beside them, because they don't have to go to the market and they can buy from her late at night. She plans to use the profit to plough back into the business, cater for her son, and give good medical attention to herself and her son.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

She lives in the community of San Antonio, a community that is part of the Cumbe region. This region is well known for its exuberant vegetation. The climate is relatively cold and the population is mostly made up of cattle farmers and agriculturists. Many of the young members of the population have emigrated in search of better work opportunities.\r\n\r\nLaura Azucena is 33 years old, she is married and she has 5 children, aged 17, 15, 14, 11 and 9. The four eldest children are in school and her youngest daughter goes to primary school in the community. Her husband is a construction worker. They have their own home because it was inherited from her parents. But her brother mortgaged the house to move to the United States. Unfortunately he never paid back the loan so their house is currently in foreclosure. \r\n\r\nLaura Azucena's occupation is raising pigs and guinea pigs. She sells them in the community and whenever she has a special requirement she washes clothes and cleans houses, but this is not a regular job. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of the community bank for the past 6 years and she has received a great deal of support in the development of her business, and in turn she has been able to send her kids to school. This loan will be invested in the purchase of pigs. Her goal is to give her kids a better education so that they may succeed in life. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":582604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-08-13T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laura Azucena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:13Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166847073},{"amount":155,"local_amount":154,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113529},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407218},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:39Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407219},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:53Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388307},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388308},{"amount":232.5,"local_amount":231,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":232.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682806}],"funded_date":"2010-08-14T16:48:28Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":226053,"name":"Bunthea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Bunthea M.

Eduard receives a lot of orders, but he often has to turn down potential customers because he cannot make high-quality videos with the equipment he owns at the moment.

All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n\r\n<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\n\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":25858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Invest in products for his store and physical improvements to the shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-14T01:50:53Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-30T00:24:08Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":825,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":138,"local_amount":138,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:41Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":138,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21425},{"amount":137,"local_amount":137,"processed_date":"2007-07-13T22:35:54Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":137,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31809},{"amount":120,"local_amount":120,"processed_date":"2007-09-07T19:14:21Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":120,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51884},{"amount":430,"local_amount":430,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T22:18:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":430,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107781}],"funded_date":"2007-04-16T00:24:08Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T22:18:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12172,"name":"Semendar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

S. is 39 years old, married and has three children, all of whom are in school. Gulnora makes a living selling children's clothing in the local market. She started her business eight years ago, with some help from her husband, who provided start-up funds. Gradually, Gulnora's business has expanded. Because she is hard-working and polite by nature, she has managed to obtain a devoted clientel that is happy with the goods and services she provides, and her business generates a stable income for the family. Gulnora loves her children very much and wants all of them to be well-educated. This year her daughter finished secondary school, and Gulnora wants her to enter university. To be able to do that, Gulnora has applied for a loan of $600, which she will pay back in 12 months. She will use the loan to buy additional clothing and increase the range of items she has for sale.

With this loan of 500 soles, to be repaid in 4 payments, she will invest in her current business and buy chicken, mayonnaise, and other items. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a small market, not a portable cart. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Brittany Thatcher, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":223359,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase condiments for sandwiches","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Victor Larco, Trujillo - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-11-19T05:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaqueline Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T07:58:23Z","rounded_local_amount":135.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5331111},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":135.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951736},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":135.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224783},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":135.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417505}],"funded_date":"2008-11-19T09:27:33Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T19:50:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brittany Thatcher","image":null}},{"id":77732,"name":"Khiev","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Khiev N., 30, is a rice farmer who lives in the Batchenhchean commune in Pursat Province.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Elsa L..\r\n\r\nElsa is single. To make a living, Elsa owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale. Elsa has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Elsa joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

His wife generally works with in team with him, but for the harvest season he contracts laborers, in order to more easily crop his final products, that are to be sold to the local collection centers.

The family own a small rabbit farm where they raise rabbits for sale. Muna came to FATEN and asked for a loan in order to purchase more rabbits and feed to answer the increased demand, as Al Adha feast is coming soon.\n\nMuna, her husband and one of her sons work on the farm, while the rest are school students. Muna and her husband aim to increase returns and enlarge the farm, especially because they are a big family and Gaza has a lot of farms, which increases competition.\n\nMuna's husband appears on the farm in the picture here since the conservative background Muna comes from prevents her from having her picture online.\n\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\n \nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee.

With the money that she is requesting, she will stock her beauty salon with many instruments and indispensible products to continue working. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":248597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To stock her beauty salon with necessary products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-30T04:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:55Z","rounded_local_amount":768.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640359}],"funded_date":"2008-12-30T05:27:06Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":85940,"name":"Carolina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carolina es madre soltera, vive con sus dos hijos peque\u00f1os en la casa de sus abuelos.

She dedicates herself to selling snacks from a small kiosk she had built very close to a school.  She has been carrying out this activity for two years and what she enjoys is that she sells on a daily basis.  Her primary customers are the children who attend the school and pass near her location.  The business is very profitable because, even during the vacation season, the road where she is located is well-traveled.

She has a son who depends on her financial support.  Juana has a small shop where she sells books and groceries.  She started her business selling school supplies.  Two years ago she began selling wine but gave it up because it was not very profitable.  With her earnings she expanded her business to include selling groceries and was able to buy a display case and shelving for her merchandise.  She is developing her business in her home.  The first loan of 300 Sols which she received from her communal bank (Jerid Camino al \u00c9xito II Communal Bank) was used to buy groceries.  With this loan of 900 Sols, which will be repaid in six months, she intends to buy ingredients for preparing meals, school supplies and uniforms.

At the age of thirty-six, she is divorced and raises two daughters on her own. To earn her small family\u2019s living she works in a nursing home as a matron. Both of her daughters go to school, and as they grow, Jyldyz\u2019s monthly salary of $50 has begun to be insufficient to provide everything for her daughters. So Jyldyz has found herself an extra occupation, selling fruits. Her sister has been selling fruits for many years and once advised her to start doing the same. She helped Jyldyz with the first purchase and now this new activity allows Jyldyz to cover her family\u2019s living expenses. Jyldyz has decided to obtain a loan and purchase fruits in a neighboring region in larger quantities and bring them to her town to sell. This way she would be able to earn more money and make a needed repair at her house. Jyldyz is ready to do everything within her capability to provide her daughters with a good college education. In the near future she is going to open a small shop. \r\n\r\nJyldyz\u2019s partners are: Zamira, Erkingul and Taasil. Zamira, age 43, has raised four children. She is engaged in cattle breeding and her husband is an excavator operator. Her 19-year-old daughter helps Zamira keep house. Zamira needs a loan to purchase fodder and hay for the cattle.\r\n\r\nErkingul, age 26, has two children. Her husband sells flour. Before, he used to receive flour instead of a salary, which he would exchange for cattle. He would then feed and resell them. Now Erkingul is engaged in raising the cattle. Erkingul needs a loan to purchase calves and fodder for them.\r\n\r\nTaasil, age 47, has mothered six children. Most of them have left for Russia to work. Her husband works at a construction site and she bakes bread and manufactures traditional articles. Taasil needs a loan to purchase coal, as winter is approaching. \r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Now, people in Kirgizstan are in an avid search for a haven, where they could lead a quality life while working their dream job. \r\n\r\nAilarhon B. is the leader of this group. She\u2019s forty-five years old and she begins her day at sunrise milking the cows. It is worthy to note, that her day job is teaching English at a local school. But fifteen years ago, together with her husband, she bought some livestock and began to breed cattle -- raising and milking it. Today her flock includes three heifers and three milking cows. This business brings in about five thousand soms a month, which is a very decent income in the countryside. \r\nAilarahon has four children. Her oldest daughter is studying at a university, her middle one just got married, and her youngest daughter helps her mother around the house and with the business. Her youngest child \u2013 her son \u2013 works construction. \r\nAilrahon is asking for a loan, because she plans to expand her business and buy another cow. In the near future she needs enough resources to fix up her house, buy new furniture and marry off her daughters. She understands that this will involve dedication and constant work. \r\n\r\nShe has three partners in the group:\r\n\r\nGairatbek P. is thirty-five years old, and the last ten of them he has fattened and sold livestock. He buys a bull, fattens it for about three months, and then resells it at the livestock market. He has three growing children, and so he needs to increase his income if he wants to meet the growing needs of his family. With the loan, he would buy a heifer to raise more cattle. \r\n\r\nTillyahan S. is forty-three years old and a mother of three children. Her main objective in life is to raise her children and help them get a good start in life. She\u2019s retired right now and raises livestock and corn for a living.
