She works each and every day to get ahead in her business since, for her, it is very gratifying to live in a county as beautiful as San Vicente.  However, she knows everything isn\u2019t fantasy and that it\u2019s a scientific fact that she has to work hard to help her children get ahead. They are young, and still need the strength and support of their parents.  She sells shoes and her husband sells pans and knives in other areas of the country.  Carmen buys shoes for the business and sells them on credit.  Somehow, this way of working generates income.  She travels door to door to visit customers, and charges on a weekly basis.  Her shoes start at $10; she has been working only a few months.\r\n\r\nCarmen has been married for 5 years and, given how young her children still are, it has often been difficult to carry out her work.  However, her mother has been a great help by caring for the kids while she works.  They live with her in-laws, and she hopes to have her own house one day.  She hopes to use part of the loan to buy merchandise, and share the other part with her husband.  She buys different styles of shoes, which her sister helps her choose from the merchandise available.  \r\n\r\nCarmen buys three-dozen pairs of shoes each month, which the distributor delivers directly to her home.  She places her order based on customer demand, selling her shoes each morning and charging customers on Sundays.  She has not had any problems with customers, as they all are punctual with their payments.  Once she collects the funds, she places another order.  Falling in love is what led Carmen to relocate until she got engaged.    \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":533384,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase shoes for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-05-05T11:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen Anabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:58Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709105},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:03Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892403},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:21Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632765},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:19Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846799}],"funded_date":"2010-05-05T13:41:34Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":201894,"name":"Gary Alejandro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El joven Gary Alejandro R.

She started her own private business in 2005 by selling a variety of fruits. In 2009, she began to operate a clothing trading business and has since built a stable operation.

Miriam tells us that she has always enjoyed working and that, when they got married, she and her husband decided to open a business so that they could earn a little extra money and offer their family a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nMiriam tells us that, as her husband knows how to make bread, they opened a bakery.

This way they can save money on shipping costs as well as the P. item cost.  Those who don\u2019t weave or sell products have businesses buying and selling corn and beans, two staple foods of the region.  They travel to Santiago D.

For twenty years, she has worked in the business of selling handicrafts as souvenirs and typical clothing from the area for tourists.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes,  is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and to a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Arhangai province, one of Mongolia's central provinces. His children's ages range from 19 to 26. Oyunchimeg is a very entrepreneurial woman. Since 1992, she has been involved in many types of small business. Her first business was importing cheap clothes from Ereen, China, a border town from where many cheap Chinese products are imported. Since 2004, she has been selling cut wood to local carpenters. Within five years, she expanded the business, with her business capital increasing from 1,000,000 MNT to 3,400,000 MNT. \r\n<p>\r\nNow Oyunchimeg would like to open a small internet cafe to offer internet services and computer games to local people. She sees a great market opportunity as many local young people are really getting into internet surfing and computer games. She is committed to making the internet cafe a success as her private businesses are the sole source of family income. All of her children are top students at their respective high schools, and Oyunchimeg wants to make sure that they all continue their studies at the universities of their choice and pursue their dreams. She says that she works very hard to make all this come true. \r\n<p>\r\nOyunchimeg is requesting a loan to purchase computers and internet access for her new internet

She is 31 years old, divorced, and lives happily with her two daughters \u2013 Francesca (age 14) and Yurubi (age 4).\r\n<p> \r\nEvery day Carmen wakes up early to care for her two young daughters, who provide her with a reason for living and are the objects of her adoration.  Afterwards, she must quickly prepare meals for her patrons who purchase the rich and diverse dishes she offers on a daily basis.  She fulfills any request without objection, because her customers also ask her to deliver meals to neighbors, acquaintances, or friends.  Her dishes are in high demand.  Carmen\u2019s ability to create a new dish every day was something she learned from her mother.  Even though she keeps her recipes a secret, she manages to satisfy her customers by providing flavorful dishes and selling them at a low price.\r\n<p>\r\nSince she offers a different dish every day of the week, her business has grown rapidly and continues to generate good earnings.  Her daughters help out in their spare time, but Carmen prefers that they focus on their studies so that they can pursue a profession, an opportunity that she did not have.  Her ex-husband provides financial support in raising her daughters.  Carmen hopes to manage her own restaurant in the future.\r\n<p>\r\nEven though she is taking her ninth loan with MFP, Carmen once again promises to be punctual and make her payments on time.  She hopes to continue growing and succeeding.  She is happy to be working with her Communal Bank because the other women in her group are fighters just like her.  With the money she is requesting, she will buy merchandise to restock her pantry so that she can continue preparing meals to sell.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":414948,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase ingredients for preparing meals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-28T18:10:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":83.5,"local_amount":238.58,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:33Z","rounded_local_amount":238.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843108},{"amount":170.06,"local_amount":485.89,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:32Z","rounded_local_amount":486.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734686},{"amount":6.77,"local_amount":19.34,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":19.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124075},{"amount":96.86,"local_amount":276.75,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:20Z","rounded_local_amount":277.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959757},{"amount":167.81,"local_amount":479.44,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:41Z","rounded_local_amount":479.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717393}],"funded_date":"2009-10-28T19:37:13Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":152025,"name":"On's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is a small loan request for two borrowers.

Later, after she finishes her activities in the home, she has to work for the Municipality of Urcos in the public cleaning department where she cleans streets, plazas and parks in the city of Urcos.  She tells us that she has a small handicraft workshop where her daughter Rosmery works.  She has had this business for some years now, and it has gone very well, thanks to all of the effort she puts into her work.  She is a hardworking and enterprising mother who needs a loan to buy more material such as wool, fabrics, thread and leather to make more crafts.

She owns a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Orepa has 6 years of experience in this business.  Orepa needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 355 tala or US $148 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Orepa joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Orepa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Orepa V. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

daughter.  Djumabay was born in 1969 into a simple farmer's family.  His father had a small farm, and since childhood, Djumabay helped his father with caring for the livestock and dreamed of having his own farm in the future.  In 1988, after finishing school, Djumabay went to serve in the army.  Upon his return to his native village in 1990, he studied to become a driver of agricultural machinery and was hired at the local collective farm as a tractor\/combine driver.  After some time, Djumabay got married and, using his salary, gradually purchased young livestock and grew clover and cereals; thus, expanding his farm.  His daughter was born in 2002, and Djumabay was able to buy his own house for his family in 2003.  Currently, thanks to Djumabay's persistence, his farm contains 3 dairy cows and 22 heads of sheep.  In order to further develop his business, Djumabay requested a loan in the sum of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" for the purchase of bulls for fattening up.  In the future, Djumabay plans to increase livestock headcount and dreams of buying an off-road vehicle.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":909297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Chaldovar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-04T20:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Djumabay","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2012-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":880},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":660},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":660}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":880,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":40075.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283072157},{"amount":660,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:13:07Z","rounded_local_amount":30056.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308095354},{"amount":660,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T10:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":30056.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355754526}],"funded_date":"2011-12-19T18:12:46Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T10:19:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":357661,"name":"Luz Katherine","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Luz es una cliente nueva en la instituci\u00f3n vino por referencias de un familiar que tuvo un cr\u00e9dito en la instituci\u00f3n ya cancelado se dedica a la venta de comida en una pensi\u00f3n por un mercado el cr\u00e9dito esta destinado a la compra de sillas, mesas, vajillas un televisor de 21 pulgadas un aparato de radio y algunos utensilios para mejorar la calidad en el servicio y ampliar su negocio.

People like to eat them fresh and make fresh juices which is very healthy. She sells her crops in the central bazaar and her monthly income is 300 Azerbaijani manats (AZN). Raising crops takes a lot of strength and means working in the open air, which is very hard for women. Guldasta is a very strong woman and has the potential to work even harder to produce more crops.\r\n\r\nGuldasta needs additional capital to invest in seeds and fertilizers. This will allow her to improve the quality of the products she grows and increase monthly turnover. For this purpose, she applied for a 1000 AZN loan.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1275,"image":{"id":955758,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seeds and fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Agjabadi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.5 47.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":56,"posted_date":"2012-01-01T08:02:00Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1275,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Guldasta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"AZN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.25},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.24},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":215.05,"local_amount":168.67,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:29:59Z","rounded_local_amount":169.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257117535},{"amount":103.78,"local_amount":81.4,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:29:03Z","rounded_local_amount":81.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263242645},{"amount":106.15,"local_amount":83.25,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:27:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269967629},{"amount":107.1,"local_amount":84,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":84.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276811700},{"amount":102.98,"local_amount":80.77,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-19T07:45:35Z","rounded_local_amount":80.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283775372},{"amount":107.09,"local_amount":83.99,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:20:23Z","rounded_local_amount":84.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286799877},{"amount":107.48,"local_amount":84.3,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-17T08:00:45Z","rounded_local_amount":84.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294278547},{"amount":94.34,"local_amount":73.99,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":74.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301331423},{"amount":106.42,"local_amount":83.47,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:01:18Z","rounded_local_amount":83.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308088388},{"amount":224.61,"local_amount":176.16,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":176.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315322649}],"funded_date":"2012-01-06T16:48:19Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T11:20:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":382242,"name":"Karem Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Karem es una joven emprendedora, est\u00e1 estudiando Psicolog\u00eda, el pr\u00e9stamo ser\u00e1 usado para pagar el curso de titulaci\u00f3n de finalizaci\u00f3n de sus estudios, sus padres le apoyaran en al pago del cr\u00e9dito.

She started out more than twenty years ago selling candy and cigarettes in front of the bus terminal.  After several years of hard work, she obtained a small loan from Banco Popular and set up a small stand selling watches and cosmetics.  She started selling some clothing from her makeshift hut of wood, cardboard and plastic.  She added cheap toys to the mix and continued to grow the business.  Norma is the single mother of two--one in grade school and the other in high school.  Thanks to many years of effort she has seen her children advance and provided a humble home for them.  <p> <b> Translated by a Kiva volunteer. <\/b> <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nEsta se\u00f1ora posee un peque\u00f1o, pero bien surtido negocio de mercader\u00eda en general ubicado en el mercado de la terminal de Le\u00f3n.

It is in this way that she has spent 20 years offering her photography services. She is very well-known because of her experience.

Soledad-Atl\u00e1ntico, inicia el d\u00eda moliendo carne bien sazonada y con la cual rellena una tripa natural prealistada, sometida a altas temperaturas, que amarra con un hilo de pita, para darle su singular forma de cadeneta; es as\u00ed como la prepara para la cocci\u00f3n y apertura de orificos, a fin de que posteriormente se recoja y quede lista para degustarla.  De esta manera Antonio, elabora un embutido artesanal, llamado \u201cButifarra\u201d t\u00edpico de Soledad \u2013Atl\u00e1ntico, donde la proliferaci\u00f3n de estas unidades artesanales ha ido disminuyendo, pues actualmente  ha sido copiado y forma parte de la l\u00ednea de producto de grandes empresas carnicas que son su m\u00e1xima competencia; aunque como lo expresa Antonio, a esas industrias no le queda este producto con el exquisito sabor coste\u00f1o y por eso su clientela sabe lo que come, lo prefieren y lo buscan en el municipio de Soledad, el cual se ha hecho famoso por este producto inspirador de t\u00edpicas y hermosas canciones compuestas por artistas de nuestra Regi\u00f3n Atlanticense e incluidas en \u00e1lbumes  \u201cJoyas de la M\u00fasica Colombiana\u201d.\n\nAntonio, lleg\u00f3 a Barranquilla, procedente de Pedraza-Bol\u00edvar su tierra natal, donde se dedicaba a labores del campo, pero su deseo de encontrar un mejor futuro hizo que se trasladara a la Capital del Atl\u00e1ntico; fue as\u00ed como trabaj\u00f3 en la venta de cocadas inicialmente y luego en una microempresa ubicada en el Municipio de soledad, dedicada a lo que hoy es su \u00fanico ingreso familiar \u201cla fabricaci\u00f3n y comercializaci\u00f3n de butifarreras\u201d, actividad con la que ha logrado darle educaci\u00f3n a sus hijos en compa\u00f1\u00eda de sus esposa. Aunque \u00e9l, no estudi\u00f3, aprendi\u00f3 a firmar y a trabajar con amor, para educar a sus  3 hijos  pensando en que  estudiando construir\u00edan un mejor futuro, as\u00ed lleva 19 a\u00f1os vendiendo butifarra y su hija  menor, estudia en el Sena, una carrera t\u00e9cnica y tambi\u00e9n comercializa este producto. \n\nSu primer cr\u00e9dito con la Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo, lo  hizo hace 17 a\u00f1os por valor de $30.000, cuando conform\u00f3 con cuatro amigos el grupo solidario  llamado \u201cLuz de Luz\u201d. Desde ese momento el popular Antonio, ha recibido 14 cr\u00e9ditos, gradualmente aumentados en la medida de expansi\u00f3n de su mercado; su capacidad de trabajo y deseo de superaci\u00f3n permitieron que  en el a\u00f1o 1995 comprara un lote, para construir lo que hoy es su vivienda, la cual ha ido levantando poco a poco, con el producto de su trabajo en la fabricaci\u00f3n de la exquisita y muy Caribe butifarra. \n\nAntonio, es un experto en captar la atenci\u00f3n de clientes en espacios de gran afluencia p\u00fablica, con su hija vende al detalle en sitios muy estrat\u00e9gicos y es bien conocido como una persona responsable y honesta. Su pr\u00f3ximo cr\u00e9dito por valor de  $1.300.000 lo utilizar\u00e1 para  comprar materias primas e  insumos,  especialmente, carne de res, cerdo y pollo, para incluir variedad en la elaboraci\u00f3n del producto y poder vender en volumen, apoy\u00e1ndose en los vecinos del barrio donde vive, quienes tambi\u00e9n se han convertido en vendedores de su producto en los picos de alta productividad y comercializaci\u00f3n.\n\nSu  pr\u00f3ximo desaf\u00edo es continuar con las mejoras de su vivienda, especialmente piso, ba\u00f1o y pintura, el dice que el apoyo de su familia en el manejo del negocio es fundamental para que todo esto suceda.\n\n","en":"Antonio Mu\u00f1os begins his day in the early morning at his home in the Villa del Carmen neighborhood of Soledad-Atl\u00e1ntico, grinding seasoned meat which he uses to stuff natural sausage casings.  He ties the casings with string to form links.  He prepares it for cooking and later enjoying.  This is how Antonio prepares a delicious sausage called \u201cButifarra,\u201d typical in Soledad-Atl\u00e1ntico, where these small operations are going away and their culinary arts have been copied by large meat processing plants, which give great completion.  Antonio says that these companies\u2019 products are not as tasty, so his customers seek him out in Soledad and he has become famous for his product, which has lead to lovely inspirational songs by artisans form the Atlanticense region.  These songs have been included in the album \u201cJoyas de la M\u00fasica Colombiana\u201d (Jewels of Columbian Music).\r\n\r\nAntonia arrived in Barranquilla from his native land in Pedraza-Bol\u00edvar where has worked in the fields, but his desire for a better life inspired him to move to Atl\u00e1ntico where he initially sold \u201ccocadas,\u201d (sweetened meat candy).  He later worked in a small factory in Soledad, which make butifarra.  This allowed him and his wife to provide for his three children\u2019s educations.  Although he did not receive a formal education, he learned to work and write so that he could educate his children because he believes that a good education will give them a better future.  He has been selling butifarra for 19 years.  His youngest daughter studies in el Sena and also sells his product.  He got his first loan for $30 through \u201cla Fundaci\u00f3n Santo Domingo\u201d (The Santo Domingo Foundation) 17 years ago when he and four friends formed the group \u201cLuz de Luz\u201d (Light from Light).  Since then Antonio has received fourteen incrementally larger loans to expand his market.  His ability to work and desire to get ahead allowed him to buy a vacant lot in 1995. Little by little he built his home with the income he made from the sale of his delicious product.\r\n\r\nAntonio is an expert in attracting customers in wealthy areas.  He and his daughter sell in strategic locations and he is well known for being honest and responsible.  He will use the money from his next loan of $1,300 for supplies, especially beef, pork and chicken in order to offer greater variety and be able to sell in larger quantities and support his neighbors who also sell his product during the high season.  His next challenge is to continue improving his home, particularly the floors, bathroom and painting.  He says that his family\u2019s support in managing his business is important to seeing this through.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva

The members defined themselves as hard-working women who fight for their dreams to come true. They organized and formed this group for this very reason, so they could reach their goals. One of the members is Librada. She is 21 years old, has two children under school age, and makes a living selling all kinds of clothing. She says that she sacrifices all of her days for her children to assure them a dignified and decent life.

She owns a business venture, providing general  alteration & tailoring services to local community members.  Lolo has many years of experience in this business.  Lolo needs a loan of WST $1250 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 210 tala or US $88 per week) to make improvements to her house.\n\nIn 2008, Lolo joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Lolo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She lives in the city of La Romana, where the sugar cane harvest and tourist industry dominate the economy. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity.\r\n\r\nElena has been working for 13 years. At the start, she was selling miscellaneous products. Now she is running a butcher shop where she sells all kind of meats and sausages.  She also runs a vegetable stall in her community.

Because customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, the women lack tangible collateral assets, and financial institutions do not consider them to be credit-worthy. This leads to poor financial support and, as a result, limited access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

This is 37-year-old Asha Kasanqu from Mwanza, a beautiful city on the shores of Lake Victoria. (Lake Victoria is famous not only because it is one of the largest lakes in the world, but also because it feeds the Nile River, a very important source of life for Africa.) Asha is married and has 4 children between the ages of 2 and 17. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one other dependent. \r\n<p>\r\nFor the past 2 years Asha has been running a mama lishe. A mama lishe is a restaurant or caf\u00e9 in Tanzania that usually consists of a rough wooden table and some long wooden benches. The food is all local: rice, ugali (a hot sticky dough made from maize flour), and plantains (cooked savory bananas), all served with beans, vegetables, meat, and a variety of sauces. I was happy to discover she also serves up my favorite Tanzanian delight, vitumbuwa.  Vitumbuwa is made out of rice, sugar, water, and eggs (optional), and is deep-fried to create a slightly sweet, puffy yet dense pancake of sorts.  It is a \"must try\" if you ever find yourself in Tanzania!\r\n<p>\r\nAsha works at her business 6 days a week. She currently earns about $75 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of $400 in order to purchase ingredients for her menu items at her mama lishe, including rice, sugar, and cooking oil. Asha thanks you for supporting her business!\r\n<p>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:<br>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":224971,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase ingredients (such as rice, sugar, and cooking oil) for her restaurant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-13T01:40:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:13:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970757},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886974},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:52Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436234},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130506},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:36Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027303},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613323},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010406},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232717},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664533},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:08Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105264}],"funded_date":"2008-11-13T06:30:35Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Olson","image":null}},{"id":78200,"name":"Khalida M.maqbool Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Khalida baji is a 20 year old married woman and resides in Lahore, Pakistan.

She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Matuu has many years of experience in this business.  Matuu needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase a fishing boat.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 tala or US $104 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Matuu joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Matuu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Matuu I. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.99 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

This loan will increase the family's income through the sale of milk and enable him to repay the loan and meet the family's needs.\r\n\r\nIn future, he would like to improve his dairy farming by increasing the number of high yielding dairy cows and buying land to plant grass for the dairy cows.\r\n\r\nReuben is grateful to Juhudi for the services provided."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":559253,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase and insure a dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Litein","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2010-06-24T15:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reuben","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":45000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":16,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3750},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":3750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.91},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.92}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":47.28,"local_amount":3700,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:19:17Z","rounded_local_amount":3824.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172142355},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:57:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3876.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177437187},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:33:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3876.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182576557},{"amount":47.92,"local_amount":3750,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:18:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3876.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191450109},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:58:25Z","rounded_local_amount":7752.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195872184},{"amount":48.55,"local_amount":3800,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-21T08:09:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3928.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202030052},{"amount":95.19,"local_amount":7450,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-16T08:11:51Z","rounded_local_amount":7701.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211446682},{"amount":144.39,"local_amount":11300,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:24:17Z","rounded_local_amount":11681.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216535632}],"funded_date":"2010-06-26T05:11:59Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:24:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":214247,"name":"Maribel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maribel, de 23 a\u00f1os, es una joven muy alegre y sencilla, vive en casa de sus padres junto a su esposo Jaime de 26 a\u00f1os y su \u00fanico hijo Yosmel de 3 a\u00f1os, quienes son el motivo de todos sus esfuerzos.

His business is a telephone call center but he also sells candy and cookies.  In addition, he has a stand in downtown Barranquilla where he sells CDs and cell phone accessories.\r\n\r\nHe began his business when he recognized the need that existed in his area.  He used to sell lottery tickets and acquired an important customer base that way.  He had a sales team for over 30 years.\r\n\r\nRoberto is from Carmen de Bol\u00edvar where he used to be an employee until he started to work for himself.  All of this business ability arose because he is the first-born son of a family and the absence of his father required him to start working from a very early age; he needed to be responsible in order to help his mother.\r\n\r\nSince 2002 he created his own way of earning an income.  Later, he started collaborating with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo which has granted him 3 loans to date that have made it possible for him to increase his working capital and profits that have helped him meet household expenses, buy furniture, home appliances and make home improvements (which started out as an empty lot he bought and gradually has been using savings and much effort to build his home).\r\n\r\nHe is now asking for a Kiva loan in the amount of #1.300.000 to buy calling plans with more minutes included because his market has grown and the ones he has are insufficient; he also wants to buy CDs and MP3s to sell.\r\n\r\nHis goal is to grow as a person and to add computers to his business.  Although he knows that his main challenge is the minimal capital he works with, he also has other challenges like helping his daughter finish her university education; she is currently in the 8th semester of Computer Sciences.\r\n\r\nHe is very happy with the location of his business because he is very well known there and surrounded by calm neighbors who like to get along with each other.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

In spite of her young age she works daily with the only goal to find progress.  That's why a year ago she joined a group knitting ladies of the area where she lives, together they make all kinds of products that they sell in and outside the country.  She knits different types of purses and handbags, also bracelets and necklaces and likes her work because she can do it from the comfort of her home and obtain income.  Every week she makes a number of knitted products and sells them to the wholesalers of the city.  Prices vary according to the destination of the merchandise.  What Cynthia doesn't like is having to work for other people knowing that if she made the final sale herself she would obtain higher income.   She is a young entrepreneur and has planned for the future to open a bookstore and bazaar in a marketplace of the zone because she wishes to have her own business.  This is the first loan with MFP and she promises to make her payments punctually because she doesn't want to let down the people that made possible the money that will allow her to continue working in the search for progress.

She resides with her husband and six of their children in Hamdallaye Extension, a working-class district in Sikasso City (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Not having had the chance to advance in school due to societal reasons, she soon became introduced to dyeing cloth and selling damask fabrics. She learned to dye cloth over twenty years ago from her older [sister]. She is in high demand, especially by her customers (essentially comprising travelers, bus drivers, truckers, etc.), for the quality of her products. \r\n\r\nConcerned about further satisfying her burgeoning customer base,  Bah Oumou decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso about six years ago. She is now on her sixth individual loan. All the previous loans have been properly repaid. \r\n\r\nThis sixth loan will enable her to buy 3 lengths of white \u201cRiche Hollandais\u201d damask, 15 containers of dyes of various colors, 15 packets of caustic soda, etc. She gets her supplies in Bamako and also in Sikasso from major merchants. She puts the fabrics into the dye, and so she  sells them, for cash on special order. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she envisions making a monthly profit of 200,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to increase her working capital, to help cover family expenses, and to pay the interest on the loan. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":783473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy damask cloth, caustic soda, dyes, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-06-03T03:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bah Oumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:51Z","rounded_local_amount":102362.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120274},{"amount":225,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":102362.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699197},{"amount":225,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:57Z","rounded_local_amount":102362.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874266},{"amount":225,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-04T08:24:50Z","rounded_local_amount":102362.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424484}],"funded_date":"2011-06-03T06:12:29Z","paid_date":"2012-05-04T08:24:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":308498,"name":"Zaitun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zaitun is a married woman with five children, two of whom attend school.

He works as a solar lamp distributor in Mali.\n\nPrior to becoming a distributor for NOTS, Daniel studied agriculture and engineering and worked as a farm manager at a Malian textile company.   Upon learning about the work of NOTS Mali, he was very motivated to become a distributor because he knew solar lamps would be a great benefit to people living in the rural areas where he lived and worked.  \n\nDaniel sells solar lamps directly to farmers and through small retailers and individual entrepreneurs in Sikasso, the southern-most region in Mali.   Most people living in this area work in agriculture and about 80% of the population does not have access to electricity.  They rely, instead, on kerosene, flashlights and candles for light and they must walk long distances and pay to charge their mobile phones.  On top of being harmful to the environment, time-consuming, and damaging to users health (inhaling kerosene fumes is like smoking 2 packs of cigarettes a day), these energy sources are expensive, costing a family about $110 per year - $80 for kerosene and $30 to charge a mobile phone.   \n\nA solar lamp that provides up to 16 hours of light, can charge a mobile phone and has a lifetime of about 5 years costs just $35.  Purchasing a solar lamp is a win-win - families benefit because they save time, money and they are safer and healthier and the environment benefits from less toxic waste and reduced CO2 emissions caused by kerosene use.  \n\nThe funds from Kiva investors will allow Daniel to purchase 570 solar lamps and sell them to cotton and sesame farmers on credit.  These lamps will impact almost 4,000 lives.  Harvest season starts in September, so it is a good time for Daniel to sell lamps as the farmers will have some money to pay for the lamps.  It is difficult, however, for them to pay in one lump-sum payment, so Daniel will collect payments in installments.  This way farmers can access solar light without so much financial strain on their household.\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1432179,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":2881,"youtubeId":"YpzycAZDKJ4","title":"Kiva Borrower Daniel from Mali","thumbnailImageId":1432179},"activity":"Goods Distribution","sector":"Wholesale","themes":["Green","Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy solar lamps that he will sell to cotton and sesame farmers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":332,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":20050,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":9828160,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":20050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":9828160}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20050}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Janessa Karawan","image":1204200}},{"id":751688,"name":"Soeurng's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Soeurng,40, is a local famer residing in Battambang province.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling baked goods in the local community. Lotu has been engaged in this business for more than six years and earns approximately 250 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Lotu joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lotu has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Lotu is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST, which will also be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This will be the fifth loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Lotu plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand his business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 32 years old. Letecia is separated from her spouse and has two young children. To make a living, Letecia owns and operates a business making and selling food. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Letecia has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Letecia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Letecia is requesting a loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Letecia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

C. lives and does business in Baclaran - a commercial district between the cities of Paranaque and Pasay City.  She is 55 years old and lives with her two children.\r\n<p> \r\nLeticia owns and manages a bakery which is open to customers twenty-four hours a day (24\/7).  She also has a general store where she sells banana cue and coconuts.  She opened her bakery a few years ago with only an assistant working at the oven.  Now her bakery employs nine bakers who rotate as store attendants as well.  She earns at least P30,000 a day from the combined operations of the bakery and the general store. \r\n<p>\r\nShe has just finished repaying her previous loan with the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative.  The easy-to-pay and low-interest loans provided by the cooperative allow her to purchase bakery supplies and store merchandise in bulk amounts, saving her a lot of time and money.  She has currently applied for a new loan in the amount of P48,000 to use as additional capital for her businesses.  \r\n<p>\r\nLeticia believes that education would be the best gift she could give her children, so she works hard to better improve her businesses.  She finds fulfillment in that from her profits and savings, she is able to send her children to reputable schools.  \r\n<p>\r\nAbout CCT\r\n<p>\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \r\n<p>\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":433842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

She is starting a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Petimani needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 195 tala or US $81 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Petimani joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Petimani's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Petimani E. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.89 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.66 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.1 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She's the mother of two school-attending children. The couple lives with their children. Zinatou and her husband support the family expenses together.\r\n\r\nTo help with the family expenses, Zinatou's main business consists in selling corn and rice, as well as soaps.
