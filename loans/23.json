Aside from being so busy attending to her own three children, ages from eight to 12 years old, she is also busy teaching other children in their community about religion. When Jocelyn decided to join ASHI, she first asked her husband for his opinion.  With her husband\u2019s approval, she joined the group of five women in their village who have the same intention as hers. After she was recognized as a member, she submitted her request for a loan, which she will use to purchase a hog\/pig for fattening. After four months of raising her hog\/pig, she will be able to see her profit because by then, the hog will be sold either live or slaughtered. Once it is sold, Jocelyn will get her capital from it and will again buy another hog.  With that opportunity, Jocelyn feels happy that through the ASHI and Kiva partnership, there is a possibility for her to be funded with a much larger amount of loans in the future to be able to really grow her business. That will allow her to have more income, which will be used to support her dream of graduating her children from college and to improve their standard of living."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":496032,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Her friendliness, charisma, and good service have made her store a favorite among her neighbors and customers who make their purchases early in the morning, because hers is the first store to open and the last to close.\r\n\r\nWhat she enjoys most about her work is conversing with her neighbors about the things that go on in the neighborhood.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ni Nyoman is requesting for the first time a loan from MUK in the amount of 3,000,000 IDR which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future.  Ni Nyoman plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nShe also dreams of seeing all of her sons succeed and for MUK, she hopes than she can get a lower interest rate for next loan--maybe under 1 %.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout MUK:\r\n\r\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation and loans, thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nNi Nyoman K. (PK-10299) merupakan 48 tahun wanita.  Dia (perempuan) tinggal di kota Melaya - Bali.  Dia (perempuan) menikah dan memiliki 2 anak usia dewasa.  Untuk membiayai hidup, Ni Nyoman memiliki & menjalankan usaha.  Bisnis beroperasi di sektor pertanian.  Tujuan utama bisnis tersebut adalah memelihara ternak.  Meskipun bukan satu-satunya sarana untuk menghasilkan pendapatan, sumber utama penghasilan bisnis tersebut terutama berasal dari beternak babi untuk dijual.  Ni Nyoman sudah menjalankan bisnis ini selama lebih dari 7 tahun.  Dari kegiatan-kegiatan ini, Ni Nyoman menghasilkan sekitar 500,000 IDR sebulan.\r\n\r\n\r\nDalam 2010, Ni Nyoman bergabung MUK untuk mendapatkan akses ke layanan keuangan untuk membantu meningkatkan  -nya kondisi kehidupan dan kemampuan untuk menjalankan kegiatan bisnis.  Ni Nyoman telah berhasil melunasi pinjaman sebelumnya dari MUK.    Dia (perempuan) sekarang meminta pinjaman baru sebesar 3,000,000 IDR.  Pinjaman saat ini akan digunakan untuk untuk membeli bibit ternak untuk dibesarkan & dijual di masa mendatang.  Pinjaman ini akan menjadi 1st pinjaman yang diambil oleh peminjam dari MUK.  Ni Nyoman berencana untuk menggunakan pendapatan tambahan yang dihasilkan dari bisnis  untuk meningkatkan\/memperluas bisnis peminjam.\r\n\r\n\r\nTentang MUK:\r\n\r\nMisi Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) adalah untuk membantu usaha kecil di Bali dengan memberikan perlatihan, konsultasi bisnis, dan pinjaman uang, dengan demikian membantu pemilik usaha dan keluarga mereka memperbaiki hidup sehari-hari.\r\n\r\nPesan untuk Peminjam Kiva: Grup ini memakai model pinjaman komunitas\/\"\"community lending\"\" (biasanya dijuluk Bank Desa\/\"\"Village Banking\"\") yang populer di Asia. Di model ini, sejumlah representatif dari grup akan meminjam uang sejumlah lebih besar untuk seluruh grup (kadang-kadang seluruh desa). Representatif ini akan distribusi dan mengendalikan pinjaman, dan mengkoleksi pembayaran untuk peminjam akhir. Ini adalah praktek umum dan efisien di daerah ini, tapi merumitkan cara lapor untuk Kiva. Tidak serupa pinjaman lain, partner Kiva, MUK, akan menjadi kontak utama dengan tim kepemimpinan grup, yang sebaliknya menjadi kontak dengan peminjam akhir. Demikian, jurnal yang ditulis akan merefleksikan hasilnya tim kepemimpinan, bukannya peminjam-peminjam akhir.\r\n\r\nUntuk belajari lebih banyak tentang Village Banking di Wikipedia, mohon kunjungi website ini: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Village_Banking..  \t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":596999,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-09-09T20:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.59},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":14.58}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":17.03,"local_amount":146000,"processed_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":153555.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177441012},{"amount":332.97,"local_amount":2854000,"processed_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":3001694.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182580949}],"funded_date":"2010-09-09T23:30:00Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:48:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":233736,"name":"Norma's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norma P. is from the village of San Roque, Enrile, Cagayan.

that could yield enough money to support his wife and family for the long term, particularly so that his children can finish their studies. For this reason, he took what little savings he had and started his own bread \u201clepeshka,\u201d a bakery business at home. With only a few utensils and clients but with faith and enthusiasm, he has made his business successful by growing a loyal clientele little by little. However, Ravshan wishes to offer his clients better services so that they do not seek other competing businesses. He also wants to be able to attract more clients. He is therefore requesting a loan in the amount of $1,000 USD. With this money, Ravshan will be able to buy more products for making lepeshka and will be able to make improvements to his offerings. With these improvements, Ravshan expects to attract more clients and will be capable of supporting his family and continuing to fund his children\u2019s studies. His goal is to be able to offer a better future to his family.   \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and being the location of the end of the rule of Alexander the Great. It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

To that end, she applies high standards of cleanliness when preparing the food she sells. She would like to expand her business in order to better satisfy costumer demand. This is the first time she has applied for a loan from Edpyme Alternativa; she has asked for 1000 new soles. She will use the money to buy food supplies for her food business. \r\n\r\nRosa is a hard-worker and very responsible and dedicated to her family. Her greatest wish is to provide her young children with the opportunity for a better future through a university profession. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Montserrat Zuckerman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":505872,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy food supplies to make hamburgers and salchipollos.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-03-15T18:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":46.38},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.34},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":47.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":48.04},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":48.19},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":48.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":49.11},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":49.47},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":49.69},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50.21},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50.95},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.23},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":51.7},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":52.08},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":52.47},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":52.69},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":53.21},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":53.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.39},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.63},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.88},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.02},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.07},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.28},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.42},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.55},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.63},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.97},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.21},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.53},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.68},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.76},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.95},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":88.67,"local_amount":236.45,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:42Z","rounded_local_amount":249.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934686},{"amount":73.32,"local_amount":195.52,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:13Z","rounded_local_amount":205.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662308},{"amount":75.54,"local_amount":201.43,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:07Z","rounded_local_amount":212.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695012},{"amount":97.56,"local_amount":260.17,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":274.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878057},{"amount":39.91,"local_amount":106.43,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:39Z","rounded_local_amount":112.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618085}],"funded_date":"2010-03-15T21:32:54Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":188686,"name":"Epifania","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Epifania A. is from the village of Mambajao, Camiguin Province.

He rents a house with his wife Nidia, 27, and their 2 young children, to whom he wishes to provide a better quality of life. Farming has been a crucial part of Edwin's life. Since he was very young, Edwin's parents taught him that farming would provide him with everything he needed, which is why he decided to continue the work. He now has his own farm of potatoes and peas, which he sells in Tarma's wholesale market after harvest.\r\n\r\nEdwin started his farm 5 years ago and really enjoys the planting season. His family depends on his work for economic security. Climate changes affect his yield, so he tries to take good care of his crops. Edwin hopes to keep working and improving his crops. This is his 4th loan with MFP and he knows how important it is to the development of his work. In his community group Edwin is very responsible, which has earned him a lot of respect. With the 3,000 PEN loan he is requesting, Edwin will buy fertilizer to improve his harvest.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":565451,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-11T12:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":3034.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195426}],"funded_date":"2010-07-11T19:38:34Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vivian Lu","image":225936}},{"id":217364,"name":"Efua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Efua B. sells bags of water and soft drinks at Elmina.

Her husband is a lecturer and they have two children, 4 and 9 years old. Selina owns a cement distribution shop, where she supplies builders around the Kitengela area, an upcoming residential area where many buildings are being constructed.  Besides this business, she also has a container which she rents out to other people to use as a shop. She says that this business is profitable and the only major challenge she faces is competition from many people in the area doing the same kind of business as hers. She says that there are other people in Kitengela who are well established and own big hardware stores and even provide transport facilities.

Faced with the challenges of working hand in hand with her husband to take care of their kids, she finds it difficult to sponsor their education.  Due to her own lack of education, she could not secure a good job, so she embarked on farming.  \n  \nUnfortunately, she was not familiar with farming methods that could improve her output.  As a member of GHAPE, she was fortunate to acquire some techniques that have helped her improve on her farming and marketing strategies.\n\nNgwa F. has been successful at managing and paying back her previous loans.  With a new loan, she plans to invest it in farming and the selling of vegetable, garri (also known as tapioca), yams and potatoes.\n\nHer activities will help her community, as she will be able to supply the market with basic foodstuff. She will plow her profit back into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to pay her children;s school fees, and will save some for rainy days. Ngwa F. prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the instalmental method paying back the loan.\n\nAbout GHAPE \nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multifaceted approach.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects.

Muzaffar is 40 years old. He is married and has three children of school age. His wife is a teacher in a secondary school. \r\n\r\nMuzaffar manufactures national cradles. National cradles in Tajikistan are very colorful. They are made of wood. As a rule, the national cradle is presented by the grandparents when the baby is forty days old, and this event is celebrated by the entire family. \r\n\r\nMuzaffar has been in this business for seventeen years. His wife helps him. The completed cradles are purchased from their house. The stability of the business allows a steady income which ensures that the family has the possibility of improving their living conditions.\r\n\r\nMuzaffar has been working with IMON for four years. For the entire period of time he has shown himself as a successful client, managing his loans with accuracy and precision. Today Muzaffar requests a loan in the amount of $1500 in order to purchase more planks and paints for producing more cradles. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He had to drop out of his primary studies, and at the age of 15, he started his training as a tapestry-maker. At the end of his training, he could not get set up because he had no money to buy the necessary equipment, so he has to rent a sewing machine by the day, which he sets up on the side of the road to work. This is not at all profitable for him, because the cost for renting the machine is too high. Mr. A. therefore keeps sinking further into poverty with each passing day, despite his intelligence and creativity. He is currently asking for $950 in financial support, which would allow him to open and equip a workshop. The credit he is seeking would be enough to rent a workshop, and also to buy a sewing machine and other tapestry tools. With all of this, he would be able to have a stable income to meet the needs of his family.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Lisa Molle, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMonsieur A. Y.

She is 42 years old and the mother of six children, one of whom is a mirror cutter while the others two are sellers and the others are attending the local school. \nAll the members in this group loan are end-of-term loans so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loans term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make their payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s client make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":402719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To ask for a loan to buy fertilizer to support the rice field.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:33Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hoem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ert","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hann","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Han","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hieb","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nich","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khorn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Srey Naet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mom","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Sok Na","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":4100000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":4100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":2.63,"local_amount":10800,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":11002.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103739129},{"amount":2.32,"local_amount":9500,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":9678.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110626940},{"amount":24.39,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:26:45Z","rounded_local_amount":101878.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123862759},{"amount":48.78,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:05:46Z","rounded_local_amount":203756.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128895792},{"amount":24.39,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:12:07Z","rounded_local_amount":101878.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151840600},{"amount":319.51,"local_amount":1310000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:29:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1334602.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166791847},{"amount":577.98,"local_amount":2369700,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:32:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2414204.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172059380}],"funded_date":"2009-11-05T20:08:50Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T09:32:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":146991,"name":"Ziggida Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ziggida United is a group of five borrowers led by Gayduo Y., who is 29 years old and married with two children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Kasiyet is 46 years old, and has four children \u2013 three sons and one daughter.  Her two eldest sons are builders and her third son is disabled and usually helps her in agriculture. Her husband works in a local school as a security guard. Kasiyet has a business selling food. Prior to starting her business, she worked in Moscow for five years. Soon after her return to her village, she commenced this business. She started with just 20K KGS and now her turnover is about 150K KGS. Kasiyet has much experience of working with loans as although this is her first loan with Kiva partner, Mol Bulak Finance, she has previously received loans from other MFIs. This loan will be used to buy 180 kilos of sugar. In the near future, she plans to open a second outlet.\r\n<br>Santalathon, 46, is married with three children. Her husband and only son are working in Russia, and send about $100 almost every month. She fattens cattle and sells them later at the local market. She will use her loan to buy five sheep. She has some free time and wants to spend it most effectively, so that is why soon she will open a little food kiosk near her house. \r\n<br>Mashraphon is a mother of two sons. She lives with her husband and children in a big village near Osh city. Her husband is a security guard at Manas school, and he also uses his car to provide passenger transportation services. All the family members look after the animals at home. They have a very good yard in which they fatten cattle and sheep. Mashraphon's loan will be used to buy sheep.\r\n<br>K.

Elmira is going to spend a lot of her time improving and stabilizing her business.\r\n<br>Jangybek is the only male member of this group and this is his first ever loan. Previously he worked for a few years in Russia.

She does not have a fixed stall, so she is forced to get up early every market day to get hold of a place and earn the necessary income to proviD. for her family. She lives in rented accommodation, but her greatest desire is to proviD. her daughter with a home where she can better live in comfort.\r\n\r\nThe other group members sell fruit, shampoo, food, skirts, clothes in general, and passenger transportation services. The ladies work hard in a competitive environment and are eager to succeed. Most of the ladies will use their share of the loan to increase their working capital and better face competition. This is the group's second loan cycle with the microfinance institution Fundaci\u00f3n AgroCapital and its members know how to manage their funds to succeed and grow.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

To make a living, Jackielyn owns and operates a business venture in the food sector operating a retail and wholesale of \"chicharon\" (deep- fried pork rinds). While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling crispy fried pork rind in the local community. \r\n\r\nJackielyn has been engaged in her business for over one year. She also has a direct selling business for almost three years. Both these businesses earn her around 6,000 PHP a month. She hopes that Kiva lenders will continue to support her throughout her fourth loan cycle.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Jackielyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jackielyn is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Jackielyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

With each harvest, they have achieved good quality crops that are in high demand at the wholesale market in the city. What she enjoys most about her work is caring for her crops and protecting them from pests that can impact her harvest.

She is married to Freddie S., a driver, and is the mother of a young adult currently enrolled in college and a youngster enjoying his high school days. By the grace of God, Chuchie has managed to support her older child's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to send her youngest to college. This is the dream of most Filipino parents like Chuchie, who herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n<br>Chuchie operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that sells groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal in the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Chuchie earns an income by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling at piece rate. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and local community members. She earns a minimum of 250 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<br>To help her continue to operate her business, Chuchie is requesting a loan of 12,000 PHP. She will be using the loan to buy more products, such as groceries, toiletries and beverages, to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. Chuchie dreams of being able to give all her children a good, high quality education through all her hard work in her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n<p>\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":597084,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To expand her product inventory by purchasing groceries, toiletries and beverages","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-09-10T09:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chuchie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:52:57Z","rounded_local_amount":4075.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172089078},{"amount":73.33,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3260.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380442},{"amount":110,"local_amount":4800,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:23Z","rounded_local_amount":4890.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816778}],"funded_date":"2010-09-12T09:26:36Z","paid_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":233784,"name":"Rita Esmeralda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Rita Esmeralda M.

She lives in Danao City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2010 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 6,800. Algrace is borrowing PHP 10,000 so that she can continue to fund the operations of her business. This will be her third loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Algrace aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

married and has two adult children. He lives and works in Nikopol. Vladimir trades in man's sportswear. One of his clients suggested that he move his business from the market to a store where his goods do not get worn out and beaten up, and so he did.  Vladimir has a spacious shop in a convenient place on a main thoroughfare. In the city, very few people sell such an assortment and quantity of sportswear. In the shop there is an air conditioner, TV, air ionizer, and good lighting. Additionally, there is a great deal of opportunity to pay attention to every single customer.  \r\n\r\nVladimir has been selling clothes for seven years. He makes 27,000 hryvnias. Vladimir regularly buys new goods to maintain his inventory.  The more variety he has, the more he can profit.  Vladimir plans to use his 17,500 hryvnia loan to buy track suits, shorts, T-shirts, tennis shoes, and deck shoes. He knows that sportswear promotes a more healthy way of life for youth since many buy clothes for jogging, working in gyms, and skiing. Vladimir plans to expand his shop to display and sell more goods.   \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":819816,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":" to buy track suits, shorts, T-shirts, tennis shoes, and deck shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Nikopol","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.566667 34.4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2011-07-21T15:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vladimir","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":17500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2916},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2916},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2916},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2916},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2916},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2920}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.58},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.59},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":366.58},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":366.58},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":366.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":367.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":366.58,"local_amount":2916,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T08:09:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2929.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221700237},{"amount":366.59,"local_amount":2916,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:36:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2929.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227070069},{"amount":366.58,"local_amount":2916,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-16T08:05:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2929.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232975128},{"amount":366.58,"local_amount":2916,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:37:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2929.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238642546},{"amount":733.67,"local_amount":5836,"processed_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:15:07Z","rounded_local_amount":5863.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244596975}],"funded_date":"2011-07-30T02:15:07Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:15:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Melissa Kniazeva","image":1694640}},{"id":323944,"name":"Rosa Abigail","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rosa, vive con su hija D. 22 a\u00f1os D. edad, ella se dedica a la elaboraci\u00f3n D. tortillas y venta D. tamales, adem\u00e1s venD. atol, todos los d\u00edas realiza las ventas en las zonas cerca D. su vivienda.\nElla solicita un pr\u00e9stamo para la compra D. ma\u00edz, le\u00f1a, pollo y materiales para mejorar la vivienda, este pr\u00e9stamo contribuir\u00e1 no solamente en el negocio, sino que tambi\u00e9n mejorar las instalaciones D. su vivienda.\nEl objetivo D. ella es poder alg\u00fan d\u00eda terminar D. construir su vivienda, ya que a\u00fan le quedan varias cosas que construir.\n","en":"Rosa lives with her 22-year old daughter, and supports her family by selling tortillas, tamales and atol, selling her products in her neighborhood.\r\nShe now seeks a loan to buy corn, chicken and firewood for her business, as well as materials to repair her home, putting the capital to good use for both her business and to improve her housing conditions.

Income \/ profit received by Ardani also increases to Rp60,000-80,000 (about US$7-()\/daily.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nBerprofesi sebagai pedagang sayur dan makanan sudah dilakukan Ardani sejak 2 tahun yang lalu.  Berawal dari hoby memasak dan banyaknya waktu luang yang di miliki.   Istri dari Putu Widana, yang sampai saat ini belum di karuniai anak ini memulai mengisi waktu luangnya dengan membuat berbagai jenis masakan seperti: sayur, kue dan ikan . Kemudian oleh Ardani semua masakannya itu di serahkan ke warung \u2013warung ataupun di titip pada pedagang sayur keliling yang ada di desanya. Melihat hasil yang di dapat oleh Ardani sangat menjanjikan , usaha ini dijadikan sebagai sumber pendapatan utama keluarganya saat ini. Keuntungan Rp 25.000, \/ hari yang di dapat oleh Ardani dirasakan kurang mencukupi kebutuhan keluarganya , hingga Ardani harus bekerja lebih keras lagi . Untuk mengembangkan usahanya Ardani meminjam modal dari Dinari , yang di pergunakan untuk membeli sebuah sepeda motor untuk menunjang kelancaran dari usahanya, karena dengan sepeda motor ini Ardani yang dulunya hanya menyerahkan hasil produksinya pada warung atau pedagang lain , kini Ardani  bisa menjual langsung kepada konsumen (pelanggan )dengan berkeliling di  desanya bahkan sampai keluar di desa-desa lain. Kegiatan ini dilakukan Ardani sampai dua kali sehari, yaitu pagi dari jam 5 sampai jam 8, dan sorenya mulai pukul 2  sampai 6 . Hasil \/ keuntungan yang di dapat Ardani pun meningkat yaitu berkisar Rp 60.000,- sampai Rp. 80.000 \/ hari

Surrounded by the jungle, with a small waterfall nearby, most would consider this exotic location the perfect vacation destination.  But the tranquil image is shattered by the reality of the poverty confronted in the small town of Imbert every day.  Grisel works everyday to provide meals and school materials for her three children (and a 4th on the way).  With her two small barbecues, she sets up shop at a popular intersection in town, where she sells Chicharrones (deep fried pork) and other meets.  With this loan, Grisel intends to purchase propane, paint for her BBQ, and a supply of raw meet and oils.  While her current business is selling food, she dreams of one day owning her own boutique clothing store.  \r\n<p>\r\nGrisel is the leader of a 10 person micro bank Mujeres de Fe, which means \"Women of Faith\".  Each of these unique Dominican entrepreneurs unite in solidarity, allowing them to access funding that they would otherwise never be able to receive on their own.  The concept of this group bank paying their loan together is to reduce the risk of one person defaulting, as the others members gladly help cover one another's payments in order to receive their next loan together.  As these 10 women embark upon their first ever loan from Esperanza, we are confident that they will all succeed in bettering their lives and the lives of their families with this loan.  One of the women in the group just began a small general store, one owns a small hair salon, and several of the others plan to sell clothing.\r\n<p>\r\nOn behalf of Grisel Yocast, the Mujeres de Fe group, and the entire team here at Esperanza International, we thank you for your support and awareness of the global issue of poverty, in which your efforts are helping to make a difference."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":181685,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase paint to decorate a barbecue, propane, and pork to be sold on the street.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Puerto Plata","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19.75 -70.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2008-08-01T19:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grisel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Altagracia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Crusita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Keisy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Louise","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-26T17:40:46Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":8333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":8333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":245.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":246,"local_amount":8338.98,"processed_date":"2008-09-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-27T07:13:37Z","rounded_local_amount":8436.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":338120},{"amount":246,"local_amount":8338.98,"processed_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-28T07:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":8436.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":371945},{"amount":245.5,"local_amount":8322.03,"processed_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T02:57:23Z","rounded_local_amount":8419,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5312788},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":8333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":8430.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9930335},{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":8333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":8430.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14854909},{"amount":245.84,"local_amount":8333.35,"processed_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":8430.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20394191}],"funded_date":"2008-08-12T17:40:46Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T08:13:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":60865,"name":"Patience","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patience is 46 years old and married with two children.

children.  For eight years, Khaled has been working as a tomato farmer.  He is seeking a loan from Kiva partner A. Majmoua in order to purchase tools for his work.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":407544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional ingredients in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Morogoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.816667 37.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hadija","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":155282,"name":"Jean Nepomscene","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jean Nepomscene is 20 years old and single, and he lives in the western province of Rwanda which is approximately 3 hours' drive from Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda.

She is grateful to the Movimiento Manuela de Ramos for helping her start her business, as well as those of many other women who wished to grow as entrepreneurs. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":467897,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"TO BUY  MATERIALS FOR MAKING HER EMBROIDERY AND PLASTIC TOYS TO SELL","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa Del Pilar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":216.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":433.34,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:44Z","rounded_local_amount":451.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954391},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:18Z","rounded_local_amount":225.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987412},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:12Z","rounded_local_amount":225.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713424},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:27Z","rounded_local_amount":225.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746502},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":216.65,"processed_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-27T07:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":225.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151929724}],"funded_date":"2010-02-01T16:31:06Z","paid_date":"2010-07-27T07:48:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":171793,"name":"Ulda Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ulda Maria tiene 38 a\u00f1os, esta joven tiene 4 hijos de los cuales solamente 2 est\u00e1n a su cargo.

He is a very kind and hard-working young man who lives in his parents' house together with his 18 year-old wife Gladis.  What he wants more than anything is to improve their quality of life.  From a very early age, River learned to work on the farm together with his parents who taught him everything that needs to be done in order to achieve a good crop.\r\n\r\nRiver now has his own land which he farms and takes cares of with a lot of love and patience.  He grows coffee, cacao and coca leaf.  He then takes his products to the market in the city of San Francisco to sell.  What he most likes about his work is harvesting his crops since he feels then that his hard work is bearing fruit.  River has been in this business for 3 years and he considers the most difficult part of his work to be protecting his crops from the insect infestations that can affect his production.  His biggest wish is to buy a car which he could use to transport his products to market.\r\n\r\nThis is River's first loan with MFP.  He knows that he must make his repayments on time and he is ready to do this.  He will use the 3,000 Peruvian soles he is requesting to buy more manure and insecticides to improve the quality of his crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":666052,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy manure and insecticides","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-15T16:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"River ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":256.38},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":262.09},{"due_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":271.58},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":289.27},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":291.87},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":304.37},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":313.45},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":326},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":336.59},{"due_date":"2011-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":348.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.87},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.92},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.31},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.58},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.07},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.32},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.82},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":120.61},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":93.34,"local_amount":260.49,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:54Z","rounded_local_amount":263.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725511},{"amount":92.8,"local_amount":258.99,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":261.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463639},{"amount":96.96,"local_amount":270.57,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":273.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887020},{"amount":103.66,"local_amount":289.27,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":292.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327377},{"amount":104.58,"local_amount":291.87,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:02Z","rounded_local_amount":294.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195942},{"amount":109.07,"local_amount":304.37,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:27Z","rounded_local_amount":307.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269614},{"amount":112.32,"local_amount":313.45,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:27Z","rounded_local_amount":316.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549614},{"amount":116.82,"local_amount":326,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":329.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718347},{"amount":120.61,"local_amount":336.59,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":339.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349914},{"amount":124.84,"local_amount":348.4,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":351.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850493}],"funded_date":"2010-12-19T18:06:35Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":262489,"name":"Mrs. Sao Yat Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In Dak Por village in Takeo province, there are 16 people who make up a village bank loan.

This helps in improving her business during these season and it\u2019s almost the same during the summer season since most of the citizens come to spend the summer season in their beloved village.\r\n\r\nSaada hopes to expand her business more and more in the future.

Ana is pictured in front of some of the beach hut accommodation which she has used her loans to help build. In the background can be seen the beach and Pacific Ocean. On the other side of the road can be found the caf\u00e9 which sits above the road but above very steep cliffs and waterfalls.

C. T. is a businesswoman who knows the value of diversification in her income streams. She traditionally has made and sold ice cream products such as helados, Gelatinas, and choco covered bananas. She realizes selling these kinds of foods has had limited opportunity for her so she is taking out this  loan with Friendship Bridge to expand into selling men\u2019s and women\u2019s casual clothing. She will use the loan to buy new clothing and resell it in the local market. She is strongly committed to providing a complete selection of desirable clothing to please her customers.\r\n<p>\r\nHer dream of growing this business little bit by little bit is now becoming a reality. She feels very satisfied that she now has the resources to work hard at her new business, which will result in improved quality of life for herself and her family. She can develop a growing business and pay off the loan simultaneously, a reality that signifies her dreams are being realized. She is very pleased with her prospects for the future.\r\n<p>\r\nHer personal life has its ups and downs. She is 51 years, she is married and has 7 children ranging in age from 17 to 32 years.  Although she cannot read or write she knows the importance of education. She is committed to insuring that the two youngest ones living at home complete their studies.

Because she had to work all day and didn\u2019t have anyone to take care of her daughters, she decided to work for herself in her own business.  Now she sells food out of her house in Laredo District, Trujillo Province in La Libertad state.  Seeing she lacked capital, Juana decided to become a member of the Mercado Modelo Community Bank.  She has worked with Manuela Ramos for four years.  She used her first loan of 300 soles [about US $100] to purchase a kitchen for her business. <p>\r\nWith a loan of 1,200 soles [about US $ 425], which will be paid back in six months, Juana plans to purchase one sack of potatoes, oil, rice, pasta, vegetable stock, etc.  Juana\u2019s goal is to start a business selling artisan goods from Chulucanas, a town in northern Peru, in the state of Piura.  According to Juana, her house once had no floor, but she has been able to upgrade her house thanks to the earnings from her business.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Todd M.

Members of her family in the north encouraged her to try selling in Lima, so that's how she began.  Now she brings shoes from the north and sells them by the dozen to various stores. She's been doing this for five years now and it's going very well.   Luisa needs a loan of 1,200 Sols in order to buy shoes, leather sandals that she brings from the north of the country.  Since she's been with FINCA Peru, things have gone well for her.  The loans she has received have helped a lot, and the talks she participates in at the Communal Bank have also been helpful.

She has a fruit stand next to the lake of Yarinacocha, the small town where she lives.  Luz also purchases fish from small fishing communities along the Ucayali, a wide brown river that flows past the nearby city of Pucallpa and joins the Amazon to the north.  Luz takes several-day-long trips upriver with a cooler and a bunch of ice to keep the fish fresh.  Upon return she sells everything she has purchased at the port of Pucallpa.  Luz sets up her fruit stand during holiday periods and in the winter when the river is high and purchasing fish becomes more difficult.  \r\n\r\nLuz has been working with Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for five years.  She hopes to invest this loan of 1000 soles in the purchase of more fish and fruits for her business ventures.  She will also save some of the loan to ensure that she can make all of her payments on time.    \r\n\r\nLuz is 48 years old and is a single mother of three adult children (ages 25, 27 and 29).  Although all of her children live with her, none is still dependent on her.  Luz also has three grandchildren.  \r\n\r\nAccording to Luz, things have gone very well for her working with Manuela Ramos.  Her credit has helped her a lot.  Her goal is to keep working and continue to expand her business ventures.  She hopes to someday purchase her own small passenger boat.  In this way, her son could have a job as its driver and Luz would not have to pay for her transport upriver on her fish-purchasing trips. \r\n\r\nLuz is pictured here at her fruit stand around the time of Peru's Independence Day holiday.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
