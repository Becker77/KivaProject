She sells fruit and vegetables in the municipal market where they live.  She has her stand located in a strategic spot in the market so she has many customers.  Besides, the fruit and vegetables she sells are fresh and of very good quality.  Reina is a very hardworking woman who likes to stay ahead of the competition.  For her, every trip, no matter how long, starts with a single step.  She wants to undertake her trip and make her business grow.  That\u2019s why she decided to take that first step and ask INTEGRAL for a loan that will allow her to buy oranges, mandarins, bananas, pineapples, tomatoes, onions, chilies and potatoes, among others.  Reina Esperanza is confident that she will bring economic security to her home this

The inhabitants make a living mainly by farming and petty trades. Mrs. Tran Thi Trang is the group leader of Group 10 consisting of 5 members. She has 3 children. The eldest son had to leave school early to work as a construction worker to support the  family. The two daughters are going to school. Her husband is 49 years old. He is in a weak health condition but still works as construction worker to support the family. She wishes to borrow VND2,442,600 (about USD140) to buy fruits to resell. This is her third loan. The previous loans, invested in buying and reselling fruits, were fully paid on time. Everyday, she goes to the city to buy fruits such as oranges, mandarins, apples, mango, pears to resell. In the seasons not good for fruit sales, she switches to sell vegetables to earn some money to pay for living costs of the family and send her children to school. Other members of the group also request for the same amount of loan, as below:\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Nguyen Thi Ha borrows to buy vegetables to resell\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Nguyen Thi Thoi borrows to invest in a

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She works in a factory, in the city of Kara Balta. Apart from the fact that she keeps cows and sells milk, she purchases cattle, fattens them up and resells them at the cattle market. Eight years ago her relatives gave her a calf as a present on her wedding anniversary. Then she invested 120 dollars in raising it. Now she makes around 150 dollars every month.\r\n\r\n\u201cI like what I do now, because it makes me independent and self-sufficient. Besides, I get great support and help from my husband and both of my daughters,\u201d says Nadira. Now she needs a loan to purchase a cow to increase the amount of milk she has for sale. In future, she hopes to increase her livestock population and have five cows for milking.\r\n\r\nNadira\u2019s partners are Izzatillo, Ajzada and Nazgul.\r\n\r\nIzzatillo is a teacher at a boarding school in Kara Balta city. A year ago he started selling consumer goods and some fruit like apples and lemons wholesale and retail. He has already bought a car for goods transportation. He needs a loan to purchase more fruit to wholesale and to start reselling new kinds of fruit: bananas, oranges and dried fruits. \r\n\r\nAjzada is thirty-six and works at a construction site as a general worker. As well, she sells milk, raises sheep and resells them at the Kara Balta cattle market. She wants to sell more milk; therefore she needs a loan to purchase a cow. Her dream is to buy a car and own a flat in the capital and she is determined to reach these goals.\r\n\r\nNazgul is just twenty-two. Nevertheless, she is married and has two kids. She works in \u201cBakai\u201d factory doing odd jobs. Some months ago she drew up a contract with a mobile company and opened a shop for a cellphone recharging. She wants to buy a heifer for raising and obtaining milk, so she is in need of a loan.

In her eyes we could see the sadness left by the loss of her husband who passed away 6 months ago. Together they had worked in their own fast food restaurant. \r\n<p>\r\nMatilde is 63 years old and with her husband, had 6 children. Right now they are her strength in this moment of sadness.  Matilde told us that she had been making fast food for 15 years and she didn\u2019t have to leave the house to do it. When her husband was alive, he fixed the front of their house so she could sell food from it. They started with a charcol grill and a few tables and chairs, from Thursday to Sunday, 5 in the afternoon until 8 in the evening attending to customers together with her daughther. Her daughter is still accompanying her in the house. \r\n<p>\r\nWith the loan that Matilde is going to receive, she is going to invest in her business. She is going to stock up on sodas, beers and beef. It hasn\u2019t been easy to maintain this business. She had thought of changing her business because there were times when her health was delicate and the doctor advised her to leave this business because the smoke was causing problems with her throat. Still, she is not going to leave this work and is thinking to start making empanadas, mocillas and typical dishes.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by karl baumgarten, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":443462,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To stock up on sodas, beers and beef","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-12-07T22:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Matilde De Los Dolores","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680089},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:29:04Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680090},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:52Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074601},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:46Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910590},{"amount":45.81,"local_amount":45.81,"processed_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:20Z","rounded_local_amount":45.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674570},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":45.83,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":45.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674571},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":91.66,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":91.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708779},{"amount":91.7,"local_amount":91.7,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":91.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159633011}],"funded_date":"2009-12-22T11:06:21Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"karl baumgarten","image":400656}},{"id":164134,"name":"Walter Enrique","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En el municipio de Somotillo, el se\u00f1or Walter R. con gran esfuerzo se dedica a trabajar arduamente con el fin de llevar el sustento a su casa de habitaci\u00f3n que mucho requiere de \u00e9l.

She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Siane has 5 years of experience in this business.  Siane needs a loan of WST $1500 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 120 tala or US $50 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Siane joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Siane's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Siane G. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.23 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

For the past 6 years she has sold traditional desserts in her region. When she first started she sold her products door to door but three years ago she set up a food stall. She sells her product every day until the very late hours of the evening. Every so often her son helps her to attend to clients. When she has sold out of her desserts she purchases more ingredients to prepare another batch. In the future she wants to produce more of her product to increase her earnings.

She earns her living by operating 3 businesses: an Internet cafe, cosmetic sales and tricycle. Her husband, Alfredo, who is 57 years old, works as a laborer to earn a living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are between 16 and 35 years old. \r\n\r\n<p>Elma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2003 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and her own efforts, Elma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 22,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 12th loan, she is borrowing PHP 27,000, which she intends to use to buy computer supplies in order to continue to save up for her children's future education. Elma is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in a monogamous family with her husband and children in the Darsalam I district of the city of Koutiala (Sikasso Region). A teacher in a Koutiala public school for over ten years, she also earns revenues from business, particularly the dyeing of cloth and selling dyed damask fabrics, that she learned from one of her service colleagues seven years ago.  She offers a range of cloth dyeing services for many requestors in her district and in the city.  She also receives orders from different professional organizations of Koutiala and from third parties. \r\n\r\nTo satisfy her customers and to generate more profit, she decided to turn towards the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso two months ago.  She is on her first individual loan, which will be used to buy five bolts of medium-rich damask, colorants (dyes), and some potash.  Supplies are gotten at the grand marketplace of Koutiala and often in Bamako (capital of Mali).  Sales are made in Koutiala City (in professional state organizations as much as in private organizations and in her district) to customers composed of women and men, cash or credit accepted. \r\n\r\nShe is counting on realizing a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used for repaying the loan, for supporting herself, and for investing the rest in her business.  Looking ahead, she intends to open a center for apprentices in cloth dyeing that demands sizable funding.  Her hopes rest upon Soro Yiriwaso and its partner, Kiva, for this plan to be realized.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

He sells the meat to the farming community from his temporary market stall alongside approximately 100 other vendors of various trades.  He has been running his business for 1 year.   He\u2019s taking a loan to purchase additional meat and also bags to transport it.  With the profits he dreams of first having a larger market stall and ultimately building a more permanent shop, and investing in the future of his children, especially school which he was fortunate to complete.  \n\n\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":384582,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase 1 carton of meat and bags for reselling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LR","country":"Liberia","town":"Lofa Co.

She is 42; is married; and is the mother of 5 children, whose ages range from 16- to 30-years-old.  All of them are in school except for the two oldest.  Celeste studied through 5th grade and had to stop because of the financial situation of her parents during the Portuguese colonial rule.  She grew up in the company of her two parents in the district of Namaacha in the Mafuiane region.  She only left there after she got married and went to live in the district of Boane with her husband.  He is in the military.  She lives in her own home with her three youngest children, and she doesn't have any additional family members to support.  She has her small business in the same area as her home.  She learned to do this activity with her friends in the year 2000.  She sells various products such as sugar, popcorn, cookies, beauty products, hygiene products, etc.  She has a monthly income of 6,000 meticais, which she puts towards supporting her family.  She also saves some money through a traditional savings group, which is known as xitque.  This is Celeste's second loan, and it is for 20,000 meticais.  She will use it to buy and sell basic products (popcorn, soap, cookies, beauty products, etc.).  She believes that by raising the volume of her business, she will be able to earn more money and increase the satisfaction of her customers.  Her first loan was for 15,000 meticais, which she used for the same purpose.  She received information about Hluvuku-Adsema through neighbors and other clients of the institution.  She is promising, just as with her previous credit, to repay the loan without any problems to be able to receive more credits in the future with the objective of growing her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":393731,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase merchandise (cookies, sugar, flour, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-09-25T22:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Celeste Mucavela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":878.85},{"due_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":918.58},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":960.1},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1003.51},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1048.87},{"due_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1096.28},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1145.84},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1197.64},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1251.78},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1308.37},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1367.51},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1429.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1493.95},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1561.48},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1632.07},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1705.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.96},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.44},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.01},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.63},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.11},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.97},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.91},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.94},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.07},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.28},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.02},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.56},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.2},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":118.36,"local_amount":3156.16,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3210.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971846},{"amount":122.4,"local_amount":3263.95,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3320.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816784},{"amount":123.14,"local_amount":3283.8,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":3340.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708967},{"amount":386.1,"local_amount":10296.09,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":10473.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938016}],"funded_date":"2009-09-26T02:21:03Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":143475,"name":"Margaret  Njeri","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Margaret is married to Julius and they have no children yet.\n\nMargaret has been in the business of selling second hand clothes for five years.

She owns a business venture, raising cattle for sale.  Ieni has many years of experience in this business.  Ieni needs a loan of WST $1500 to expand shelter for the borrower's livestock.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 800 tala or US $333 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Ieni joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Ieni's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Ieni P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMON\u2019s History<\/b>\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The most difficult aspect of her work is transporting her crop from the field to the collection centers located in the cities of Santa Rosa and San Francisco, places that offer the best prices for her products.\r\n\r\nMarlim\u2019s other difficulty is that she does not have sufficient income to pay in advance the day laborers who provide help removing the weeds that grow in her fields. This is the reason she has taken out loans from MFP, however now her priority is to cultivate more coffee because it is one of the plants in greatest demand on the market. This will be her second loan and she has been very punctual in making her earlier payments. She hopes to benefit one more time in order to grow her business.

His wife Vacelisa died two years ago, and since then he has worked hard to ensure that his children lack for nothing. He lives with his children in a simple house that belongs to him in an area adjacent to Pumpuriani. \r\n\r\nDar\u00edo has always worked in agriculture. On his five hectares of land he grows coffee, bananas, yucca, and pituca. He also has another two hectares which are lying fallow. His three children help him with the work: planting, tending, watering, and harvesting the crops. \u201cGrowing coffee has always provided me with a good income despite having to harvest twice a year,\u201d says Dar\u00edo when talking about the profitability of his work, \u201cbut it\u2019s worth the trouble.\u201d He says overcoming financial issues has been his biggest problem as on occasion he hasn\u2019t been able to afford to buy coffee plants and fertilizer. \r\n\r\n As well as his fields, Dar\u00edo has a small store in his home where he sells various products. It urgently needs more stock. \r\n\r\nWith the income from his harvests, this hardworking father will be able to buy furnishings for his store and more items to sell which, in turn, will bring in more customers.

Her children and her husband help her with the farming business.  Since 2004, Symbat has been involved in agriculture, having started with a capital of 7,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to her perseverance, Symbat has been quite successful; she now has 3.01 hectares of land on which she grows beans, potatoes and clover.  The family also provides plowing services with their tractor.

She studied until 7th grade and stopped in 1993 because she moved to South Africa to live with her sister. Julieta lived in South Africa until 2005, and there she worked with commerce, selling products and food in the street. Julieta met her boyfriend and moved in with him a few months later. Julieta decided to come back to Mozambique because according to her \u201clife in Mozambique is prettier and nicer\u201d. She has a small stand in the street where she sells food, such as tomatoes, rice, peanut, onions and garlic. Julieta makes between MTn 500 to MTn 1,000 per day. Julieta\u2019s best business is the wholesale products of things she brings from South Africa. Julieta goes to South Africa at least once a month and brings many products that clients request and others that she knows she will easily sell, such as crackers. Julieta has to accumulate at least 3,000 Rands to make sure she can buy enough products, pay the transport and also the customs duties. Every 3 months Julieta benefits from her business in South Africa and goes visit her boyfriend who still lives there.\r\n<p>\r\nTogether with her boyfriend (a Mozambican man from Maputo), Julieta bought land in Matola and started to build a house. The first MTn 8,000 loan with Hluvuku was used to pay half of the salary of the construction workers. They were asking MTn 16,000 and Julieta just had half of the money, and preferred to use a known institution than any man in the street. With this second loan of MTn 10,500 Julieta plans to continue building her house. She will buy windows, doors and 10 aluminum-roofing plaques to finish the bedrooms and the living room.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the future, Julieta would like to get married (officially), finish her house with a bathroom and build a fence around her house.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is 40, married, and the father of 2 children who are 12 and 6.  Both of them go to school.  He has a bachelor's degree in agricultural engineering, which he received in Holland.  He lives in his own home with his family, and he supports his 2 brothers and their children by sending them some money.  He left Inharrime for Maputo in 1988 to continue his studies.  After he finished studying at the Agrarian Institute in Boane, he traveled to Holland where he got his bachelor's degree.  He has worked as an agricultural technician for 17 years.  He works from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and makes a monthly wage of 12,530 meticais.  He saves some of it in his bank account.  He has never had a loan with another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through his friend who is also a client of the institution.  This is his 5th loan, and it is for 26,000 meticais.  He will use it to purchase construction materials (cement, iron, and to pay for labor) to continue building his home.  His previous loans were for 16,000, 15,000, 25,000, and 40,000 meticais.  All of them were used for the same purpose.  His goal is to finish his home so he can offer better living conditions to his family.  In the future he hopes to request more loans to build a commercial establishment and to start a small farm.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

It was founded in 2003, inspired by the solidarity and affinity that exists between the women.  After the group had existed for seven years and the women had gained experience in group organization, they approached the micro-finance institution, CAURIE-MF, to make use of their financial services.   Thus, on April 29, 2010, they became a Banc Villageois with the same name as their group and the village. They received their first loan on May 17, 2010 when they were inaugurated.\r\n\r\nThree quarters of the members are married and have at least two children; the average age of the women is 40. \r\n\r\nThe President of the Banc Villageois, Madame Awa N., is 47 and has four children. She farms livestock and plans to use her loan to buy four goats, which she will raise for at least four months before selling them in the large weekly market in her village.  She has been doing this for three years. In order to reduce feeding costs, she collects hay at the end of the rainy season and dries it so that it keeps better. Her goal is to help improve her family's standard of living by contributing to the cost of food, health care and clothing for her children. Her earnings also allow her to satisfy her own personal needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a single mom, and has a 14-year-old son.  She lives with her father in Viloma, a canton of the Sipe Sipe municipality, province of Quillacolla, 20 km. from Cochabamba.\r\n\r\nFor the past fifteen years, she has worked in dairy, since her mother died.  She also sees to her father\u2019s well-being, as he is elderly and can no longer work.  That\u2019s why she takes care of him, for she is the youngest sibling, and the only woman in the family.  Maria is a hard-working woman who gets up very early to milk the cows and deliver milk to the station in the area.  She also farms, growing onions and carrots in certain seasons.\r\n\r\nShe is devoted to her work but does not neglect her son\u2019s upbringing, and consistently supports him in his schooling.  Her dream is for her son to enroll in the university to complete his studies.  She wants him to study medicine and thus be able to help the people in the community where they live.  It is an isolated area whose inhabitants struggle to make a living.\r\n\r\nShe is asking for a loan to purchase cattle and thus increase milk production and deliver more to the station.  This will enable her to increase her earnings and provide a better future for her son and make her father more comfortable in his old age.  He always worked for her brothers and for her, and that is why she strives to be better each day.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Jane Wilkie, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":607128,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Compra de una cabeza de ganado lechero","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Cochabamba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.383333 -66.15","type":"point"}},"partner_id":140,"posted_date":"2010-09-26T01:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188657927},{"amount":301.34,"local_amount":301.34,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:42:07Z","rounded_local_amount":301.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201262148},{"amount":298.66,"local_amount":298.66,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:46:00Z","rounded_local_amount":298.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216479303},{"amount":300,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-29T07:46:24Z","rounded_local_amount":300,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232770071}],"funded_date":"2010-09-26T12:53:21Z","paid_date":"2011-10-29T07:46:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Jane Wilkie","image":null}},{"id":238509,"name":"Harrison","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Harrison is married and has two children whom he supports.

She runs a small store selling candies and sweets. The store is located on the first floor of a big apartment building which provides easy access for her clientele. She has been in this business for 6 years. \r\n\r\nRuzijon is very cheery and optimistic. Her store faces high competition as there are many supermarkets in the neighborhood. However, her customer-friendly service and the individual attention she can give help her keep loyal customers. Her responsibility and perseverance have helped Ruzijon repay all loans she has received from IMON International successfully. \r\n\r\nRuzijon is requesting a loan of $1500 US for a couple of purposes. She is going to do some remodeling work inside her vending facility and she\u2019d like to increase the assortment of products she has available. This loan will help Ruzijon expand her business, having a positive impact on her trade profitability, and helping to further improve the economic and social situation of her family.  \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Collision and Auto Repair\", as a family affair. The staff is comprised of Israel, his father and his brother. With a true entrepreneurial spirit, he states that the reason for starting his business was, simply, that \u201cnobody was hiring.\u201d With combined 40 years of experience, Israel and his family were able to take the grim reality of the economic downturn and turn it into a business opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe road to a successful business, Israel says, hasn\u2019t been an easy one. When he opened his business, which offers a wide range of automobile services from mechanical repairs to body work, it was located in a small shop in a residential neighborhood that wasn\u2019t a prime location for a body shop. The most successful business choice C. Auto Repair has made since it opened was moving from its original shop in Rueda, Texas, to a larger shop in Dallas. Of this choice, Israel says, \u201cWe took a leap of faith and moved to Dallas, and we just started growing based on referrals alone.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile he is happy about the business\u2019 success in its new location, Israel is constantly driving to grow and expand the services he offers. \u201cIn the future, I would really like to offer full-service everything \u2013 state inspections and alignments in a year or two, and, eventually, one or two other locations,\u201d he says. Getting to this future goal involves tireless work from Israel and his family \u2013 the shop is open for business 7 days a week, and Israel is typically there from open to close.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, C. Auto Repair was able to attain the operating capital needed to begin working in its new location. A large portion of the loan was used to install the plumbing systems necessary to get certified by the state. The remainder allowed Israel to buy an inspection machine, which will be used to further him toward his goal of turning C. Auto into a full-service shop.\r\n\r\nIsrael\u2019s business ethic is rooted in a dedication to good customer service. The advice that he gives to aspiring business owners is that \u201cthe biggest thing is return customers; always take care of your customers, and in return they will take care of you.\u201d This loan has allowed Israel to continue doing work he loves, expand his family business and continue to reliably serve the automobile needs of his Dallas community.

raised four children.  In search of an income source for his family, he started his own business of selling products and goods of daily demand in 2009.  Chiybyl's store is famous for the good quality of products.  He sells products at low prices, which is important to people with small incomes.

He went to school through third grade.  He is married and the father of five children, ages two to nine years old.  Only the eldest goes to school.  In pursuit of work, Arlindo left his family in Gaza and moved to Namaacha, a village on the border with Swaziland.  <P>\r\n\r\nArlindo had to interrupt his studies after finishing third grade because of the meager financial situation of his parents, who were poor country folk.  As such, he had to start working as a cook in people\u2019s houses.  Years later he was contracted by some customs employees who worked at the border in Namaacha, where he moved to take the job.  He received 1,850 meticais (MTn) per month while working as a cook.  Years later his employers were transferred, and he found employment at a five-star hotel in the village (Hotel Libombos), where he has worked until now.  He works 7am to 3pm on the morning shift and 3pm to 10pm on the afternoon shift, earning a monthly salary of 1,800MTn.  But because this salary was not enough to cover all his necessities, he decided to open his own business.  He acquired a stall at the central market in the village, where he sells clothes he purchases in Swaziland.  His best-selling items are nightgowns, shorts, and shirts, which he buys for 55MTn, 120MTn, and 220MTn and sells for 180MTn, 250MTn, and 450MTn respectively.  He makes a monthly profit of 4,000MTn.  He is able to save 1,500MTn, sends 3,500MTn to his family, and spends 800MTn. In addition to supporting his family, he takes care of three nephews, who live with his wife in Gaza because they lost their father.  <P>\r\n\r\nThis is Arlindo\u2019s second loan with Hluvuku [Kiva\u2019s Field Partner] and his first with Kiva.  He used his first loan of 9,200MTn to buy merchandise and requests this second loan of 15,000MTn for the same end.  He is confident that he will repay before the due date and will ask for another loan to complete his work in Gaza.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva

He lives with his brother and shares activities with him. Together they looked for opportunities outside of their birthplace. As of this date, they have obtained their own home, which took quite a bit of effort. Since Angel has finished his secondary studies, he has been interested in having his own business. Economic conditions had not allowed him to begin this business. To achieve his goals, he had to work at different sales jobs in the crowded markets of the city. After several years he obtained the capital that he needed and with his brother they purchased a booth where they sell clothes in the most popular market in the city. The large crowds in this market help their business. Never the less, the customers are very particular. The brothers have to provide a variety of clothing They also must provide the latest styles for men and women. It is in this manner that they work from eight in the morning until eleven at night.

Jessie is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which will be used to repair an existing vehicle for better service. This will be his first loan from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

From her childhood she has farmed, as it was her main source of income. The products that she cultivates the most are potatoes and corn. After about 6 months there is a harvest, for which she requires the help of labourers to facilitate the extraction of these products. She is very happy doing this work because she considers herself to be a capable and independent person. She wants to expand her land in order to cultivate more crops and increase production. This is her first loan with MFP. She is very happy to know that she has financial support. She is grateful to be part of her community bank because all of her peers are responsible and supportive. She thanks those who will lend money toward this loan. It will be very useful in the progress of her activities.

She is 19 years old and married. To make a living, Cherrie Mae owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop.

Cherrie Mae is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like biscuits and instant noodles. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Cherrie Mae from HSPFI.

Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She also supplies fresh fruit to hotels for additional income. She is married and has three children, ages 18, 16, 10 years old. All attend school; the elder two in high schools and the last in primary school. She lives in Malindi town of the Coastal Province, Kenya. \r\n\r\nJosephine joined Milango in April, 2011, after an invitation from a friend. Her major challenge comes from her supply business where payments are made on a monthly basis. A loan of 60,000 Kenyan shillings will help Josephine restock her business with retail stock like soap, sugar, flour, oil, etc. Josephine intends to faithfully repay her upcoming loan, so she can obtain higher credit and establish a salon and a boutique. This loan will also help her obtain additional income to carry out farming on the piece of land she bought using her first loan. She hopes Milango partners, especially KIVA, will support her with credit for her upcoming businesses.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":891336,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

She feels very good being a part of her community bank because it allows her to have savings.  The money she is now asking for is to buy utensils for her restaurant.  She will also buy new tablecloths and ingredients (rice and condiments) in large quantities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":384650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy utensils and ingredients for her food","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-07T17:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Brigida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:30:45Z","rounded_local_amount":205.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081310},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:03:07Z","rounded_local_amount":205.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997465},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:46Z","rounded_local_amount":205.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842810},{"amount":280,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-16T10:47:04Z","rounded_local_amount":823.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734387},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:12Z","rounded_local_amount":205.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717243},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:17Z","rounded_local_amount":205.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751020},{"amount":70,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":205.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933658}],"funded_date":"2009-09-07T22:27:20Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":139403,"name":"Hard Working Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"These are members of the Hard Working group.

She says selling these products is very lucrative and she has been in business for twenty years now. With her rich experience in selling, she is very popular in the areas where she trades her goods. She takes delivery of stock from the farming communities and this prevents her from using intermediaries who sell to her at higher prices.

They consistently put forth huge efforts in order to lead a decent life.  Some of them are the only providers for their families.  Kumushay A. is the leader of the group.  She is a mother of three children: two sons and one daughter.  All of the children attend universities, and the huge burden for paying their education contracts lies on the shoulders of Kumushay and her husband.  In order to provide the children with education, Kumushay took out a loan in the sum of five thousand som ($100) in 2001 and started selling various goods (seeds, chewing gum, candy, etc.) at a store that she opened together with her husband near their home.  She was fortunate to have the store near a school.  The sales were very good, and soon Kumushay and her husband were able to increase the goods turnover to twenty thousand som ($450).  Their current net monthly profit from the sales is from five to six thousand som.  Her husband and daughter primarily work at the store now.  Kumushay found a salesperson job at a pharmacy opposite a hospital and receives a salary in the sum of four thousand som ($90).  She needed means to increase goods turnover and merchandise variety at their store.  This is why she requested this loan.\r\n\r\nHer group partners are:\r\n\r\nElmira B. is forty-five years old.

His wife is a homemaker, and this is why he is mainly responsible for supporting the family.  Rahatbek is involved in agriculture.  He buys livestock, fattens it and resells it.

By the grace of God, Roselyn has managed to support her children's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send all of her children all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Roselyn as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nRoselyn operates a buy and sell business. What she basically does is buy general merchandise from wholesalers and sell them piecemeal with a little profit. Products can range from furniture to household appliances, electronic devices, clothing and other such products. Customers are attracted to buy due to the low selling prices and the many options offered. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 14,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy greater quantity and more variety of products to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n  \r\nRoselyn dreams of being able to give all her children a good, high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her house renovated by the end of the year. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":617965,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more products to expand her inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T09:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roselyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":933.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":933.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":21.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":130,"local_amount":5599.98,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5645.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380506},{"amount":195,"local_amount":8400.02,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:50Z","rounded_local_amount":8468.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816840}],"funded_date":"2010-10-15T14:16:50Z","paid_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":242642,"name":"Jessica Tatiana","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"En la ciudadela Cevallos de la ciudad de Portoviejo se re\u00fane cada quince d\u00edas el Banco Comunal Damas De \u00c9xito, esta es una zona urbano marginal muy poblada en esta ciudad.\n\nAqu\u00ed encontramos a la se\u00f1ora Jessica, ella tiene 32 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y tiene una hija de 5 a\u00f1os de edad la cual est\u00e1 en el primer a\u00f1o de educaci\u00f3n b\u00e1sica, su marido realiza transporte escolar en su carro.\n\nSe dedica al comercio, arrienda un local en el centro de la ciudad de Portoviejo donde vende zapatos de ni\u00f1as, nos cuenta que ya son tres a\u00f1os que lleva en este negocio y que gracias  a Dios le ha ido bien, trabaja todos los d\u00edas desde las 8am hasta las 18h00, cuenta con la ayuda de una ayudante a la cual ella le paga un sueldo.

They are all involved in clothing retail and support each other in repaying the loan.\r\n\r\nGulnarkan K., 50, is a leader of this group. She\u2019s a resident of one of the five largest towns in the Jalalabad province. She lives with her husband, who is a private entrepreneur as a city cab driver, and with a 16-year-old daughter, who goes to high school. \r\n\r\nGulnarkan has always been characterized by her friends and relatives as a person with a fighting spirit and a big desire to move forward. She says these precise features helped her to start up a women\u2019s apparel retail business. Being a business-lady, she truly realizes the importance of the environment in business. She always hopes to have political and economic stability in Kyrgyzstan. This knowledge is due to her original profession in economics. Many years ago she used to work as an economist in a plant, but soon it stopped functioning and forced her to go into the business sphere. \r\n\r\nSix years ago, Gulnarakan spent 300,000 soms form the family budget to build a shop. She attaches high importance to how the shop looks and has decorated it carefully. Now she gains the fruits of her labor by 15,000 soms of monthly income. \r\n\r\nGulnarkan applied for this loan with the belief that it\u2019ll help her to increase her stock. The generated revenue will be spent on construction of a house. \r\n\r\n<b>Where Did This Loan Come From? <\/b>\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple \"P\" bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

A., age 27, is a young kerosene merchant in the village of Aklakou, where he lives with his family of five people. The place where he sells kerosene for lamps is out in the open, under the hot sun. He is often obliged to buy on credit and repay after he sells the kerosene. That system does not permit him to make enough profit to support his family and improve his business premises. The need to build a shed to sell out of and to pay upfront for the kerosene leads him to ask for a loan of US$ 1200. Finding financing for these improvements in his business will allow him to flourish and to better provide for his family. <P> <B>Translated from the French by Teresa Kramer, KIVA volunteer <P><\/B>Age de 27 ans, M.
