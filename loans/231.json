Cruz's business is a corner store, a business she has had since she was very young. According to her, she started her business when she observed that her husband's income was insufficient, and she tells us that it was very difficult at first because she had no idea how to start.  In a time in her life she was a pork butcher, which gave her an idea on what she was going to do, but butchering pork was only a once-a-week occurence, and she felt that the earnings were too small. Today her greatest need is to invest in her business through the pruchase of products for resale.  For this reason Cruz has been working with CEPRODEL for 4 years now and she feels very satisfied with the credit that has been granted to her.  She has secured higher income that has benefitted the improvement of her business and of her household.

In the business environment that they work in there is a lot of competition., especially in this time of financial crisis.  In order to persevere, they must avoid the obstacles and work hard to retain the income of their businesses, which is the main source of income that supports their families.  The loan will be used to purchase ingredients and materials so that the members will be able to increase their income and improve their quality of life.  Despite the fact that this is the first time that the group receives financing the majority of the members have already participated in similar groups and they were able to prove that they are responsible and trustworthy with repaying loans.\r\n<p>\r\n(Translated by Thatcher of San Roque High School)<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kendra Gaete, Kiva

Her son attends secondary school and her mother is retired. Chimgee operates and manages a traditional shoe making business with her father. She makes two different types of traditional shoes, one called Buriad and the other is called Mongol. She started her business in 2006 and at that time only produced the Buriad shoes. As she began gaining more experience and customers, she expanded her product line to include the Mongol shoes. Through her hard work, she has been able to buy tools and rent a small work area. One day, she would like to own her own store where she can sell her products, expand her product line and also attract new customers. She is requesting a 1,000,000 tugrug (~700 USD) loan to purchase more supplies and tools for her shoe making

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<em>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<\/em><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Tausala's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nSPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nTausala's Overall Social Metric Score*:                1 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

She is 68 years old. Rosalia is the group leader of a 2-member group taking out a loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRosalia is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Rosalia raises livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Rosalia has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Rosalia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Rosalia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. Rosalia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which she will use to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 18th loan taken out by Rosalia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

She earns her living by operating food vending, BBQ and bakery businesses. Macaria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Macaria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 18,000, uplifting her family's standard of living. This time, for her eighth cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her current businesses as well as enough capital to a open a new business so she can continue to save up for her family's future security. Macaria A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable').

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

","en":"Tania is 32 years old, single and lives with her parents and brothers. Since she was a little girl she worked at different activities helping her parents. Among these activities she learned how to sell beer wholesale, and has been in this business for the last ten years. She feels very content with this business, since she has liked the trade business since she was little. Thanks to the lucrative aspect of this business, particularly thanks to the many community events that take place in her town, she can sell large quantities of beer at very good profit. In time she hopes to become a great distributor, or at least be well known in her circle. Tania is currently on her second loan with MFP, and she expects to continue to work as she has been, with great sense of responsibility and a good repayment record. With the money that she is requesting, she will buy more boxes of beer with which she hopes to increase her sales during the holidays.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Monica Hayden, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":251473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Incremento de la cantidad de bebidas que vende","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-08T16:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":251.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228323},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":251.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423555},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:37:09Z","rounded_local_amount":251.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116818},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:47:03Z","rounded_local_amount":251.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011748},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:51Z","rounded_local_amount":251.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595343},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:41:40Z","rounded_local_amount":251.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989574},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:43:12Z","rounded_local_amount":251.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210754},{"amount":81.25,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:03Z","rounded_local_amount":251.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640384}],"funded_date":"2009-01-11T18:21:23Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:23:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Monica Hayden","image":170539}},{"id":86520,"name":"Ignacia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ignacia L. and her family are living a simple life in the village of San Manuel Naguillan, Isaebla.

Irma is twenty-five years old and is a single mother.  She works hard for the sake of her young daughter.  \r\n\r\nIrma has been working with Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for about five years and is a member of the communal bank \"Nuevas Amigas\" (New Friends).  Irma invested her first loan of 300 soles (about $100) in the business of selling beauty products.  This business partially financed her university studies. She plans to use this loan of 2500 soles to purchase undergarments and basic grocery products to sell in Masisea, where she works. Irma spends most of her time in Masisea but returns to Pucallpa at the end of every month to collect her teacher's salary.  \r\n\r\nIrma's goal is to design undergarments and to have her own boutique from which to sell them.  She is pleased to be working with Manuela Ramos because the organization gives loans without much bureaucracy and paperwork, unlike most other banks.

Ikhtiyor is a family man who wishes to increase his business to be able to better support his family and offer them a better quality of life. Eight years ago, Ikhtiyor started by selling blankets and counterpanes (bedspreads).  His business has grown little by little and now offers greater variety and fashions. Today, Ikhtiyor has been working with Kiva partner IMON International for more than three years and feels very satisfied with the support offered to him because it has allowed him to increase his business, satisfy the needs of his customers and support his family. Ikhtiyor is asking to borrow $1,500 USD in order to purchase new goods. He wants to develop his business and increase his income to save money and create a better life for his family. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives together with her husband in sector Angolo II, M\u00f3rrope district, located one hour from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Laura has worked raising animals for 14 years. She tells us that this is one of the most common activities of the zone, and is a great help in meeting the household costs, owing to the fact that the majority of men work in agriculture and this doesn't offer sufficient earnings.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Laura is conscious that she must continue to move forward and support her husband in maintaining their home. Because of this, one year ago she also installed a small grocery store in her home. These businesses are a great help to the family's economy.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Laura wants to expand her business by purchasing more animals, but doesn't have sufficient capital to realise this action. For this reason for the first time she saw a need to ask Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 2000 nuveos soles, which will permit her to achieve her objective.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Laura is a responsible woman, active and very hard-working.

He has owned his land for over 25 years, but he has lived in the rural area his whole life. Although he has a limited education, he has been able to be successful farming. He is seeking the loan in order to invest in rice now that the rainy season is making the land apt for cultivation. He has five children that he has been able to educate. Two of his children are making their way through college and Tirso wants to keep supporting them. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tirso is part of the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming, plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural area in the Province of Guayas which is known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to rice farming and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year during the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous area despite its rural location. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in the fact that many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention force.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding during the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worst when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, rice farmers lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":15496,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Cultivate rice on his land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.166667 -79.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-02-20T04:59:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tirso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-09T00:07:30Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-04-25T14:52:28Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13835},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-02T18:37:14Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":19607},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-27T13:52:55Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26597},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-27T15:56:05Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36147},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-28T23:25:19Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47470},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-09-27T16:14:47Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-28T19:09:08Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59562}],"funded_date":"2007-02-23T00:07:30Z","paid_date":"2007-09-27T16:14:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":8688,"name":"Khuraman","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Khuraman is local of the town of Beylagan.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She runs a small fabric selling business where she offers to the market, a variety types of fabrics for different tastes and ages. She is asking for this loan so that she can buy a larger quantity of goods. The extra capital will enable her to expand her merchandise and thereby improve her business and increase her profits. Her dreams are to have her own large store one day, but most importantly, enable her children to have a better future, one where they can continue to study at the university, become professionals, and lead healthy and comfortable lives. On behalf of Khosiyat and everyone here at IMON International, thank you for your support!\r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

This includes two sisters - Mrs. Maria Delcy and Mrs. Dica Patricia - but they are both married and each of their incomes is independent from the other's. The group's members run a variety of businesses, driving taxis or selling products like clothing, meals, cosmetics, crafts, and sauces.There is a high demand for these products but there is also a large number of people selling them, so customers are naturally inclined to purchase only those products that are of the best quality and that are being sold at the lowest price. This is why the group's members are requesting this loan, so that they have the working capital needed to offer the best products at the lowest price and thus, increase their incomes and their families' quality of life. Some of the group's members have a lot of experience with communal banking and for others this is their first loan, but they feel capable, as a group and as clients of the Agrocapital Foundation, of making their payments punctually and taking advantage of the great opportunities this loan will bring. \r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":275793,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-03-03T04:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pedro Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guicela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dica Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenny Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Delcy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aleida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1800.78},{"due_date":"2009-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1821.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1842.46},{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1863.66},{"due_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1885.1},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1906.8},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1928.74},{"due_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1950.96}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":258.11},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":261.08},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":264.09},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":267.12},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.2},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":273.31},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":276.45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":783.28,"local_amount":5464.74,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:21:59Z","rounded_local_amount":5498.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091177},{"amount":267.12,"local_amount":1863.66,"processed_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1875.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091178},{"amount":270.19,"local_amount":1885.1,"processed_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1896.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35984498},{"amount":273.3,"local_amount":1906.8,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:24:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1918.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35984499},{"amount":276.45,"local_amount":1928.74,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:35:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1940.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35984500},{"amount":279.66,"local_amount":1950.96,"processed_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:01:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1963.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445073}],"funded_date":"2009-03-05T18:36:57Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T23:01:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara Sultan","image":null}},{"id":94728,"name":"Sokheng","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sokheng C., 46, and her husband Mr. Sokhan Sao, 49, were married in 1992.

She lives with her daughter in a house she owns. She's been selling food at a local school for three years. Every morning she cooks at home and takes the meals to the school near her house. Her food is for the teachers and students, and she stays at the school until 3 in the afternoon, sometimes until 5. Esther is able to earn enough this way to cover her family's living expenses. She also enjoys her work because she likes to cook. She still helps support her daughter, who is studying in the university. Esther dreams of opening a restaurant and working there during the day.

Tuichiboy is a father who has devoted himself to independent agriculture tasks for the past six years, cultivating corn, potatoes and onions. His daily efforts and the care of his fields assure him a good harvest as well as profits, so that his 4 children can continue their education.\r\n\r\nTuichiboy has dreamed of extending his lands and wants to obtain a loan to invest in his current land by purchasing seeds and fertilizer to earn greater profits and reach the goal he has set for himself. He thanks everyone supporting him and promises to repay the loan with no violations.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Its members are very compatible,  and responsible with their payments. We talked with several of the members -one of whom is Mrs. Nora.  She has been married for 17 years and has 3 children.  Her husband is a teacher and they have a good familial relationship.\r\n\r\nOur member sells beauty products  but not in a store.  The brands that she sells are Yanbal and Esika.  She has only recently started handling Esika and she is seeing how this cosmetic line works out. She has been in this business for eight years and she does it to help with the financial support of her family and also because she likes sales.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she has received from the foundation she has been able to grow her capital.  With this new loan she will buy perfumes, makeup, creams and costume jewelry. She has to pay for the products every 15 days and that is why she decided to purchase the merchandise with cash.

The city is surrounded by mountains, the outstanding feature of an already-beautiful countryside.  The climate is cold. The local people are friendly and committed to preserving their culture and traditions.  Most earn their livings from commerce, raising animals and farming.  Some work in the city and live in the country.\r\n\r\nOur member, Dona Maria, 53, is married and has 8 children, three of whom are married and living away.  Four others work and help Maria with household expenses and the youngest is still in school.  Her husband is a construction worker.

Es por esto que Juan anteriormente ten\u00eda una venta de ropa la cual ofrec\u00eda a una gran cantidad de clientes, y gracias a la buena calidad de estos productos, Juan pudo tener muy buenos niveles de ventas. Debido a circunstancias ajenas a su voluntad, Juan se vio en la obligaci\u00f3n de cerrar su negocio de venta de ropa y dedicarse a su empleo como auxiliar de equipaje. Con el \u00e1nimo de reiniciar su negocio de venta de ropa, Juan aspira a que un pr\u00e9stamo le brinde la oportunidad de acceder a la compra de ropa al por mayor para reiniciar su negocio de venta de ropa. \nJuan espera que con este negocio, alterno a su empleo, pueda generar mayores ingresos para su familia, de modo que pueda ofrecerles una mejor calidad de vida y una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica. Juan espera poder conseguir esta mercanc\u00eda sin que sus ingresos mensuales se vean afectados, y de esta manera seguir ofreciendo el sustento de su hogar. Juan sue\u00f1a con tener un gran negocio, el cual pueda ofrecer empleo para las personas m\u00e1s necesitadas y desde el cual sus hijos puedan tener una estabilidad econ\u00f3mica para progresar en un futuro. \n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1010730,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Compra de ropa al por mayor para reiniciar su negocio de venta de ropa.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"El Carmen de Viboral","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan Fernando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":74246},{"due_date":"2012-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":76342},{"due_date":"2012-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":78497},{"due_date":"2012-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":80712},{"due_date":"2012-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":82991},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":85333},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":87742},{"due_date":"2012-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":90219},{"due_date":"2012-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":92765},{"due_date":"2012-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":95384},{"due_date":"2013-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":98076},{"due_date":"2013-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":100844},{"due_date":"2013-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":103691},{"due_date":"2013-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":106618},{"due_date":"2013-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":109627},{"due_date":"2013-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":112722},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":115904},{"due_date":"2013-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":119175},{"due_date":"2013-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":122539},{"due_date":"2013-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":125998},{"due_date":"2013-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":129555},{"due_date":"2013-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":133212},{"due_date":"2014-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":136972},{"due_date":"2014-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":140836}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.32},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.52},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.74},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.31},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.64},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.01},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.43},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.87},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.9},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.49},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.1},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.77},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.49},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.25},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.07},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.93},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.82},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.85},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.93},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.07},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":883156,"name":"Vincent","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vincent is 35 years old.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling seafood to the local community. Cresilda has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 4,000.00 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Cresilda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cresilda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000.00 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Cresilda is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP, which will be used to repair their residential house. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Cresilda from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Tan-awan, Oslob, Cebu. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: fish vending and pig fattening. Her husband, Misael R., who is 37 years old, works as a driver to earn his living.  They have three children who are 6 to 14 years old. Marilou joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marilou has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to purchase more fish to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her family. Marilou R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  Photo was taken at the center because her business was sold out early in the morning. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nGloria is married and has 6 adult-aged children. To make a living, Gloria owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Gloria has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Gloria joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Gloria has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. Gloria is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase young livestock to raise & sell in the future. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Gloria from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Renilda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Renilda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000 so that she will have enough revolving capital to buy more ingredients and be able to offer a wider variety of food in her carinderia (small restaurant) and she also intends to use part of the loan to sustain her fishing activities.

Currently, she has two cows.  She planted fodder (grass) on 1 hectare and gathered it for the livestock.  Mamlakat is requesting a loan in the sum of 5500 somoni to buy cattle because she has extra fodder and can keep a larger quantity of livestock.

Han sido contactados por un supermercado grande de la zona para que les pueda proveer de los pollos de forma constante, y est\u00e1n en tratativas con la  empresa para firmar  contrato, de esta forma proveer de pollos durante un a\u00f1o inicialmente.\r\n\r\nPor este motivo, solicitan el cr\u00e9dito de $ 500 que los invertir\u00e1 en la compra de aves para el engorde y as\u00ed empezar a proveer al supermercado que los contrato."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":57111,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Quyet has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock.

All of them are getting an education, except the eldest one, who didn\u2019t have any interest in education. That is why he helps his father in his dairy business. \r\n\r\nSakina has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah, for her husband\u2019s business. With the loan, her husband will buy another buffalo to increase the milk-productivity of his business. Currently, he has a buffalo at his home and it gives him around 8kg milk. He sells 1kg milk for 45 PKRs, which has become a standard amount in every city. He gets almost 360 PKRs every day. By adding another buffalo his income will double and he will be able to sell milk to more customers.\r\n \r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and is in her 3rd loan cycle.

She is a hard working young woman and she is endeavoring to come out ahead. Her day starts very early as a cashier in a shopping centre, working from 9 in the morning until 9 at night, 6 days a week. She only gets a 1 hour break all day.  She needs to travel a long way to get to her work but she keeps it up because she has many plans in mind.  Although she doesn't have much spare time she plans on continuing on with her clothing business. She has some clients who buy from her on credit.  She purchases her clothing in wholesale from a large outlet in the city. She says that both of her jobs generate considerable income for her which allows her to support herself. In the future she wants to set up her own business but she doesn't really know in what field exactly she wants to specialize.  This is the first loan she accesses from MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she is compromised to the terms of this loan.

She is 46 years old. Anselma is married and has 2 adult-aged children. To make a living, Anselma owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as canned goods, junk food, spices and vegetables in the local community. Anselma has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 8000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Anselma joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anselma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Anselma is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like canned goods & snacks. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Anselma from HSPFI.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With a lot of effort, he has managed to get ahead.  \n\nEnrique knows the best way to raise pigs, and as such understands that they like to be in a cool environment near mud or water. It is also best to have them tied up or they can get uncomfortable. He claims that, thanks to God, his business has been very profitable.  His only problem has been the illnesses that he has faced.  Currently, his biggest dream is to own his own pig farm."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":803284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Before joining One Acre Fund, Robert was only able to get 4 bags on 1\/2 acre of land.  \n\nWith the profits from his harvest, Robert plans on sending his children to school, repairing his home, saving for the future, investing in livestock, and perhaps investing in a business.  \n\nIn total, Robert's group will plant 6 acres of land in 2012, each farmer planting between 1\/2 and 1 acre.\n\nRobert's  Field Officer Josephine is in front of this picture.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":863992,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-09-20T04:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benedict ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Emmanuel ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Loise ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margaret ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robert ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":53200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":53200,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-22T09:57:26Z","rounded_local_amount":53992.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680387}],"funded_date":"2011-09-21T13:36:49Z","paid_date":"2012-11-22T09:57:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":337374,"name":"Juan Antonio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juan, vive con su madre, es soltero, administra una granja de pollos, este negocio lo inicio hace varios a\u00f1os su madre, cr\u00edan los pollos y salen a ofrecerlos ya alineados, no tiene un horario fijo para hacer la venta.
