Lidia feels very capable and is happy to remain active. \r\n<p>\r\nAt the moment, Do\u00f1a Lidia hopes to expand her farm so she is requesting a microloan of 250,000 colones.  In order to maintain her latest crop of bananas, she will purchase fertilizers and other supplies.  Lidia expects a good harvest from this investment.  This crop usually commands a high selling price, so she wants to increase her production so that she can generate more income for her family.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Lidia is a member of the Women\u2019s Community Credit Enterprise of La Esperanza, which is composed solely of women.

He lives in his own home with his wife Teresa who is 56 years old and his 5  grown-up children who also live with their respective families.  Together they work hard every day to get ahead in life.  This enterprising man has worked as a public transport driver for the past 30 years.  He has also worked as a conductor and he says that he likes his work a lot because it has allowed him to get his children ahead in life and give them an education.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Nelson has worked for a number of different companies and he is currently in the process of renting and buying a vehicle so that he can become self employed.  What he doesn't like about being a driver is that many times he has to put up with his passengers' bad tempers since some of them are very overbearing.  However he is satisfied because he works only one shift from 8 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon and he makes regular profits.\r\n\r\nAs Nelson is a man who has many hopes for the future, he is planning to set up a grocery store in his home as he would like to continue making progress.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan which Nelson has had from MFP and he pledges to make his repayments in a timely manner because he doesn't want to let down the people who are providing this support which will allow him to continue with his plans to get ahead.

K. is a 36-year-old woman who is married to a pastor and is blessed with six children. She lives in Mlolongo town, situated along the Nairobi-Mombasa Highway. Peninah started selling secondhand clothes in 1996 in a town known as Rongai in Kajiado District, but then her husband moved to Mlolongo town so she also had to move. She then settled in Mlolongo town where she has been operating her business ever since. <p> Peninah started her business with an initial capital of Ksh 3,000 (USD 45), which was a loan from her husband. Fortunately, she was able to settle the loan in good time from the high sales she made from her business. Due to the growing population within this town, the demand for her clothes is at the peak during the cold-weather season, when people buy warm clothing. <p> Being a pastor\u2019s wife, Peninah also cares about the less fortunate members of her Gospel Tabernacle church, and she assists them in paying their  rent and also gives them the clothes that are left over after her sales. This act is of great significance to her.

When she became pregnant she had to leave her work, but with her small savings she was able to set up her little shop, and later, she took advantage of the opportunity to sell beauty products.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the first loan she received through the group called Mientras Tanto, Siempre Unidas (always united), she purchased milk and oil to stock her new business.  With this new loan, which she will repay in 4 months, she will buy fabric and other materials to create party dresses as  she has requests for an upcoming children's party.  She will also use some of the loan to purchase eggs, rice, oil, and other items she needs to stock up on. <\/p> \r\n\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Gloria de Los Milagros tiene 40 a\u00f1os de edad, estudi\u00d3 una carrera t\u00e9cnica y tiene 2 hijos que aun dependen de ella.

H. is a 40-year-old businessman. He is a husband and the father of 6 children who are currently in school. He is a retailer of beef in the local market. He buys his supplies from Techiman, which is about 50 km away, and sells to his customers. Beef is enjoyed by many Ghanaian homes because the flavour is good and it is quite affordable. With his small working capital, he is not able to buy larger quantities to make enough income.

In the year that he has been working in this enterprise he has been able to observe that the business provides good income, which has animated him to forge ahead and obtain more capital.  For Edwin, it has not been difficult to realize this work since over time he has become more skilled at selling his products.  This is the first loan he is requesting with Microfinanzas Prisma.  With the funds, he will buy more oil which will allow him to increase his sales. <p>  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":224381,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a greater quantity of oil to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-11T14:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":133},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":135}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.72},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":141.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957611},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":141.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227865},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":141.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423097},{"amount":45.72,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":141.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116340},{"amount":45.71,"local_amount":133,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":141.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011286},{"amount":46.41,"local_amount":135,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:05Z","rounded_local_amount":143.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594894}],"funded_date":"2008-11-11T18:20:18Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":78020,"name":"Oghogho","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oghogho O. is a 53-year-old widow with 3 children, who are all university students.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This community is noted for the fact that there are several PEMEX oil wells located there.  In this community there is a group called 'Barahunda'.  The group chose this name because it is the name of their community and also because the word means 'fiesta', 'bustle' or 'noise\" which describes this very cheerful and united group.\r\n\r\nElia Moran is one of the group's members.  She is 60 years old and has six children who are all married.  She currently lives with two of her grandchildren.  She tells us that more than 7 years ago she wanted to work and, with the support of her children, she opened a furniture store in her community called \"Muebleria Diana\" (Diana's Furniture Store) in honor of her youngest granddaughter.  Elia also raises pigs.  She has a small farmyard behind her home where she keeps her pigs.  Elia needs this loan to invest in buying feed for her pigs and some household products (chests of drawers, blenders, mixers and irons) to re-stock her business.\r\n\r\nElia hopes that this loan will help her to make progress in her business and that her sales will increase since she would like to make good profits so that she can paint her business and continue investing in it.

Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.

Her clientele base is made up of women. She receives order from her neighbors.

Ulugbek is 38 years old. He is married with two children. He has a great passion for dairy farming and has been in this business for 6 years together with his wife. Ulugbek would like to expand his business by adding more cattle to the ones he has. This is because recently he acquired orders from outside town to supply milk. He is requesting a loan of 5900 Somoni. With additional income Ulugbek will be better able to cater for his family financial obligations, especially the education of his children.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

There are a lot of restaurants and rooms for rent to accommodate those university students. Apart from the need for food, living space and cultural exchange, getting on line is an undeniable necessity for the young crowd. Based on her market study, Ms Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Th\u00fay opened an internet cafe in 2003. Ms Th\u00fay is 57 years old, her 3 children are all grown up and have a job so she has to hire 2 employees to help her run the internet cafe. Having a good, friendly customer service keeps the cafe busy. Her husband, a retired military officer, helps her out when she is busy. The revenue for the internet cafe is about 350 USD \/ month minus salaries for the 2 employees at 50 USD \/ month. Ms Th\u00fay requests a loan of 575 USD to buy new equipment for her internet cafe.\r\n\r\n<P><B>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva volunteer<P><\/b>\r\n\r\nL\u00e0 m\u1ed9t \u0111\u1ecba b\u00e0n r\u1ea5t thu\u1eadn l\u1ee3i cho vi\u1ec7c ph\u00e1t tri\u1ec3n kinh t\u1ebf (g\u1ea7n tr\u01b0\u1eddng \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc s\u01b0 ph\u1ea1m H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i 2) n\u00ean tr\u00ean \u0111\u1ecba b\u00e0n ph\u01b0\u1eddng Xu\u00e2n H\u00f2a c\u00f3 r\u1ea5t nhi\u1ec1u nh\u1eefng c\u1eeda h\u00e0ng \u0103n, ph\u00f2ng tr\u1ecd.

El presto en Afodenic para comenzar hacer la construcci\u00f3n  de su casa pero como el financiamiento es poco por  la disponibilidad que el cuenta,  solo logro comprar parte de los materiales de construcci\u00f3n ya que todo esta caro. Es por eso que con este financiamiento comprara m\u00e1s material como: bloques,cemento,tablas, clavos y otros para comenzar hacer las mejoras, ya que es dif\u00edcil en los tiempos de invierno para el, ya que se pasa el agua. Da las gracias por el apoyo ya que solo es posible esta mejora con el financiamiento ya que no cuenta con capital propio.\n\n","en":"\r\n\r\nGerardo, 54, is an unassuming, hard-working man.  His wife has a daughter, who is studying bookkeeping.  Gerardo is a bookkeeper and works independently.  This means that he works for several companies but at a very low pay rate.  Because he works for several, however, it adds up to enough to pay for food and some household expenses.  \r\n\r\nHowever, it has been very difficult for him to do any home improvements and his house is very unsafe.  He got funding from Afodenic to start building his house but, because the loan was small due to his eligibility limits, he was only able to buy some of the materials because everything is very expensive.  \r\n\r\nWith this new loan he will buy more materials like: concrete blocks, cement, boards, nails, etc. to start the improvements because Winter is an especially difficult time for him because water gets into the interior of the house. \r\n\r\nHe gives thanks for the support because these improvements are only possible thanks to the loans because he does not have his own capital.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

I could be my own boss.\u201d \r\n \r\nNot long after that, Edwin and his wife, Maria, started a family-owned janitorial and handyman repair business. Thirty years later, the business is still going strong and now employs two additional workers to help manage a wide variety of jobs that range from installing tile in houses to gardening to cleaning office buildings.\r\n \r\nThe couple\u2019s favorite part of running a small business is the flexibility it affords them. They work hard, but have the freedom to create their own schedule and spend more time with family. \u201cAs my own boss there\u2019s nobody telling me what to do \u2013 but that also comes with responsibility. You have to be disciplined. You can\u2019t afford complaints from clients,\u201d said Edwin.\r\n \r\nDespite 30 years of experience and their strong work ethic, the recession has presented a significant challenge to the business: \u201cWhen the economy is bad, things are tough, because people don\u2019t have extra money to spend on fixing their houses.\u201d \r\n \r\nIn order to secure more work, Edwin and Maria needed capital, but many of the places they initially looked charged interest rates pushing 90%. Fortunately, their search also led them to Opportunity Fund, a local micro-lender, where they were approved for a $750 micro-loan (with an interest rate of 8%). With their loan, Edwin and Maria will be able to take on an extra account and build their credit for larger business loans in the future. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":764140,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to take on an extra janitorial account and build their credit history.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Richmond, CA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":132,"posted_date":"2011-05-06T01:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin And Maria","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":750,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":121.76},{"due_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123.92},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":124.87},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":125.61},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":126.47},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":127.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.76},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.92},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":124.87},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.61},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":126.47},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":127.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":121.76,"local_amount":121.76,"processed_date":"2011-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-29T07:57:27Z","rounded_local_amount":121.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211284829},{"amount":123.92,"local_amount":123.92,"processed_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-22T07:59:30Z","rounded_local_amount":123.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":217381941},{"amount":124.87,"local_amount":124.87,"processed_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:20:38Z","rounded_local_amount":124.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221734791},{"amount":125.61,"local_amount":125.61,"processed_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-27T08:20:54Z","rounded_local_amount":125.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227105071},{"amount":126.47,"local_amount":126.47,"processed_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-20T08:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":126.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232866404},{"amount":127.37,"local_amount":127.37,"processed_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":127.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238682476}],"funded_date":"2011-05-07T13:39:09Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T11:09:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":300157,"name":"Charles","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charles, a 27-year-old married father of four children, has been selling curios along Kijabe Street in Nairobi for five years.

This way of life makes it possible for her to generate resources to help out her family since she\u2019s married and has two children.\r\n\r\nWhen she is asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes the health clinic.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2250,"image":{"id":813052,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy fabric and thread.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2011-07-16T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angelica Maria\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hilda\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gerson Efriain","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Arminda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susset Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melissa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betshabe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":15656.55,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1565.7},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1565.7},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1565.7},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1565.7},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1565.7},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1565.7},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1565.7},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1565.7},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1565.7},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1565.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.01},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.01},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.01},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.01},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225.01},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225.01},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":224.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225.01,"local_amount":1565.7,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:27:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1566.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221746234},{"amount":675.02,"local_amount":4697.1,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:17:26Z","rounded_local_amount":4698.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227115859},{"amount":450.01,"local_amount":3131.4,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:10:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3132.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232877514},{"amount":450.01,"local_amount":3131.4,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:20:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3132.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238694221},{"amount":449.95,"local_amount":3130.95,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:08:14Z","rounded_local_amount":3131.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244650255}],"funded_date":"2011-07-17T13:18:46Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T11:08:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":320645,"name":"Filma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Filma is a 42-year-old woman who is married and lives in Clarin, Misamis Occidental, Philippines.

This is one of the most productive and popular activities in the city of Estel\u00ed, where she is from. She has two children, 18 and 14 years old respectively. They are studying, and are Maria's priority and she wants a better future for them.\r\n\r\nShe started her business selling 50 tortillas, a very small quantity, because she didn't have enough of the needed ingredients. Afterwards, her inventory increased because she gained additional clients. She also noticed that in small corner shops a lot of people were asking for tortillas, so she began selling her tortillas in these stores as well. This turned out to be a good strategy, and has become her second business. Before she worked sewing but she didn't make very much money. Selling tortillas is more profitable, so she decided to sell tortillas.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan to buy wholesale firewood and maiz (corn), since she gets a better result by buying wholesale so as to get a good price for the materials, and produce more. One of her plans for the future is to hire employees so that they can help her make tortillas and satisfy part of her clients' demand, since she alone can't fill all of her orders. Her next goal is to make repairs on her humble home, starting in the kitchen--where she makes her tortillas. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":943417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy firewood and corn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2011-12-14T02:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Dilia \t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":262.15,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":29.11},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":29.13},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":29.13},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":29.13},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":29.13},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":29.13},{"due_date":"2012-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":29.13},{"due_date":"2012-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":29.13},{"due_date":"2012-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":29.13}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.55},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.54,"local_amount":29.11,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":30.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257242703},{"amount":30.55,"local_amount":29.13,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:28Z","rounded_local_amount":30.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263381975},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":29.13,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":30.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270095505},{"amount":39.22,"local_amount":37.39,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:27:41Z","rounded_local_amount":39.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276710128},{"amount":21.9,"local_amount":20.87,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":21.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283403567},{"amount":35.97,"local_amount":34.29,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:47:17Z","rounded_local_amount":35.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287428516},{"amount":70.66,"local_amount":67.36,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T09:06:20Z","rounded_local_amount":70.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294613236},{"amount":15.6,"local_amount":14.87,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:53:35Z","rounded_local_amount":15.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452736}],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T14:46:46Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:53:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Betsy McCormick","image":781553}},{"id":373948,"name":"Mamie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mamie lives in Buchanan.

In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:<p>\r\n\r\n\u201cBackground: The Ndigne group is located in the village of Louly Ngogom.  Situated in the interior of the country, Louly is an agricultural village that specializes in peanut farming.\r\n<p>\r\nPurpose:  To support the families of the village in between harvests, and improve living conditions.\r\n<p>\r\nActivities:  The business consists of buying sheep, fattening them and selling them at the weekly markets.\u201d \r\n<p>\r\n\r\nBackground <p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.<p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b> Business description translated from French by Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance Fund. <\/b> \r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u00abContexte : Le groupement Ndigun\u00e9 est un groupement du village de Louly Ngokhom ; Situer au centre du pays,le village de louly est un village d\u2019agriculteur qui se donne surtout \u00e0 la culture de l\u2019arachide .\r\n<p>\r\nObjectif : Soutenir les familles en p\u00e9riode de soudure\r\nAm\u00e9liorer les conditions de vie \r\n<p>\r\n\r\nActivit\u00e9s : l\u2019activit\u00e9 consiste a acheter des moutons, les engraiss\u00e9s et les vendre dans les march\u00e9s hebdomadaires.\u00bb<p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":55267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase and fattening of sheep for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Louly Ngogom","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.7333 -16.4167","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2007-08-22T18:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abdou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-05T22:34:31Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":425,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2007-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2007-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":35.42},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":35.38}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":72,"local_amount":72,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:34:09Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:28Z","rounded_local_amount":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80012},{"amount":36,"local_amount":36,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:35:33Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93759},{"amount":72,"local_amount":72,"processed_date":"2008-02-16T20:58:42Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:44:12Z","rounded_local_amount":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136679},{"amount":72,"local_amount":72,"processed_date":"2008-04-06T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":174652},{"amount":36,"local_amount":36,"processed_date":"2008-05-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201942},{"amount":36,"local_amount":36,"processed_date":"2008-06-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":229190},{"amount":36,"local_amount":36,"processed_date":"2008-07-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:47:05Z","rounded_local_amount":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":258334},{"amount":36,"local_amount":36,"processed_date":"2008-08-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:47:54Z","rounded_local_amount":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287104},{"amount":29,"local_amount":29,"processed_date":"2008-09-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-15T07:16:11Z","rounded_local_amount":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":317386}],"funded_date":"2007-08-22T22:34:31Z","paid_date":"2008-09-15T07:16:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":20700,"name":"Salimata","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Salimata Kamagat\u00e9 is so professional, indeed.

M. is 44 years old. She lives in Corredores, in the southern region of Costa Rica, with her husband and four children. Maritza is in the textile business: she designs and produces shorts and pants by hand with her sewing machine. She started her business in November of 2006 with an initial investment of 700,000 colons ($1200 US) she sells her products from her home and from door to door in her neighbourhood. Her clothes are very popular, and at the moment she has more orders than she can keep up with. \r\n\r\nMaritza\u2019s main challenge has been securing a reliable and affordable supplier of raw materials. Currently, her supplier is located in San Isidro, which is close to her home, but the materials are expensive and delivery is unreliable. She knows a supplier in San Jose who is much more professional and affordable. Due to the longer distance and associated costs of distribution, the San Jose supplier requires a minimum quantity to be purchased with every order. Currently, she does not have enough capital to place a large enough order to satisfy this restriction. Maritza is applying for a loan of 500,000 colons, which will enable her to purchase larger quantities of materials from the source in San Jose. With your help, she will be able to purchase in bulk and take advantage of a lower price for the materials she needs. By switching suppliers, Maritza will increase her profit margins and use the income to improve her family\u2019s quality of life.\r\n\r\nMaritza has a strong work ethic; she devotes the hours from 7am to 6pm to her textile business. On a good day she can produce 10 articles of clothing. Shorts sell for 2500 colons (around $4US) while pants sell for 4000 colons (roughly$7US). The majority of sales are done in cash, and in a good month she earns 500,000 colons. In a bad month, she only earns 60,000 colons.  After accounting for the costs of raw materials, rent and machinery maintenance, Maritza uses her revenues to support her family.\r\n\r\nMaritza dreams of opening her own store where she could offer a more diverse range of products.\r\n\r\nYour contribution is a direct investment in the improvement of the lives of families living in a poor community of southern Costa Rica.

Guillermo is a dedicated farmer. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvesting of Cayenne and Habanero peppers. He works to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. In addition to his agricultural activity, Guillermo feels it is important to be an active member of his community. As a result, he dedicates a significant portion of his time to community meetings, groups and events. The rural zone where Guillermo lives is sparsely populated with infrequent bus service and a general lack of infrastructure. Guillermo is working hard and striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labor. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Guillermo and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbors help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Upala community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of Cayenne and Habanero peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labor and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Guillermo. The production cycle (from planting to harvest) for these types of peppers is roughly one year. Guillermo planted his peppers four months ago and will expect to harvest in the next eight months. Typically, he dedicates the hours from 6:00 AM to 4:00 PM everyday to his agricultural activities. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial (PROPICA) is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Upala, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe main obstacle Guillermo and other producers in the Upala community face is a lack of access to working capital funds. The collaboration of Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer and PROPICA represents a unique opportunity to Guillermo, his family and community. By offering a source of start-up capital and a guaranteed client to purchase what is produced, this is a chance to improve living conditions for Guillermo as well as the community at large. Above all, Guillermo wants to take advantage of the current opportunity that has been presented. He wants to profit from this collaboration and see improvements in his home and neighborhood. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":618261,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded Areas"],"use":"To purchase agricultural chemicals and nutrients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CR","country":"Costa Rica","town":"Upala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"10 -84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":151,"posted_date":"2010-10-15T23:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Guillermo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CRC","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65568.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66661.05},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67770.7}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.14},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.32},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":135.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":132.93,"local_amount":66466.67,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:42:46Z","rounded_local_amount":67623.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191428402},{"amount":133.35,"local_amount":66676.02,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:42:48Z","rounded_local_amount":67836.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196970541},{"amount":133.72,"local_amount":66857.31,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:18:41Z","rounded_local_amount":68020.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289986}],"funded_date":"2010-10-16T15:52:00Z","paid_date":"2011-04-16T08:18:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":242802,"name":"Ngin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ngin S. has been a farming businesswoman for a long time.

is 37 years old and married with 6 children.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maliumai joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Devina has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Devina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Devina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from HSPFI. Devina is requesting a new loan, which will be used to purchase additional firewood to sell. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Devina from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement income of her family and support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
