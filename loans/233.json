She is 55 years old. Nora is married and has six adult children. To make a living, Nora owns & operates a hog raising business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale. Nora has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nora joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from PMPC. Nora is requesting a new loan of 2000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Nora from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is happily married to Amabo Peter and has three children. She is a very hard-working young lady. She was unhappy after the death of her sister and family members due to hardship. Although she did not complete school because of lack of home training, ignorance, and especially poverty, she is still determined to succeed in life and provide for her children what her parents could not provide for her. \r\n\r\nShe plans to invest this loan in raising chickens and cows and selling gateau, a French almond cake. She is going to provide her community with chicken meat and food for her family and community. She will also sell the manure from the chickens to cultivate vegetables and farm products. Experience has taught her how to manage a business like this one. In addition, her farm is located in a very good area. \r\n\r\nShe will used the profit from the loan to educate her grandchildren and provide necessities and medication for them. A. loves GHAPE because of the low interest and the social interactions among members. These interactions bolster her loan use and management.   \r\n\r\n The Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":385857,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy chicken, cows, and oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntamulung, Bamenda, NW.

27 years old and a member of \u201cLa Estancia\u201d Communal Bank.  She lives in the community also named La Estancia and has two children, ages 8 and 1.  Gladys lives at home with her father because she is a single mother.  Her children are not acknowledged by their biological father, who should be contributing toward child support and household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nGladys tells us she lives in a highly agricultural area where most of the population grows flowers and fruits, such as apples, peaches, and plums, as well as engages in animal husbandry.  She decided to raise guinea pigs and chickens to sell at the Gualaceo Market.  \r\n<p>\r\nMotivated by her friends, Gladys joined the Communal Bank and has now participated in six loan cycles with the Foundation.  The loans have allowed her to succeed in her business and help her children get ahead.  With this new loan, Gladys says she will purchase feed for her animals such as grasses, corn, and vitamins.  Her goal is to grow her business over time so that she can continue supporting her children.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She got the idea of forming the network after participating in a training session run by Oxfam at Thi\u00e8s, in which she became familiar with group organization and running a business. The members of the group are dedicated to what they do, and meet together once a month. Over and above membership dues, each of them pays 200 FCFA a month into a group operating fund.\r\n\r\nLooking for financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC. The network is divided into 19 subgroups of five people so that financing can be better handled. Each subgroup has its own president and treasurer.\r\n\r\nThey now seek, for the second time, a loan of 100,000 FCFA per member or 500,000 FCFA for each subgroup, to grow their various activities. The members repay their loans to the president and the treasurer, Ms. Coumba Seck. They, in turn, are responsible for repaying U-IMCEC. According to the president, the group\u2019s praiseworthy objective is to fight family poverty.\r\n\r\nThe subgroup Femmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b0 4 consists of the president Ms. Fatoumata T., the treasurer Ms. A\u00efssatou W.

D. M. is 43 years old.  She is married and has 2 children.  She is the treasurer of the \u201cNuestra Se\u00f1ora D. Guadalupe\u201d (Our Lady of Guadalupe) community bank.  In the photo Edith is the lady wearing green pants and brown sweater.  She is sitting down on the far right.\r\n\r\nEdith started her business 7 years ago.  She never thought about becoming a saleswoman since her husband was a policeman and they managed with just his wage.  However, Edith started her business because her daughters were beginning their secondary education and she needed to extend and continue building their home since they lived in a rented house.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult for Edith to start out as a saleswoman since she had never worked before.  First she started selling clothes and cosmetics in her home but every holiday season she decided to change her business direction according to the season.  During the back-to-school season she sells school materials itinerantly and during the Christmas period she sells panettones, champagne and canned foods.  However, she still works in her clothes sales business since it provides a weekly income.\r\n\r\nEdith currently needs to work more since her husband is off work sick for 6 months as he fractured his knee.  Owing to the accident, he is no longer bringing in as much money as he used to.  Now Edith's strength to keep going comes from the need to continue educating her daughters so that they become professionals and the need to be able to offer them a better home, acquiring more things they need.  Her husband is currently helping her to look after their daughters and she can now go out to work while he gets better.\r\n\r\nEdith's loan will be used to extend her sales line this Christmas, adding to her sales of panettones by buying champagne and canned food."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3325,"image":{"id":649163,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To add merchandise to diversify her sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-11-23T21:50:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3325,"lender_count":110,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edith Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celedonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Veronica Liz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sara Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia Lucila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Mirtha Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1552},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1552},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1552},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1552},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1552},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1540}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":554.88},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":554.88},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":554.89},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":554.88},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":554.88},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":554.88,"local_amount":1552,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665382},{"amount":554.88,"local_amount":1552,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408625},{"amount":554.89,"local_amount":1552,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195826917},{"amount":554.88,"local_amount":1552,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-18T08:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201269178},{"amount":554.88,"local_amount":1552,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206136067},{"amount":550.59,"local_amount":1540,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:58:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1544.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211208570}],"funded_date":"2010-12-19T19:59:39Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:58:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":255500,"name":"Ely","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ely L. is from the village of Upper Inuman.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Begitu juga hal yang dialami oleh Ni Made Rani. Sudah menjadi tradisi wanita di desa, salah satu usaha yang dilakukan untuk menambah perekonomian keluarga adalah beternak babi. Namun yang menjadi kendala adala kurangnya pengetahuan akan beternak babi yang baik dan benar sehingga usaha yang ditekuni tidak menghasilkan dengan maksimal. Sebelumnya, Ni Made Rani hanya memelihara satu babi penggemukkan dan hanya diberi pakan tradisional yang berupa dedaunan dan sisa makanan di dapur. Hal seperti itu menyebabkan pertumbuhan babi tidak optimal dan tentunya berpengaruh terhadap harga jual. Setelah mendapat pembinaan dan pinjaman modal, sekarang Ni Made Rani memelihara 4 ekor babi yang dipisah dalam dua kandang. Hal itu dilakukannya untuk memudahkan perawatan dan pembersihan kandang. Pinjaman itu digunakan juga untuk membeli pakan yang berkwalitas sehingga sekarang pertumbuhan babinya pesat dan sehat. Dengan adanya perubahan cara beternak, hal ini berpengaruh terhadap pendapatan keluarganya, karena sekarang ia dapat menjual babinya dengan harga yang lebih tinggi.","en":"Ni Made Rani and her husband has one toddler.

She began learning this skill at a very young age.  Then, when her children were born, it was necessary to work and help with the family expenses; so she put into practice what she had learned.  She began making repairs to clothing that was taken to her house and, after some time, began making and selling clothes for her friends and neighbors.  Since Rubi already has experience in this field she is teaching other members so that they are able to have extra income for their households.  She is the president of the Communal Bank.\r\n<p>\r\nThe treasurer is Constantina P..  For 10 years, she has had a shop.  She began her business selling on an itinerant basis.  This was a very difficult situation until the municipality provided an area where all the itinerant businesses could establish themselves. It was there that she acquired a stall and put in her shop, the business that she has operated until now, but that is not all she does.  In her free time, Constantina crochets bags.  She learned this in a market where she brought yarn for weaving.  She makes different types of bags, and now she and other persons have the opportunity to export these to Mexico and Venezuela.\r\n<p>\r\nOrfelinda operates her business according to the season.  In the summer, she sells cold drinks.  In the winter she sells hot chocolate or mate.  She is the group\u2019s secretary.\r\n<p>\r\nAll are responsible and consider themselves fortunate because by means of honorable work they can offer their families the necessities of life.

M\u00f3nica works Monday through Sunday from 7am to 7pm.  In addition, she sells American clothes and Yanbal beauty products to friends and relatives.  She visits them in their homes so that they can view the products and place orders.\r\n<p> \r\nM\u00f3nica has been working with the Communal Bank for 3\u00bd years after her mother convinced her to join the group.  She says the loans have helped to increase her operating capital.  This current loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR will be used to buy American clothes such as pants, coats, blouses, etc.  Her greatest dream is to finish her studies so that she can become a professional teacher at a preschool and not depend on anyone.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

She\u2019s had a karaoke bar in town for the past two years.  Despite being a single mother, she\u2019s independent of her parents and has been her 4-year-old daughter\u2019s sole source of support.  This motivates Diana to invest in this business because there is no other like it in town and it is the only place where people can go for amusement.\r\n\r\nDiana is a very responsible person and to date has had no problem repaying her loans to the foundation.  She has used prior loans to provide her business with chairs, tables, a freezer, a computer, a sound mixer, microphone and beverages.

With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Miguela has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 to add more products to sell to her customers so that she can continue to save up for the future improvement of her business. Miguela is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Teachers from this institution, like their many counterparts in SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT\/Kiva lenders to seek loans. These loans have proven to be very helpful to salaried workers because they empower recipients to buy or invest in things that their salaries cannot cover. For example, with the help of loans, recipients are able to buy a plot of land, start building a house, buy house-building materials and furniture, or pay school fees for their children. At the end of each month, the group finance officer repays SMT\/Kiva on their behalf.\r\n\r\nMomodu is the leader of this group of teachers. He is 49 years old and was born in the town of Port Loko. Momodu is married and has 11 children, eight of whom are attending primary and secondary schools.

This is one of the newest cities in Ecuador.  It has become a key city linking the mountains and the coastal area of the country.

The main fiesta of Santo Domingo is celebrated with a lot of visitors and a lot of commercial and cultural exchange.  A large cattle market takes place in the Farmers' Association facilities.

With this loan, her business will be more prosperous.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p>NOTE: This $850 loan will go to fund Maria's business, as well as four other businesses within her solidarity group. They have gone through Esperanza's business training program and will receive shares of this $850 loan to invest in their respective businesses and pay back the loan together. The entire group must pay in full and on time, otherwise group members must make up the deficit before any payment can be made. This creates accountability among the group members because each one shares in the success and struggles of the other members in their group.\r\n<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":30433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase, flour, sugar, dried milk, bread, gasoline, soap, butter, bread and sauses among various household items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"Consuelo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.833333 -69.266667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2007-04-18T06:22:28Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-02T20:13:27Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":850,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2007-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2007-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":141.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":141.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":141.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":142,"local_amount":142,"processed_date":"2007-06-02T09:20:18Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-02T17:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":142,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":19604},{"amount":142,"local_amount":142,"processed_date":"2007-07-02T09:21:50Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-02T17:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":142,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":28290},{"amount":142,"local_amount":142,"processed_date":"2007-08-02T09:24:10Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-02T17:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":142,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":38160},{"amount":142,"local_amount":142,"processed_date":"2007-09-02T09:25:21Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-02T17:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":142,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":49595},{"amount":142,"local_amount":142,"processed_date":"2007-10-02T09:24:31Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-02T17:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":142,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":61798},{"amount":140,"local_amount":140,"processed_date":"2007-11-02T10:25:48Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-02T17:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":140,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":75271}],"funded_date":"2007-04-18T20:13:27Z","paid_date":"2007-11-02T10:25:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12944,"name":"Adama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Adama T. is married with three children.

This has enabled her to attract a lot of customers to the extent that she is no longer able to satisfy them because of lack of funds. For this reason she took out a first loan in 2006 of CFA 40,000 in order to strengthen her business. The experience was beneficial as she was able to meet all the demand.

From the time she was a girl, she knew what it meant to work on a farm and she learned the jobs required to run one.  Six years ago, she started growing alfalfa, a grass that is used to feed animals.  Growing and selling alfalfa is very profitable because most of the people in the area keep animals and have to feed them.  Mary meets the demand.  She has to cut the alfalfa every fifteen days in order to sell it.  This is her 13th MFP loan and she's never missed paying an installment on a past loan.

She is a very resourceful mother whose hard work brings livelihood to the family.\r\n\r\n<P>Faustina supports her two grandchildren through the sale of used clothing, curtains, clothing materials and bedsheets. There is a large market for used clothing, curtains, and bedsheets in Ghana, because brand new clothes are very expensive for the economically active poor.

Marceline lives in a mountainous area to the west of Kinshasa, where she works at her small business selling salted fish.  Besides selling fish, she also sells <i>chikwangues<\/i> (a kind of bread made of cassava flour).  Sometimes, her customers eat these foods on site or take them home.  Basically, she\u2019s in the midst of starting up a mini-restaurant.  Right now, her capital amounts to $72.  She started her business in 2000 with $15 of initial capital that had enabled her to buy some charcoal to resell.  Her business prospered through 2006.  \r\n<p>\r\nMarceline\u2019s ill health, caused by a surgery undergone in 2006-2007, prevented her from doing commerce fully.  In the second half of 2007 through today, she started back up again by including fresh fish.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe joined one of groups of the micro-finance institution HOPE named \u201cJoyce\u201d in February 2008 with the goal of receiving renewable financial support for developing her business.  She received loans from HOPE four times, and she repaid them regularly and completely.  In April, she used the loan received to buy some salted fish, and she diversified by including kerosene, as well as vegetable oil, intending to grow her revenues.  \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, her business generates for her a profit of $33 a week.  Her ambition is to buy a freezer with the goal of preserving the fresh staple goods that her customers  have often needed.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3300,"image":{"id":306815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy salted fish and to diversify her business with kerosene and vegetable oil for increasing her income","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

Together with his wife he has been raising cattle for more than 14 years. This produces the income which allows him to feed his children and his wife. As well as caring for his livestock, he also cultivates wheat, which helps with the family's diet and provides additional income. Sultonmurod has asked for this loan to buy young cattle in order to obtain a better profit. His greatest wish is to be able to improve his farm by constructing enclosures and establishing better grazing for his livestock.  \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

So she decided to work selling sodas and ice cream from the first floor of her mother\u2019s house. She has worked for fifteen years in this business and she has enjoyed it. Actually, she also sells beer. The largest quantities of beer sales are during the weekends. She is well known to her neighbors and thanks to them her business has generated a good income. She is very motivated to continue working. In the upcoming months she is going to begin to knit sweaters. Her neighbor, who knits, invited her to join her in this work. She can knit while she works in her store. In the future she would like to install booths with Internet access in her large location. She would like to sell time on the Internet.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

His vitality helps him every day to work and protect his family, which is comprised of his wife and their two daughters.  His family lives together in a small house.  The experience he had when he was younger caused him to work solely in public transportation.  He works from 4:00 pm until the early hours of the morning, according to his work schedule from the transportation company for whom he was worked for more than 10 years.  The disagreeable aspects of his job as a driver are that it causes him some physical discomfort and he does not have much time to rest.  However he has to work for the well being of his family.  He has thought of starting an extra business with his wife since she has a lot of skill in sales.  They want to take full advantage of that skill by putting a store in their home, as there is a scarcity of that type of business in their  neighborhood  and a lot of demand from their neighbors and friends.  This is his first loan with MFP, and he is certain this opportunity will help him keep growing.  Furthermore, he is considered to be a very responsible person who will make the loan payments on time.

married and has 4 children.  Together with her husband, she is involved in livestock feeding and sales in order to support their family.  She lives in a village where there is no work.  The main source of income is agriculture and money transfers from Russia.  Her oldest son sends some money home, but because of the economic crisis, he has not sent any money last two months.  Gulbahor sold a bull and planned to buy a dairy cow.  However, because the cow costs more than she expected, Gulbahor requested a loan from MicroInvest.

She has 4 children and currently lives with one of them.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter her husband passed away, Nieves was worried that she would not be able to maintain her crops on her own.  Thanks to God, she has been able to maintain the same level of vitality and energy so that she can continue working in the fields.  Nieves works every day on her farm from 10am to 5pm.  Whenever there is too much work for her to handle, she has the support of her children who live nearby.\r\n<p>\r\nNieves recently recovered from a fracture she suffered as a result of a heavy fall.  Despite her age, she is determined to keep fighting and improving her crops.  She mentions that her work is the only thing that keeps her mind off her loneliness and the absence of her husband.  Nieves is also grateful for the land she possesses, since it is the means by which she provided sustenance and an education for her children who are now grown.\r\n<p>\r\nNieves is receiving her seventh loan with MFP.  Her greatest desire is to continue farming.  She says that she has great affection for the members of her Communal Bank, who have been very supportive.  She also admits to being the person who always arrives first at their monthly meetings.  Nieves will use the money to buy carrot and spinach seeds for the next planting season.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":425772,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-15T11:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nieves","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:08:33Z","rounded_local_amount":502.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734776},{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886554}],"funded_date":"2009-11-15T18:10:02Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":156543,"name":"Virina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virina is a single mother with three sons, all of whom are grown, ages 29, 23, and 19.

Desde hace alg\u00fan tiempo se independiz\u00f3 y ahora vive en su casa propia ubicada en la localidad de Santa Rosa Yapaz (selva central peruana). Hace 6 a\u00f1os, que se dedica a la siembra de caf\u00e9, pl\u00e1tano, fr\u00e9joles y ma\u00edz. Despu\u00e9s de cada cosecha vende su producci\u00f3n a los intermediarios en la ciudad de Santa Ana. Lo que m\u00e1s le desagrada a Yuseff, son los problemas de bajo costo de su producci\u00f3n, pero \u00e9l es m\u00e1s astuto y constantemente busca nuevos mercados para poder comercializar sus productos. Pero no desea conformarse, es as\u00ed que espera tener otro ingreso con la venta de madera, negocio que desea incursionar, pues sabe que de las ganancias que reciba podr\u00e1 invertir en la siembra de 6 hect\u00e1reas de terrenos agr\u00edcolas aproximadamente. Es el tercer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, y cuenta que en este corto tiempo, gan\u00f3 la confianza de mucho de los integrantes de su banco comunal, quienes est\u00e1n agradecidos por el apoyo que en todo este tiempo obtuvieron. Es por ello que ya ha pensado invertir el cr\u00e9dito en la compra de 20 sacos de abono y, si el dinero le alcanza invertir\u00e1 en la compra de una motosierra (m\u00e1quina que le sirve para poder cortar \u00e1rboles).\n\n","en":"Yuseff, 31 years old, is a single and hard-working man.  Some time ago he became independent and now he lives in his own home located in the town of Santa Rosa Yapaz (central Peruvian jungle).  For six years, he has been sowing coffee, bananas, beans and corn.  After each harvest, he sells his production to intermediaries in the city of Santa Ana.  What Yuseff dislikes most are the problems of low costs of his production, but he is more astute and is constantly searching new markets to market his products.

the Santa Clara market in the middle of Ayacucho, Per\u00fa, Lilia sits on a stool behind a mountain of fresh vegetables and grains. For the past 10 years, Lilia, or \u201cLiliana,\u201d as her friends and neighbors know her, has been selling carrots, celery, tomatoes, onions, broccoli, cauliflower, and just about every other vegetable imaginable to her community in this small Andean city. <P>\r\n\r\nBefore there were vegetables, there were cereals. These Lilia also sold and continues to sell in the market from her stand. The cereals consist of everything from wheat to barley, and they come from the country just outside the city limits. After several years of selling only cereals, it was clear to Lilia that she was not making enough profit to support a healthy lifestyle. Thus, she decided she needed to increase the variety of products she sold in order to supplement her income. This she did, and it is now to vegetables that she dedicates the majority of her time and energy. She happily reports that her decision was a great success, and she now serves a large number of regular customers counting on her for their daily supply of leafy greens and cereals. It is a very important business concept, explains Lilia. If one does not provide a variety of products, the customers will shop elsewhere. <P>\r\n\r\nThis motivated 27 year-old has many goals and aspirations for her growing vegetable business. She says she is always looking for ways to improve, and she has her eye set on a permanent stand within the market. Currently, Lilia is an \u201cambulante,\u201d which means she sells from a mobile stand and spends most of the day walking. A permanent stand would allow her greater consistency and the supply of a much greater quantity of products. This is an especially important time for Lilia to be expanding her business as she is newly pregnant with her first child. Thanks to her village bank, such expansion is a real possibility. For the past 3 years, Lilia has learned how to save her money and she says thanks to her bank, she has increased exponentially the amount of products she is able to move daily.

To make a living, Jennie owns & operates a sari-sari store selling a variety of different products in the local community. Jennie has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 7000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Jennie joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Jennie has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Jennie is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Jennie from PMPC.

His business is located next to the Francisco Lara School where he has the advantage of having the only other structure.

At the same time he also wants to include new merchandise that has high demand such as candy and soft drinks.  Victor works with one employee who is charge of making the prepared foods that he sells.  They both work very hard Monday through Saturday throughout the entire day.

What she basically does is buy a quantity of fresh fish from the market and process them by smoking them until they are ready to sell. She packs these dried fish at prices ranging from 15 PHP, 30 PHP and 50 PHP depending on the quantity of fish per pack. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 200-300 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<p>\r\nTo help her continue operations, she is requesting a 14,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities and varieties of fish to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n<p>\r\nConcepcion dreams of giving her child a good and high quality education through her hard work in her business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Meet Annah. She is a lovely self-driven smallholder farmer. She lives in Eldoret, Kenya, together with the husband to whom she has been married for over 10 years!  \r\n\r\nAnnah has been doing mixed-farming for two decades. She considers herself to be more passionate and hardworking than other farmers. She also leaves nothing to chance when carrying out her duties.\r\n\r\nShe is seeking a KES 130,000 loan to purchase farm equipment and a dairy cow. Acquisition of these assets is aligned to her plan of growing her agribusiness to the next level. On her farm, she grows two acres of maize. She also keeps four highly productive dairy cows, ten hens and goats. For the past few years, her biggest challenge has been the tools being used on the farm. They are outdated and worn out to say the least. As a result, farm work has become strenuous and time consuming. She spends more resources on labour since working with these tools requires a lot of effort yet the quality of work keeps deteriorating. \r\n\r\nAnnah is going to use this loan to purchase modern farm equipment that will bring effectiveness and efficiency to her farm work. New improved tools will not only save her on labour costs but also improve the quality of work. The dairy cow she will acquire will boost the overall income she gets from milk.\r\n\r\nAnnah counts herself lucky to be among those who had a supportive upbringing being the third born in a family of seven children. She went through school and completed her secondary education without much difficulty. Today, the education she acquired helps her to keep her financial records straight through a budget that she reviews annually. She also stated that she always monitors and keeps records of her expenses. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1755270,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"buy tools for farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Eldoret","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.516667 35.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Annah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-12-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":26,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3812.97},{"due_date":"2015-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3924.4},{"due_date":"2015-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":4039.09},{"due_date":"2015-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4157.14},{"due_date":"2015-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4278.63},{"due_date":"2015-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4403.67},{"due_date":"2015-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4532.37},{"due_date":"2015-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4664.83},{"due_date":"2015-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4801.16},{"due_date":"2015-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":4941.47},{"due_date":"2015-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5085.89},{"due_date":"2015-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5234.52},{"due_date":"2016-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5387.5},{"due_date":"2016-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5544.95},{"due_date":"2016-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":5707},{"due_date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":5873.79},{"due_date":"2016-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6045.45},{"due_date":"2016-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6222.18},{"due_date":"2016-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6403.97},{"due_date":"2016-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6591.13},{"due_date":"2016-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6783.75},{"due_date":"2016-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":6982.01},{"due_date":"2016-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":7186.06},{"due_date":"2016-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":7396.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.53},{"due_date":"2015-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.77},{"due_date":"2015-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.05},{"due_date":"2015-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.37},{"due_date":"2015-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.72},{"due_date":"2015-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.12},{"due_date":"2015-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.55},{"due_date":"2015-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.03},{"due_date":"2015-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.55},{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.12},{"due_date":"2016-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.73},{"due_date":"2016-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.39},{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.09},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.85},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.65},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.52},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.43},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.4},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.43},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.52},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.66},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.88},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80.15},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":82.49}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hanh Vu","image":null}},{"id":993961,"name":"Francisco","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Francisco es de la ciudad de Luque, est\u00e1 Casado con la Sra.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.
