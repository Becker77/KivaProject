Together they have a beautiful family with four children, but they only live with two of them in their own house located in the town of Alto Yapaz (central Peruvian jungle).  The smile that she is known for is a product of her attitude to work.  \r\n\r\nFor 20 years, she has been a farmer, planting coffee and pineapple in her agricultural lands located in the high area of San Fransisco.  She spends most of her day there, and says there are days when she stays there to rest in a hut she set up between her plantations.  She says, \"I like to keep my crops clean.\"  She says that this year the price of coffee is very good, so she predicts she will earn a good income.  Her main difficulty is the lack of working capital, so she also plants pineapple, where she invests a larger quantity of money, and it also requires more care.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

That's why she began to grow potatoes, olluco (a root vegetable), and lima beans on her own land. \r\n\r\nShe says that she gets a good return at every harvest, as she sells her crops in the country's capital, Lima, in Pampas or in Huancayo. It all depends on the price she is offered, says Josefina.  As well, she has cows, sheep and other livestock that provide her with milk, which she uses to feed herself, or sells, depending on the quantity of liters that she gets from her livestock. \r\n\r\nNow she wishes to increase the number of animals she has, and improve her crops, in order to have good earnings. She belongs to the \"Sol Naciente\" communal bank, and this is her second loan with MFP. She feels fulfilled with the group, as its members are supportive and very hard-working.\r\n\r\nIn addition, she promises to pay her instalments on time. When she gets the loan, Josefina will use the money applied for to buy natural fertilizers for her potato crop."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":955786,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy sacks of fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-23T22:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josefina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:10Z","rounded_local_amount":808.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451236}],"funded_date":"2011-12-24T00:13:32Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":378157,"name":"Yorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Yorn, 55, is widowed and resides with four children in Kampong Chhnang Province, Cambodia.

The Facilitator  from the organization, who meets with them at their monthly meetings, speaks their native language of Quiche and conducts educational trainings with the women using games, role playing, diagrams and pictures. A different subject is covered at each meeting. The ladies learn about effective business practices (budgeting, accounting, marketing, pricing), as well as women\u2019s rights, women\u2019s health, nutrition and hygiene. The useful combination of small loans and education is called \u201cMicrocredit Plus\u201d.\n\nMomostenango is a busy commercial center and people from all over the area come into the town to transact business and do their marketing. The women of the Trust Bank are involved in various commercial endeavors and are pleased to see so many customers visit from neighboring villages. The President of the Trust Bank is 39 year old Pascuala, who was only able to stay in school through the second grade. She is married and has seven children. Three of them attend the university, while the other four are still in primary school. Pascuala has two businesses: animal husbandry and two internet cafes that her children help her manage. The businesses have grown and Pascuala finds it necessary to secure a loan since she wants to expand them even more. The internet cafe is popular but there are only a few computers. She would like to purchase two more computers, as well as have money to repair some of the existing computers.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Malienafau has many years of experience in this business.  Malienafau needs a loan of WST $1450 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 tala or US $83 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Malienafau joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Malienafau's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Malienafau M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.99 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.99 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is a tireless and extremely devoted woman who works hard to bring up her children  and who fights for their success. Her business is turning palm nuts into red palm oil, which is very popular and widely consumed in Togo. This seasonal activity is very prosperous because of all of the palm oil by-products that represent additional sources of income. Today Ms. Hoesseh A. needs a loan of $600 to buy palm nuts and to build a large stock of them to sell in periods of high demand. This opportunity will allow her to increase her production and her income so that she can meet the basic needs of her children, who are practically her responsibility alone.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from French by Kristina Jackson, Kiva Volunteer.<p><\/b>\r\n\r\nMari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de trois (03) enfants, Madame A.

Because customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, the women lack tangible collateral assets, and financial institutions do not consider them to be credit-worthy. This leads to poor financial support and, as a result, limited access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<\/P>\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. When a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys the equipment from the client, extends a loan to her, and then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a \"sale and leaseback\" arrangement.<\/P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":152089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional crops in bulk for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-04-23T13:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-08T17:53:09Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-06-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:35:15Z","rounded_local_amount":80080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232028},{"amount":65,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-07-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:22Z","rounded_local_amount":80080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":261133},{"amount":65,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-08-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":80080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":290031},{"amount":65,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-09-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:27:04Z","rounded_local_amount":80080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":320388},{"amount":65,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-10-08T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-18T07:20:33Z","rounded_local_amount":80080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":352635},{"amount":65,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-11-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:22:54Z","rounded_local_amount":80080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347611},{"amount":65,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:14Z","rounded_local_amount":80080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970231},{"amount":65,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:51Z","rounded_local_amount":80080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886481},{"amount":65,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:06Z","rounded_local_amount":80080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435766},{"amount":65,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":80080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130071}],"funded_date":"2008-04-24T17:53:09Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":49505,"name":"Thi Quy","description":{"languages":["vi"],"texts":{"vi":"Mrs \u0110inh Th\u1ecb Qu\u00fd is 35 years old.

This is 35-year-old Saidat S. from Mwanza, a beautiful city on the shores of Lake Victoria.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Viia has many years of experience in this business.  Viia needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 tala or US $83 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Viia joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Viia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Viia F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

This group is led by Oktofianus J., who is 30 years old. Oktofianus was born to a farming family. He is married and has been blessed with a cute daughter, Nadia, who is 3 years old. Oktofianus only has secondary education as his childhood was mostly spent on the farm rather than at school. He loves farming.\r\n\r\nOktofianus and his family live in a modest house. As a farmer, he relies on agriculture for income to meet his family's needs. He plants vegetables, tomatoes, chilies, bananas and coconuts on the farm. According to Oktofianus, vegetables and tomatoes are the most important agricultural products that he harvests and sells to traders. He works on the farm from 6 am to 4 pm every day. As the breadwinner, Oktofianus has to work hard to generate more income to provide his family, especially his daughter, with sufficient and nutritious food. \r\n\r\nOktofianus says that he doesn\u2019t have to sell his agricultural products at the market since his customers come to buy directly from him. His customers mostly come from Inpres Market which is situated about 37 km from Bone Village. They usually come to buy his crops every two weeks. The income that he generates is unstable. He can generate up to 600,000 Indonesian rupiah (IDR) over a two week period. \r\n\r\nOktofianus has a goal to improve his family's standard of living, but he only has limited skills. He faces difficulties in meeting his family\u2019s daily needs as food and other necessities are quite expensive at the market. This situation drives him to find other ways to better meet his family's needs.  Recently he heard information about the TLM Cattle Fattening Program that assists poor farmers like him. He is interested in joining the program as he has fertile land where the grass grows well for cattle food.\r\n\r\nOktofianus is requesting a loan of 3,200,000 IDR to buy a young cow to be fattened over a 12 month period. Just like Oktofianus, the other group members are also requesting loans to buy young cattle so they can improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\nNote: Melkianus and Lodia were replaced by their family members when the group picture was taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3150,"image":{"id":508032,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cattle to be fattened","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Bone","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2010-03-18T00:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3150,"lender_count":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oktofianus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Simson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Selfiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marlinus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Melkianus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Satri","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yakoba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lodia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lebrine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":28800000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":3150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":28800000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":3150,"local_amount":28800000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":28869750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195922583}],"funded_date":"2010-03-21T18:57:39Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:25:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laurie Russell","image":1324922}},{"id":189662,"name":"Zuhair","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zuhair A.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Zubeda has been running a plastic business since 2005. She purchases rolls of clear plastic, cuts the plastic, and seals one end to make bags that closely resemble the bags you receive when you purchase a fish from the fish store. She then bundles several bags together and sells them to vendors of all sorts, who may pile tiny mangos or figs into the bags to sell to people who pass by foot, car, or daladala (mini city buses).\r\n<p>\r\nZubeda is requesting a loan of $400 in order to purchase additional plastic material and a machine that cuts the plastic.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":224998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase plastic material to make bags and a machine that cuts the plastic","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-12T23:50:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zubeda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T09:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970762},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886979},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436239},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130511},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:25:58Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027308},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613327},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:58Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010410},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:36Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232721},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664537},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:05Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105268}],"funded_date":"2008-11-13T15:32:32Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Olson","image":null}},{"id":78212,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evelyn O. sells provisions in her shop.

(the first person on the left in the photograph) organized a retirement home called \u201cSunshine\u201d for people between the ages 60-90 years old.

Today, Tatiana has 11 elderly people in the home and 5 staff workers. \r\n\r\n<P>Tatiana financed the retirement home entirely with her own money. The local government provided an old building (a former kindergarten) to use free of charge for fifteen years. Tatiana managed to make some small renovations in the building. She bought 20 beds (the total capacity is 60 people) and purchased equipment for the kitchen and dining room. Because \u201cSunshine\u201d does not have enough cash assets, all of the workers work for free and hope to be paid a salary when better times come. Nowadays, the retirement home exists only with the aid of the retiree\u2019s pensions.<\/P> \r\n\r\n<P>Tatiana hopes to use loan money to purchase a cow and two sheep. Milk and meat from the livestock will be used for cooking. Also, some amount of milk and meat can be sold in the market. Additional food and all the necessary materials will be purchased. Also, Tatiana expects the older people to participate in the process of livestock breeding in order to fill their free time with an interesting hobby.<\/P> \r\n\r\n<P>Tatiana S. is married and has three sons. She and her husband operate the retirement home and their sons try to help whenever they have free time. Tatiana comments: \u201cI love this house.

Since both schools from the villages of Mabanta and Makama operate on the same payroll, they have merged to seek a loan from Kiva through SMT.  <P>\r\n\r\nTeachers from these institutions, like many other teachers within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest  in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.<P>\r\n\r\nFifty-four-year-old Solomon S. K. (right) is the head master at the school.  He was born in a village called Rogbin. He is married with 3 children, 2 of whom are in Junior Secondary Schools II (JSS II) while the eldest is in a Teachers' Training College pursuing a Higher Teachers\u2019 Certificate.

Jovita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12000 PHP from GDMPC and is now requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Jovita from GDMPC.

It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte, and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Though Loda\u2019s husband supports her and her children financially, the woman still wants to be productive in her own way to support her own education and the needs of her children. Her husband\u2019s income is yet too small to support things her family needs to be able to experience life beyond poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nWhen Loda joined ASHI in 2003, she requested a loan to start a \u201csari-sari\u201d (variety) store, selling inventories of foodstuffs, beverages and other basic commodities for people in their village to purchase conveniently. Frequently her business can't be sustained and she has had to periodically shut it down. The loans she has received have been a great help in restoring her business. Despite those circumstances, Loda makes sure that she maintains an excellent repayment record with ASHI and attends the weekly ASHI center meetings. Assisted by her husband in fulfilling her responsibilities to ASHI,  Loda is now requesting a loan to improve her business and to fully achieve her dream of making it sustainable and profitable to be

Seven years ago, she began making handcrafted wallets and even her children helped out in whatever way they could.  Today one of her children is responsible for making the designs, another secures the studs and etches the designs, and she handles the sewing and making the finishing touches to each of the wallets.  Whenever they receive large orders, they must work together and strive to deliver on time.  One of her children is in charge of maintaining samples of what they have created in order to show to new buyers.

She successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from ASKI which she used to purchase piglets to raise and sell in the future.

farmers in Webuye District, Kenya.

He is married and has two children.\r\n\r\nWith a portion of this loan, Benard will not only purchase maize seeds and fertilizer for the coming harvesting season, but also a solar light.

Friends told her not to lose heart as a result of her failures, and suggested that she sell food out of her house, since she had experience. A neighbor lent her a table and she bought 4 chairs and started her business. Her son fixed up a place in the house and she started with 8 people.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

He grew up in a typical family environment, however, his father passed away when he was 10 years old, and he  says he started to have difficulties studying because he didn't have anyone to support him.  His only option was to look for work so in 1963 he was hired at the Industrial Plastic Company where he worked until he retired.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 1969 he married and moved to Catembe with his wife where they had children referenced above.  He continued working for his company as a mechanic.   He began searching for a way to keep himself busy opening a workshop to provide various services in the metal working arena with a lathe and saw in his back yard.  His level of service is good.<p>\r\n\r\nHe came to know Hluvuku through his brother that happens to be a client and has already had several loans which were paid off without problems.  With this loan of 20MT he intends to purchase a machine to cut metal for his workshop that is open at 8am and closes at 6pm depending on the demand and favorable economic conditions.  His monthly profit is around 3MT and with these earnings he is able to support a family, pay the loan, and still make some improvements on the machinery.  In the future he envisions opening a shop to wash, lubricate, and align wheels and other services and may possibly need credit.<p>\r\n<b>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva

emprego e assim em 1963 foi contratado na Companhia Industrial de Pl\u00e1sticos onde trabalhou at\u00e9 a reforma.\r\nEm 1969 casa-se e passa a viver na catembe com sua esposa donde tiveram os filhos acima referidos e continuou a trabalhar na Companhia acima com Torneiro-mec\u00e1nico.\r\nAssim procura criar  uma forma de se ocupar criando uma oficina como forma de dar resposta aos v\u00e1rios

This is 32-year-old Janeth M. from Mwanza. She is married with three children between the ages of two and 10. Janeth has been running a milling machine since 2000. Farmers come from the surrounding area to provide their corn to be ground into maize. Maize is very important to the Tanzanian culture: it is used to make one of their staple dishes, ugali, which is made solely of maize flour and water. Janeth works at the business for 12 hours per day, seven days per week and is assisted by two employees. She currently earns about 50 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase large sacks to store the ground maize which she sells in bulk.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":225040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase large sacks to store ground maize","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-19T00:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Janeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T06:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970769},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:16:01Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886986},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436246},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130518},{"amount":85,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:28Z","rounded_local_amount":105400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027315}],"funded_date":"2008-11-19T02:33:07Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":78228,"name":"Francisco Javier","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Francisco Javier L. tiene la edad de 33 a\u00f1os, habita en el reparto Juan  Ram\u00f3n Padilla, el desde hace cinco a\u00f1o trabaja como comerciante de frutas y verduras, es soltero el habita junto a su mam\u00e1 y hermanos el cual con el esfuerzo de su mam\u00e1 y hermanos han logrado establecer un poco su negocio.

She is married and has one adult child.  To make a living, Leonia owns & operates a business raising cattle for sale.  Leonia has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 2000 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Leonia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Leonia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 2250 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional animals.  Leonia is now requesting a new loan of 2200 WST, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future.  The loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Leonia from SPBD.  Leonia plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Thanks to all of these years, she has regular customers and she can get daily income.  Also, three years ago she bought a \u201cmotocarro\u201d (a three wheeled motorized cart).  A year later she bought another one.  Two of her sons work with these vehicles transporting passengers.  Every day they give their earnings to Luz to manage.\r\n\r\nThis is her eighth loan with MFP.

old. Their children are: Marisol, age 15 and Mary Joy, age 13, both still studying; Elmer, age 32, now married; Melvin, age 30, also married; and Mary Ann, age 22, still single.\r\n\r\nCelerina\u2019s husband has been working continuously as a security guard in Taytay Rizal for fifteen years now and this was the one source of their income. But, because they have more expenses in their house plus the expenses of two children in school, Celerina had to think of another way to augment her husband\u2019s insufficient salary.\r\n\r\nThe solution that Celerina thought of is to start a business that fits their place to produce an extra income. But one of her dilemmas in starting the business was a lack of capital for it. Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) is the one who solved her dilemma.\r\n\r\nCelerina joined ASHI in 2004 and the loan that she received from the institution was used as capital to start the business that she thought of, which is food preparation. Now she wants to again use a loan to improve her business. She wants to buy some necessary things needed in her business like a different bowl where the menu is placed. She also wants to diversify her menu for a much bigger income.\r\n\r\nCelerina does everything to make her business grow more. She exerts more effort with the help of her daughter, Mary Ann. Celerina is the one who will buy the ingredients in the afternoon and cook them the next morning and Mary Ann will sell the food. Celerina really does everything to make her business grow in order for her children, and also her grandchildren, to experience a better life.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":405023,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

By working hard in her restaurant business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 12,000.

She is married to Ramil, a graphic artist, and is mother to her only child. She, together with her husband, manage their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.  \r\n\r\nMarivic operates an LPG business. What she basically does is buy liquefied petroleum gas tanks from wholesalers and sells them per tank with a little profit. LPG tanks can range from small to regular size tanks. Aside from this, she also retails electronic cellphone loads (prepaid cellphone credits) and offers direct selling products. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 2,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a 41,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more stock of LPG tanks to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nMarivic dreams of having other branches someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week, and she also draws strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies there.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

Mrs. Sokvorn C. is the village bank president wH. has been selected by the members. She is a farmer wH. owns a piece of land to cultivate both rice and vegetables. In her vegetable growing she faces an obstacle because she does not have vegetable seeds for growing. Thus, she decided to ask for a loan to buy vegetable seeds to grow on the field. Her husband, Mr. Nget Thy, is a driver for a garment factory. Mrs. Srey O. did not come to take a loan but her husband was, so he is presented in the picture instead. \r\n\r\nOne member in this group loan is an end-of-term loan and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor. It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able.

Her husband works as an independent welder but does not earn enough to pay for household expenses or for their children's education. That's why she decided to help him by opening her business, which she started twelve years ago.\r\n\r\nAt first, Kunduz sold to her neighbors and, little by little, her business has been growing and now she sells in the markets. Her oldest daughter helps her in the business and wishes to continue to make it grow.\r\n\r\nKunduz is requesting a loan for 12,300 Somoni to purchase fresh vegetables for making salads. She and her family are very grateful for the support that you give to allow them to continue their business and improve their quality of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have three children:  Ezer, 22 years old, Wilder, who is 19, and Gisela, 16.  They live in a house they own, located in the eastern part of Per\u00fa.\r\n\r\nTogether with the whole family, she dedicates herself to growing bananas, coffee and avocado.  She has been farming since she was very young, having learned the trade from her parents.  The crops she grows are the most produced in her region of the country.\r\n\r\nFelicita\u2019s greatest wish is for her children to pursue their studies in the city, since in the zone where they live there are not many opportunities for a good education.  In addition, she would like them to have the many things that she and her husband never managed to have in life.  Felicita enjoys her work because she is doing it on her own land, and she can harvest her crops without any problems.  In addition, she enjoys working with her husband and children who help her generate a good income for the family.  She sells her products to wholesalers who pay a good price for seasonal products.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth time she\u2019s had a loan with MFP, and she promises to be responsible with her repayments as she would like access to credit in the future to reach her goals.

She lives with her youngest child, who is 15 years old, and cares for him.  Together with her husband, they all live together in a house they own.  For the past 5 years, she has run a business selling coal.  Since starting up, she has not stopped working, and travels great distances in order to obtain her product.  The coal is then sold to the brick factories that are plentiful in the area where she lives.  This raw material serves as fuel for the large condensation ovens that are common in these factories.\r\n\r\nThis enterprise has given her good results due to the great demand for coal.  For this reason, she constantly buys the material and stockpiles it on the porch of her home.  Her immediate plan is to buy the coal in greater quantities.  This is her second credit with MFP, and she promises to be very responsible with her loan payments.  In addition, she feels this contribution will be very helpful to her in growing her business.  She plans to purchase a truckload of coal with the loan she is requesting.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":525734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more coal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-19T11:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":188},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":184}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.94},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.94},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.93},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.47}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":68.93,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:26Z","rounded_local_amount":195.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718261},{"amount":68.94,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:48Z","rounded_local_amount":195.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751947},{"amount":68.93,"local_amount":188,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:17Z","rounded_local_amount":195.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934402},{"amount":137.87,"local_amount":376,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":390.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886999},{"amount":137.86,"local_amount":376,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":390.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449301},{"amount":67.47,"local_amount":184,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":191.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588033}],"funded_date":"2010-04-24T22:22:00Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":197905,"name":"Ny's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This group loan consists of four people located in Prey Rumdeng village in Takeo province.

For three years, this enterprising mother has been selling a variety of meals in her area.  Every day, after cooking in her home, she wraps up her pots, takes them out on her cart and starts selling her meals: 'chanfainita' (a traditional Peruvian dish), 'tallarines rojos' (another traditional Peruvian dish - literally 'red noodles'), and chicken stews.  Over time, she has been able to attract a lot of customers who enjoy her delicious meals, above all the drivers at the 'mototaxi' (auto rickshaw) stands.\r\n\r\nWhat Maribel most likes about her work is that it is very profitable and, for that reason, she has been able to hire a young lady to help her.  However, she is also worried about the increase in the number of itinerant street vendors who also sell meals and who have set up near her business.  For this reason, in the future she is thinking of renting premises and setting up a restaurant so that she can proviD. her customers with a better service.\r\n\r\nThis is Maribel's 13th loan with MFP and she has pledged, once again, to be responsible in making her loan repayments.

A mother of 4 children, she became a widow 30 years ago when her husband Andr\u00e9s died. She now lives in her own house with her beloved son Henry in the town of Huayounioc. With a lot of efforts Marcelina was able to open a small caf\u00e9 in the town of Huayounioc, and with the help of her deceased husband she was able to fit it very well, little by little transforming it in a very well-known and popular place. The food she serves is very good, and for this reason her caf\u00e9 is attended by many customers. She sells coffee, panqueques (a sort of pancake maD. with flour) and drinks, which she sells mainly at night. Keeping her shop clean is what she loves the most about her job. She has been running this activity for 10 years and she thinks the most difficult part is to serve many people at the same time, as sometime she finds it hard to keep up with it. She also said she engages in breeding cows and small animals such as sheep, then selling their meat and milk. Every morning she goes to town to buy the manure they need, and being a good country woman she also engages in growing potatoes, maize and carrots on a small scale, as she has not so much time to dedicate to this because of her many activities. In the future she wishes to be able to save enough to lead a peaceful life in her old age. She is a member of the Banco Comunal \u201cProgreso Huayounioc\u201d (\u201cHuayounioc Progress\u201d Communal Bank), and this is the sixth loan she has requested to MFP.
