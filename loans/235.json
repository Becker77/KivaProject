She has three children: her elder daughter is nineteen, her elder son is sixteen and her younger daughter is twelve. Her elder daughter studies at the institution of higher education and her son and younger daughter go to school. Her husband is carpenter. Elmira sells honey. It was suggested by her aunt that she start selling honey in order to increase her income. Twenty years ago, Elmira bought honey and all necessary business supplies for 8,000 KGS and she earns about $195 monthly. She applied for a loan to buy a 200 liter kettle for the honey-making process. With the profits from selling honey, she plans to give her son a higher education and buy furniture for her house.\r\n\r\nGroup members:\r\n\r\nMarvarhan K. is the treasurer of the group. She is forty two and a widow. She has four children: her daughters are fifteen, thirteen and six and her son is ten years old. Her elder daughters and her son go to school and her youngest daughter is at home. Five years ago, Marvarhan received a loan from the micro-finance company \u201cFINCA\u201d in the amount of 5,000 KGS and bought honey. Then she resold that honey at a higher price. Now she gets about $175 monthly from selling honey. In order to increase her turnover she is applying for a loan because she doesn\u2019t have enough funds. \r\n\r\nSonaiym C. is forty-seven and married. She has four children: her daughters are twenty-three, twenty-one, and eighteen and her son is fourteen. Her elder daughter is a recent graduate and now is in search of employment opportunities. Her second and third daughters study at an institution of higher education, and her son goes to school. Her husband is a taxi driver. Nineteen years ago, Sonaiym was selling clothes when her friend suggested she switch to selling convenience goods. She bought some convenience goods for 30,000 KGS and started selling them. Now, she makes about $320 monthly. She has been able to buy an area already planted in a crop and to give her children an opportunity to study at the institution of higher education on the profits from her business. She is applying for a loan in order to get necessary funds for increasing the assortment of goods she sells. In the future, she plans to expand her business and buy a shop for her convenience goods. \r\n\r\nAizada A. is twenty-two and married. She has two sons: the elder is one year old and her younger son is eight months. Her husband is a computer administrator in a computer club. Aizada sells convenience goods at the local market or from home. In 2009, her neighbor offered her the chance to help in selling convenience goods, and then start selling on her own. She started with a purchase of goods for 25,000 KGS. Now she gets about $195 a month as an income from selling convenience goods. She is planning to increase the assortment but she doesn\u2019t have sufficient funds; therefore, she is applying for a loan. In the future, she is planning to build a shop near her house. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\n This loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

The mother of eight children confirms that she has had problems restocking her business, as the stock available is not satisfying customers' demand.\r\n\r\nShe uses loans to help her buy more goods to resell at a profit, with the hope of earning more income, catering for her family's needs, and thus improving her standard of living. This time round, she wants to clear her children's school dues. She belongs to Kibalinga Kyosimba onanya group with other members who hold each other accountable for paying back the loan.\r\n\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3550,"image":{"id":627896,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Paying her children's school fees","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Mubende","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.5 31.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-11-01T22:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3550,"lender_count":103,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aisha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Steven","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gertrude","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Specioza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Deziranta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Kyahurwa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Expedito","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nyansio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Muhamud","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Godfrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacob","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Living","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elnest","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":8100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1350000},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1350000},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1350000},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1350000},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1350000},{"due_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1350000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":591.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":591.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":591.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":591.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":591.66},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":591.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":591.67,"local_amount":1350000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1350479.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605958},{"amount":591.66,"local_amount":1350000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:24:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1350479.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188745005},{"amount":591.67,"local_amount":1350000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:07:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1350479.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191483136},{"amount":650.1,"local_amount":1483334,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:59:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1483860.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195909799},{"amount":606.28,"local_amount":1383332,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1383823,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201352288},{"amount":518.62,"local_amount":1183334,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:44:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1183754.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206218797}],"funded_date":"2010-11-21T07:43:10Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:44:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aya Padr\u00f3n","image":275073}},{"id":247467,"name":"Mary Adjoa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Adjoa A. is into the sale of plastic bowls in Abrafoa near Abura.

She lives with her husband who is supportive of her.  The house that they live in is theirs.  For four years she has been selling food (chicken soup) in a space that her children set up for her outside of their house.  She only sells her dish in the morning because it is in high demand during the early hours of the day because of its restorative properties.  The thing she likes most about her work is that many people savor the good flavor of her food.  Giving her customers a good product is very important for Zarela, since this determines whether customers return to her business.

This is the first time that she will have a loan with MFP and she is very excited to work with her community bank and to be very responsible in her repayments. The money she is requesting is for the purchase of an electronic scale to provide better service and more exact weight of the products she sells in bulk.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

The majority of the members are in the business of preparing meals for sale like chicken and special traditional dishes.  The rest of them sell CDs, provide in-home photography and videography services for special occasions, and some sell school and carpentry supplies.  All of these lines of work have heavy competition but the members have established solid reputations over the years selling dishes that people recognize and with the high quality of their ingredients.  The financing will be used to buy new supplies and work tools so that their work can be done faster and profits may be higher for the better well-being of their families.

Married to Prudencio C., who is retired, they are blessed with four children who are living their lives independently. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life. She has been selling newspapers for seven years.\r\n<p>\r\nCatalina has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than ten years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she has been able to borrow from CCT\u2019s cooperative seven times. She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed as additional capital for her business. Her business makes a profit of PHP 15,000 per month.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith your help, she would now like to apply for a PHP 15,000 loan.

Akoth. They have three children: Bridget, 8 years old, Cambeline, 6 years old, and Scoria, 4 years old. \r\n\r\nPeter owns a motorcycle which he uses in his business to transport people from Nyalenda to Kisumu town.

Nacaome is one of th hottest places in Honduras and people prefer to be comfortable with sandals..<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":584129,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy clothing and sandals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"San Lorenzo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.416667 -87.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":118,"posted_date":"2010-08-17T13:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lourdes Jeaneth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:36:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172173204},{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:58:17Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177469229},{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:32:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182607254},{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-19T10:20:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":189188980},{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:26:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191484366},{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T09:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195911162},{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:04:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201353606},{"amount":55,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:45:53Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206220168},{"amount":110,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:56:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2078.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211295346}],"funded_date":"2010-08-17T16:58:21Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:56:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":226987,"name":"Rosie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosie G. is from the town of Bunawan.

He doesn't have a house of his own because he lives with his father; it is on loan to him. Eusebio's wife gets along very well with her in-laws and she is very hard working. She is a housewife but she also works as a merchant selling undergarments for ladies and gentlemen in a plaza in San Felipe del Progreso. \r\n\r\nEusebio is a construction worker. He completed high school, and even though he is young there is no work for him. The only thing he was able to take up is construction, which is a trade that doesn't require training, but it is difficult work.  He only works when there is a contract for a house, a store, or a building in the Mexico City. \r\n\r\nEusebio has also been a merchant for many years. He sets out together with his wife to work on Sundays at the plaza in San Felipe del Progreso.  His wife sets up in one side selling undergarments and Eusebio sells shoes, and shoe care products, such as polish, brushes, dyes, as well as blenders. He also repairs blenders. \r\n\r\nThe difficult part about Eusebio's business is to keep his products away from the sun. If they are left in the sun the polishes expand or melt and the products won't sell. \r\n\r\nEusebio wants a better life for his family and a better education for his son. For this reason he wants to reach his goal of having his own merchandise. The greatest part of his merchandise is purchased with borrowed money.

Se caracteriza por la actividad agr\u00edcola, ganadera y artesana.\n\nJos\u00e9 se dedica a brindar servicio de transporte de carga de Tambogrande a Piura y viceversa, una zona donde predomina la agricultura. Para realizar su actividad cuenta con un cami\u00f3n, el cuales propio y sus principales clientes son los pobladores de la zona donde vive.

He owns the home where he lives with his wife and children.  His home has water and electricity and is located in the urban area of the Tambogrande District in the department of Piura.  He is known for his work in farming, ranching, and craftsmanship.\r\n\r\nFor a living, Jos\u00e9 transports cargo from Tambogrande to Piura and vice versa.  This area is mainly used for agriculture.  In order to do his work, he relies on his truck, which he owns.  His main customers are the people who live in his neighborhood.

She'll rush right out and invest this loan in yarn and embroidery thread. This is her first loan of her life, and having a bit of capital to buy the raw materials will be an amazing experience. \r\n<p>\r\nMatilde is married and has a little 9-month-old. Right now she and her husband rent a plot of about 20 by 40 meters to grow the corn that they use as their primary food, but she dreams of actually buying a plot of her own, which would cost as much as $1000. And someday she dreams of  constructing a house too. \r\n<p>\r\nMatilde, like several other women in her village, reports that the children under age 2 are very regularly sick, with fevers, headaches, and stomach aches.

Mahmadsaid started by selling a small number of products but now he has an extensive stock and has enlarged the store to take up the whole front of his home. His children have helped out; his family unit has been  instrumental in developing and growing his business.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is 41 years old and the mother of two small children who have depended on her since her husband abandoned her.  She has learned to be a single mother with a desire to come out ahead by being responsible, dynamic, and active.\r\n\r\nIt all began six years ago, when Yobana felt the need to start her own business, independent from that of her, then, husband.  This is when she learned of EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD.  Thanks to the loan she received, she was able to start her own business selling cylinders of gas for cooking, which she transported and delivered.  This is not a job that can be done by just ANY woman.\r\n\r\nYobana then requested additional loans through EDAPROSPO-PROSPERIDAD, which allowed her to open another one of her businesses.  Little by little she opened a small grocery shop in her home, which she runs with the help of her children.\r\n\r\nAnother one of her business, which she calls a hobby, is teaching girls to play volleyball.  She is very passionate about this sport and rarely misses the opportunity to play on the weekends.\r\n\r\nShe also sells Esika beauty products, which she promotes within her other businesses; to her gas customers, to her neighbors from her grocery shop, and to her fellow volleyball players.\r\n\r\nYobana has gotten a lot from her efforts, like being able to pay for her children\u2019s education, having her own shop in her home, and being able to give her children all that she could give them with all her heart.  One of her dreams is to have a large store where she can sell anything she thinks of.  She will not fail because she will give her all to get what she desires.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":491291,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Provide working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Juan de Lurigancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-02-20T16:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maribel Yobana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":67.95},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":63.68},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":73.47},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":72.91},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":77.41},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":79.91},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":83.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":87.52},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":92.19},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":96.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":100.36},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":104.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.48},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.88},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.55},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.03},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.97},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.82},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.57},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.12},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.64},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25.5,"local_amount":68,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":72.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933818},{"amount":24,"local_amount":64,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":68.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661411},{"amount":27.75,"local_amount":74,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:09Z","rounded_local_amount":78.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694071},{"amount":27.38,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":77.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151877035},{"amount":28.88,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:49:52Z","rounded_local_amount":82.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159617017},{"amount":30,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:00:41Z","rounded_local_amount":85.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166831389},{"amount":31.1,"local_amount":82.95,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:55:50Z","rounded_local_amount":88.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172097997},{"amount":33.02,"local_amount":88.05,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":93.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177390701},{"amount":34.5,"local_amount":92,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":98.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182529007},{"amount":35.99,"local_amount":95.99,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:52:09Z","rounded_local_amount":102.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188665156},{"amount":37.88,"local_amount":101.01,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":107.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191408482},{"amount":39,"local_amount":104,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:36:13Z","rounded_local_amount":111,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195826817}],"funded_date":"2010-02-20T17:38:37Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:36:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Edina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from ASKI. Edina is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in future. This will be the fifth loan taken out by Edina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

ventures: buying and selling livestock (pigs, goats, and cows) and operating a food vending business. She lives in the Sambag zone of Jonobjonob village, Escalante City, Negros Occidental. \n\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1999 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard at her livestock trading and food vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average income of PHP 4,000 per month.\n\nLenatte is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can buy more livestock. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Lenatte aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \n\nAbout NWTF:  \n\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":559651,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

She is 39 years old, married, and has four school-aged children. To make a living, she buys and sells dried fish and shrimp in the local community. Lina has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately $82 a month from this activity.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Lina joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Lina is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be her 3rd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

He makes and sells 'arroz de lisa' (a rice and fish dish).  This dish is a typical Barranquillera dish and is made with 'lisa', a sea fish which lays its eggs in brackish water such as river mouths.  Jos\u00e9 Alberto also sells 'bu\u00f1uelos' (a type of fritter), empanadas (stuffed pastries), 'deditos' (cheese fingers) and other delicacies that he prepares together with his wife and then transports on his three-wheeled vehicle which he acquired with his first loan from our foundation.  Thanks to our organization, Jos\u00e9 Alberto has managed to grow in his business and gradually fill his display case, his cooking pots and his soft drinks cooler.\r\n\r\nJos\u00e9 Alberto's main customers are neighbors in his own community where he has a captive market as he is located in a bus and mototaxi station and this is where his main customers are found.  Jos\u00e9 Alberto started this business two years ago after changing his business activity.  He used to hand-make and sell ladies' footwear but that business had a long production process and he made minimal profits.  For this reason, when he decided to join our foundation, he took advantage of the situation and changed his business to something which he knew and which was profitable.  Through his loans, he has managed to stabilize his business and he plans, in the future, to buy a cooler in which to keep his fish and meat.\r\n\r\nThis Kiva loan is Jos\u00e9 Alberto's third loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and he will use it to buy supplies such as rice, meat, cheese, flour and sugar wholesale.  His financial indicators show his accounts receivable turnover period at 1 day, his raw material turnover period at 2 days and his profits at 27%.  With this new investment, he plans to earn discounts by purchasing his supplies in larger quantities before new prices go into effect at the beginning of the year."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":699763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

It is a modest home that she shares with her 4 children and her long-term partner. Juliane has been living in the country for several years, ever since she emigrated to the Dominica. She is currently in receipt of her 8th loan with Esperanza (Kiva Field Partner).

Amina thanks you for your support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility.  Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral.  As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services.  Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania.  Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction.  More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her.  One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":287743,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Her principal economic activity is agriculturally-based; in spite of her short 7 years of experience, her lettuce, pea and corn crops are the best in the region.  \"It is paramount when taking care of the plantings to dedicate time to them\", she says.  For that reason in each field her crops already have buyers.  The wholesalers visit her farm lands to see the growth of their plantings, and to take away the whole harvest.  Since she has to market through middlemen, she is getting together money to be able to buy a truck, so that she can market her own products herself. \r\n\r\nShe is part of the village bank \"Paraiso al progreso\" and this is her third credit with MFP, where she is punctual and responsible with the payments they make to the association.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed noncreditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":287767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase soft drinks and poultry feed in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-15T23:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eddah I.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:15Z","rounded_local_amount":150383.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027619},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:56Z","rounded_local_amount":150383.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613620},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:04:08Z","rounded_local_amount":150383.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010699},{"amount":116.68,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":150383.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232985},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:39Z","rounded_local_amount":150383.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664776},{"amount":116.65,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:52Z","rounded_local_amount":150383.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105488}],"funded_date":"2009-03-16T07:38:48Z","paid_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Gina Kessler","image":null}},{"id":99176,"name":"Eva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eva D. is thirty two years old, married and the mother of two children.

The couple takes care of the family responsibilities together.\r\n\r\nIn order to take care of the diverse household responsibilities, Albertine has been selling plastics and fabric by the distribution system for about ten years. At the same time, Albertine sells shoes. Albertine gets her supplies in a market of B\u00e9nin. \r\n\r\nIn seeking to satisfy her customers and to grow her turnover and her income, Albertine is requesting a fourth loan from ALID\u00e9 together with the other members of the Mahudjro group. The first three loans were well repaid."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":957069,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy plastics, fabric and shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2011-12-23T03:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Albertine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marie","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":510000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":51000},{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":51000},{"due_date":"2012-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":51000},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":51000},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":51000},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":51000},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":51000},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":51000},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":51000},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":51000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":51000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:23:36Z","rounded_local_amount":51543.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257112586},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":51000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":51543.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263237702},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":51000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:18:30Z","rounded_local_amount":51543.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269962318},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":51000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:37:14Z","rounded_local_amount":51543.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276569751},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":51000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T09:12:39Z","rounded_local_amount":51543.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283059819},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":51000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:14:09Z","rounded_local_amount":51543.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287417754},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":51000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:43:10Z","rounded_local_amount":51543.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294272991},{"amount":36.18,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T08:56:13Z","rounded_local_amount":18191.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301326018},{"amount":205,"local_amount":102000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T08:56:06Z","rounded_local_amount":103086.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308083120},{"amount":66.32,"local_amount":33000,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-15T11:07:16Z","rounded_local_amount":33351.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315317546}],"funded_date":"2011-12-30T00:35:38Z","paid_date":"2012-11-15T11:07:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"S Mason","image":null}},{"id":378689,"name":"Asha","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asha, 23 years old, is married and has one child.

She owns a business venture, running bingo games.  Evelini has many years of experience in this business.  Evelini needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase game prizes.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 650 tala or US $271 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nEvelini joined SPBD.This is her 4th loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Evelini's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Evelini S. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u1ecb (20203050001) is a 53-year-old female living in the town of Y\u00ean Phong - B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has three adult children.  To make a living, T. operates a family member's business raising cattle for sale.  T. has been engaged in this business for over 12 years and earns approximately 5,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2009, T. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  T. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,152,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future.  T. is now requesting a new loan of 7,840,000, which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies.  The loan will be the second loan taken out by T. from SEDA.  T. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nT.

This previous loan was used to purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. \r\n\r\nPresentacion is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her 5th loan from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":700022,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to invest in expanding the business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bobongan, Ramon Magsaysay, Zamboanga del Sur","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2011-02-11T14:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Presentacion","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0.02}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:45:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1447.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195851183},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:11:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1447.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201293433},{"amount":33.33,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1447.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206162140},{"amount":93.53,"local_amount":3741.01,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:23:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4062.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211235201},{"amount":6.47,"local_amount":259,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":281.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216514059}],"funded_date":"2011-02-11T17:38:49Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:13:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":276224,"name":"Jenny Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Jenny Elizabeth, ella tiene 45 a\u00f1os, tiene 1 hijo menor de edad.
