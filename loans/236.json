and, as a result, both sell more shoes and make more money.

This is 36-year-old Lusia M. from Mbeya. She is widow with three children, who are between the ages of 9 and 14. She is also responsible for supporting two dependents because their parents are unable to care of them. Lusia has been running a crops-selling business since 1995. She purchases crops at wholesale prices and sells at retail to get more profit. She works at the business for twelve hours a day, six days a week. Lusia currently earns monthly profit of about $104 from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase more crops in bulk. In the future, she plans to open the same business at another location. Lusia thanks you for your support!\n\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and the couple is blessed with three children, all under 15 years old.  She lives in a small house with three rooms with her family on Foncha Street, in a quarter in Bamenda, in the northwest region of Cameroon.\r\n\r\nR. has faced some challenges in life: the inability to meet the basic necessities of her family -- like clothing, food, and transportation, the inability to educate herself and her children, and difficulties in raising capital to start up a small business.   \r\n\r\nTo sustain herself and her family, she plans to invest this loan into a phone booth business.  With this loan she is going to buy two phones and transfer the credit and related bonus in the two phones which she sells to her customers. She believes the business will succeed because the previous loan she took was repaid by the income raised from an old phone of hers.  Therefore, she concludes that she is sure the business will succeed. She is certain that this business will succeed because the services she renders are in high demand in the market. The loan will help her community because they will be able to afford food ingredients.\r\n\r\nR. will plough part of the profit back into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to pay her children\u2019s school fees and cater for the family. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the low cost in obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE:\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

The fact that he is an optimist and a hard worker, in a broad sense, helps his cause a great deal.\r\n\r\nChampkin restocks his business with an array of general merchandise retail commodities on a weekly basis. Demand for the commodities he keeps repurchasing is high, yet at times he always runs short of the most basic of commodities like soap and sugar. The fact that his shop is doing great business is a good indicator of a great future in business. His shop appeals to most rank-and-file people in his village.\r\n\r\nThis is the third time that Champkin's group is taking a loan from Pearl microfinance and their track record in repaying their loans, despite some setbacks, has been up to the mark. Weekly, this business's sales returns total up to 150,000 shillings.\r\n\r\nChampkin says he is requesting this Kiva loan to purchase more retail commodities such as sugar, salt, toothpaste, cooking oil, maize flour, beans, rice, plastic cups, etc. to resell."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":813577,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more retail commodities such as sugar, salt, toothpaste, cooking oil, maize flour, beans, rice, plastic cups, etc. to resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kayunga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 32.866667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-07-17T12:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2625,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Champkin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hamis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Muzamiru","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isa","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zaituni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zaid","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julius","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isaac","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hamuza","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Margret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nathan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nason","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":6750000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":2625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1125000},{"due_date":"2011-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1125000},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1125000},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1125000},{"due_date":"2011-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1125000},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":437.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":272.81,"local_amount":701500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":705202.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227248981},{"amount":1039.69,"local_amount":2673500,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T09:31:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2687611.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868551},{"amount":379.2,"local_amount":975083,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-06T09:22:26Z","rounded_local_amount":980229.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648385},{"amount":372.24,"local_amount":957184,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":962236.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251313746},{"amount":556.63,"local_amount":1431333,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-02T09:19:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1438888.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275373},{"amount":4.43,"local_amount":11400,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-28T08:05:17Z","rounded_local_amount":11460.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264223720}],"funded_date":"2011-07-19T22:10:57Z","paid_date":"2012-04-28T08:05:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":320933,"name":"Sawsan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sawsan is a 30-year-old Lebanese married woman living with her husband and four school-aged children.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, Protus will educate his children and invest in livestock.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Furaha B group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nHe is pictured with his group members in the photograph."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":898883,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-09T02:30:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Protus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agatha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emmanuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rabecca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":61950,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61950}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":61950,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:25Z","rounded_local_amount":63960,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680586}],"funded_date":"2011-11-28T18:23:58Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:15:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":357849,"name":"Monica","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la se\u00f1ora M\u00f3nica se dedica a la venta de comida, es hermana de una cliente antigua de la agencia, su hermana es muy puntual y responsable, la se\u00f1ora M\u00f3nica siempre fue garante pero ahora se decidi\u00f3 a sacar un cr\u00e9dito, la se\u00f1ora M\u00f3nica se dedica a la venta de comida en un anaquel hace ya varios a\u00f1os, su puesto esta ubicado en la zona Tejada Sorsano, su puesto esta alquilado y la se\u00f1ora quiere agarrar el puesto en anticr\u00e9tico por este motivo solicito el cr\u00e9dito para el anticr\u00e9tico de su puesto de venta, su deseo es poder alg\u00fan d\u00eda comprarse ese puesto de venta,  la se\u00f1ora tiene una hija que tiene 17 a\u00f1os ella esta estudiando en colegio, la se\u00f1ora esta actualmente separada, sola saca adelante a su hija y se siente feliz por la oportunidad que se le brindo en la otorgaci\u00f3n del cr\u00e9dito.\t","en":"\r\nM\u00f3nica sells food.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

","en":"Francisco is 41 years old, is a very responsible woman, and lives with the father of her 6 children, of whom the 2 oldest live in Lima and the younger ones live with her in her own house (for which she doesn\u2019t have the deed). The majority of her harvest is the potato because it is very profitable, but it is also very costly because she has to invest in chemical fertilizers. As a result, it takes up all of her time. When she is in her fields, she first thoroughly considers her plants with the goal of detecting the problems that could affect her crops. She tries to resist the problems by using pesticides. She sells her products in a very large and busy market in the city of Tarma called \u201cThe Wholesale\u201d (\u201cEl Mayorista\u201d). Most of her sales leave her with very good earnings, with which she educates her children and takes care of the family\u2019s expenses. Francisca works well with her husband and does not get tired of it. She is very happy with MFP; this is her fifth loan and during the 4 previous cycles, she showed that she is a very responsible client. She is also very involved in the responsibilities of her community bank, to which she is very thankful. She plans to invest the money requested in the purchase of chemical fertilizers for her potato crops.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":365169,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-07T18:30:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1025}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1025,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3023.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123985}],"funded_date":"2009-08-08T21:43:41Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":131627,"name":"Lucrecia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucrecia P., at age 53, is a tireless entrepreneur.

He is 57; married; and the father of 5 children who are 28, 26, 23, 19, and 15.  His 3 oldest children go to school.  He studied for one year at the Industrial Institute and didn't continue due to the lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home with his family in the Lu\u00eds Cabral neighborhood and also supports his grandson and nephew who live with him.  He has never moved to another home.  He is a merchant and owner of his own business and has also worked at SEMOC (which stands for Seeds of Mozambique) as the head of human resources for 9 years.  At the company where he works, he earns a monthly salary of 9,750 meticais and at his business, he earns 3,000 meticais per week.  He saves some of it in his bank account.  He sells meat, flour, beverages, and other items.  He has had loans with another credit organization known as TCHUMA and later became familiar with Hluvuku through his colleagues, so he decided to request his first loan.  This is his 2nd loan with Hluvuku.  His previous loan was for 15,000 meticais and was used for the same purpose.  In the future he hopes to request more loans to be able to expand his business, which he plans to do by raising chickens to butcher.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":434060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy and sell drinks, meat, and soft drinks","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-11-25T23:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.11,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Firmino Afonso","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1098.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1148.22},{"due_date":"2010-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1200.13},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1254.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1311.09},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1370.36},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1432.3},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1497.05},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1564.73},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1635.46},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1709.39},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1786.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1867.43},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1951.85},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2040.09},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2132.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.19},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.91},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.88},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.97},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.13},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.39},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.77},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.24},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.53},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":65.36},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.32},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.4},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":68.51,"local_amount":1957.53,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2006.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110709085},{"amount":10.13,"local_amount":289.25,"processed_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-19T08:48:57Z","rounded_local_amount":296.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118101638},{"amount":53.54,"local_amount":1529.68,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-19T07:44:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1568.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938215},{"amount":71,"local_amount":2028.54,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-23T07:46:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2079.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938216},{"amount":74.71,"local_amount":2137.74,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2191.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.11,"payment_id":128972070},{"amount":597,"local_amount":17057.26,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-17T07:40:39Z","rounded_local_amount":17486.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916098}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T01:25:33Z","paid_date":"2010-08-17T07:40:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":160517,"name":"Julife","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julife G. is from the village of Migpange Bonifacio, Misamis Occ.

The great majority of the partners own commercial businesses, in food sales, empanadas, groceries, clothing, and public transportation. For example, the president earns a living by making and distributing bread. He starts working at 3:00 in the morning, since he only has one delivery vehicle and must wake up early to make the bread and manage to distribute it to all of the stores with which he has set contracts. The best way to make your clients loyal is to make sure your products never fail. Mr. Erik Mauricio has four small children whom he must support, and he is helped by his wife, who sells pastries at the entrance of the bakery to help with the domestic expensese. In the market, there exists an ample amount of bakers, therefore the competition is high, but the president states that bread is never lacking at home if one always works hard to get ahead. The rest of the members also have a lot of competition, but they try to get ahead in life with effort, work, and appreciation for the experience that they have. This loan will be used for the purchase of supplies. For example, in the case of the president it will be used for buying flour and industrial gas cylinders, so that it is less difficult to carry and change the cylinders at any moment, since his zone does not have domestic gas through tubing. Also, this will prevent the scarcity of gas cylinders. The rest of the members desire to expand their businesses with more merchandise, supplies, and materials. Mrs. Nilda, who makes a living selling food, insists in expanding and modernizing her business so that it is more attractive for her clients that frequent it. Mrs. Walter wishes to paint her vehicle, since it is her source of income and with the age of her car, a new coat of paint is necessary.

She started these businesses only when ASHI gave her an opportunity to obtain a loan.

The proceeds of her business give her money to support the immediate and basic needs of her family. \r\n\r\nIsabelita hopes that her business will become successful someday. She still dreams of having a durable and concrete house of her own and to save for her family\u2019s future.\r\n\r\nIsabelita wants to thank ASHI and Kiva lenders who are sponsoring this loan. That is one of the greatest opportunities for her to start reaching for her goals.\r\n\r\nAbout ASHI: Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) has the distinction of being the oldest existing replication of Grameen Bank Approach (GBA) to credit delivery to the bottom poor in the Philippines.

She raises them both for their offspring and for slaughter. In addition, she also assists her husband in the cultivation of crops from her own farmland. The couple has a child who is already married and lives at home. San N. has raised a lot of piglets and she had hoped to sell them to buyers four months after she began raising them. Unfortunately, the pigs are not big enough, due to the lack of food.

year old. She is married to Rolando, a fisherman, and they were blessed with three children whose ages are 17, 9 and 8, a high school student and two elementary students.\r\n\r\nIt was the year 2004 when she became a member of Ahon sa Hirap, Inc. a partner micro-finance institution of KIVA in the Philippines. She is one of the good performing members of ASHI. Though she is active, she only borrows capital that she thinks she can regularly repay.  The family income is only enough for their daily needs and school expenses for their children. \r\n\r\nAfter seven long years she has gained confidence and is now applying for a loan of 17,000 PHP to buy additional fishing gear, nets and a canoe or wooden boat for her husband to use. She will also buy additional piglets for her hog raising business. Fishing and hog raising have been their primary sources of income for the past seven years, and they have really benefited from it. Their future plan is to develop these businesses more and make them stable so as to be able to sustain the education of their children. They also plan to renovate their current house and buy additional appliances.\r\n\r\nJocelyn is so glad that she became a member of ASHI and KIVA because their life has improved since then and their dream is now at hand. She hopes and prays that the two institutions will continue to support her goals for herself and her family.

Su negocio no tiene nombre porque realiza las ventas de forma ambulante, visita las casas de sus vecinos para ense\u00f1arles la mercaderia y si les gusta y no tienen dinero para pagarle inmediatamente se las deja al credito. Su horario para realizar las ventas es de lunes a viernes por las tardes y asi le queda tiempo para atender los quehaceres de su hogar pero los fines de semana sale desde muy temprano, aunque su mayor dificultad es cuando llueve no puede salir de su casa.

She sells undergarments while her husband is a small-scale farmer, growing corn and beans.  They have three children, which includes two daughters.  Yajaira is a determined individual who was born in the neighborhood of San Nicolas.  She started selling undergarments with a little bit of money that she had saved because she needed to help her husband with the household expenses since the cost of food keeps increasing each day.  Her business does not have a formal name because she sells as a traveling vendor.  She visits the homes of her neighbors so that she can show them the merchandise.  If they like the products and do not have money to pay immediately, then Yajaira will extend credit to her customers.  Her schedule for making sales is from Monday through Friday in the afternoons.  This gives her time to take care of the household chores, but on the weekends she leaves very early.  Her greatest difficulty is when it rains because she is not able to leave the house.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe loan Yajaira is requesting will be used to buy bras, bloomers, bikinis, boxers, and other items.  With the support of this loan, she will able to move forward with her business.  This enables her to generate income so that she can help her husband and children.

The family prepares and sells it to the community and in other localities. \r\n\r\nErlinda is a member of Ahon sa Hirap, Inc. a partner micro-finance institution of KIVA in the Philippines since 2000. She\u2019s been a very dedicated and active member of the institution. She joined ASHI to have access to capital to develop their food production business. She is applying for another loan of Php 25,000 to finance this business. The demand for their products starting this month is high that is why she needs more capital to buy raw materials for the production and additional aluminum basins for their vendors to use. Her dream is to construct an appropriate preparation area and increase their production. She believes that her business can also provide employment in their community and not just sustain their family needs.  She hopes that ASHI and KIVA will support her in these aspirations.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":599594,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Her husband Juan is 32 years old and he is tailor.  Together they work hard every day to make ends meet. For the past year, this enterprising woman has been selling clothing. Her business is conducted in the following way: clothing is purchased in wholesale at a large shopping district in the city and buys merchandise to fill orders placed by clients in her community. She is very happy with her work because she doesn't have a fixed schedule which is very useful while raising her children. She is also able to sell some of the clothing items that her husband makes in his shop.  She doesn't appreciate it when orders placed are then rejected by the clients, forcing her to sell to other persons. But despite the difficulties she is able to progress in her business. She is en enterprising person and in the future she wants to have her own store in order to improve her earnings. This is her first loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she is committed to making her payments on time. She does not want to cause hardship for the other members of the team especially because it is through them that she is able to continue her business.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJasmine is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Jasmine owns and operates a business venture in the food sector.  The income for her business comes primarily from selling seafood such as fish and shrimp in the local community.

She is 51 years old, married, and has five adult-aged children. To make a living, Shirly owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling canned goods, snack foods, detergents, instant noodles, shampoo, soap, and beverages in the local community. Shirly has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Shirly joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Shirly has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to to purchase additional inventory and acquire working capital. Shirly is requesting a new loan of 17,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional canned goods, detergents, and  beverages. This loan will be Shirly's fifth loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

is a single mother. She lives with her two children, who are students in a small education center in their city. She decided to begin her business work outside her own home. Noticing the business opportunity offered by the location in front of the health clinic, she did not hesitate in moving her food sales to that space. In little time she was sought by a large number of people who daily go to the health clinic to receive medical attention to alleviate their problems. The delicious dishes she prepares and sells since very early in the day have become a favorite of many of the people who visit that place until the afternoon. This drove her to buy a tent to protect herself from the hot sun and also to offer comfort to her clients. In addition, she can count with the support of her children in giving attention to her clients in the busiest times. She requests US$ 350 to buy a new tent, kitchen utensils and products to prepare her dishes, which will allow her to increase the quantity and variety of dishes she offers daily. Let's make it possible for this hardworking mother to continue cooking her excellent dishes and decorating each one of them with her family's dreams.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Eliana Colunga, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica es madre soltera, vive con sus dos hijos, los cuales est\u00e1n cursando estudios en un peque\u00f1o centro educativo de su ciudad.Decidi\u00f3 empezar su labor comercializadora  en las afueras de su hogar y observando la oportunidad de negocio que se presentaba en el frontis de la posta de salud no dud\u00f3 en trasladar su espacio de ventas hasta este espacio.En poco tiempo  tuvo acogida del inmenso n\u00famero de personas que acude a diario para recibir distintas atenciones con el prop\u00f3sito de contrarrestar sus males.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It also has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's history<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The family lives in Gilside, Brgy. Nabulao, Sipalay City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nFlorenda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she aspired toward something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Florenda has been working hard and incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 6,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, which helped to improve the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 14th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000, which she intends to use to purchase an expanded inventory for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Florenda Ca\u00f1ete is truly a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

She lives in Toledo City, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 2,900. Laurita is borrowing PHP 10,000 to fund the operations of her business. This will be her 20th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Laurita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Her dream is to be able to expand her business (to buy counters and a freezer, among other things). From talking to her customers, she has also realized that it would be a good idea to start selling clothing.

The eldest is attending senior high school, while the younger one is in elementary school. Her husband, Salim, does not have a fixed job, so he does odd jobs, carrying goods and off-loading trucks when he can.\r\n\r\nR. buys waste material like plastic cups, plastic bottles, cardboard and paper from her neighbors and other houses in the village. Her husband uses a cart to collect scrap metal and other waste material. Households do not just give away waste material, because there is demand and therefore economic value in recycling. So the more working capital they have, the more scrap they can collect and recycle. Their own working capital is limited, at around $250. Having heard from her friends about MBK, R. has now applied to MBK to add to her working capital. Since this is the first time, R. can only borrow a maximum of $75 from MBK.\r\n\r\nThe recycling business consists of the following chain. R. and her husband are the first link in this chair, buying waste and scrap materials from households, sorting and cleaning them, before selling them to an intermediate dealer. This dealer comes around in a small truck, collects the sorted-out material and takes it to the warehouse dealer. There, the different materials are weighed in front of R.\u2019s husband, who then gets paid by the intermediate dealer. The warehouse dealer in turn sends the waste material to various processing factories, which turn produce clean and reusable recycled paper, cardboard and plastic recycled raw materials. Waste recycling undertaken by R. and her husband thus helps clean the environment by reusing waste material which otherwise would go to the landfills.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":75,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":75,"image":{"id":15707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase waste material","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Tangerang","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.178056 106.63","type":"point"}},"partner_id":43,"posted_date":"2007-02-15T08:01:54Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":75,"lender_count":3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosidah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-01T09:01:34Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":75,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":75,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":6.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":14,"local_amount":14,"processed_date":"2007-05-01T09:27:46Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14523},{"amount":7,"local_amount":7,"processed_date":"2007-06-01T09:18:38Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":19311},{"amount":7,"local_amount":7,"processed_date":"2007-07-01T09:20:15Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27958},{"amount":7,"local_amount":7,"processed_date":"2007-08-01T09:21:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":37755},{"amount":7,"local_amount":7,"processed_date":"2007-09-01T09:21:57Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":49156},{"amount":7,"local_amount":7,"processed_date":"2007-10-01T09:20:09Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":61361},{"amount":7,"local_amount":7,"processed_date":"2007-11-01T10:20:24Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":74760},{"amount":7,"local_amount":7,"processed_date":"2007-12-01T10:19:36Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":89451},{"amount":7,"local_amount":7,"processed_date":"2008-01-01T10:17:34Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":105907},{"amount":5,"local_amount":5,"processed_date":"2008-02-01T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-02T10:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":125770}],"funded_date":"2007-02-15T09:01:34Z","paid_date":"2008-02-01T10:18:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":8748,"name":"Aniva","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aniva is fifty-four years of age and has six children.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

Atoullo is a 29-year-old man who is married and has two children. Atoullo\u2019s goals are to grow in his personal life and in his business. His wish is to offer better service to his customers. His dream is that God continues to provide him with more life so that he can get ahead and fulfill his goals.\n\nHe is a taxi driver and travels the streets of Dushanbe City in search of customers. He has owned his business for two years. \n\nToday, Atoullo is planning to replace the fuel supply system of his taxi with one using liquified gas, as the gas is cheaper than petrol (gasoline). For this purpose he wants to borrow $800.\n\nHe sincerely thanks Kiva and all its lenders for making this help possible.  \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in her own house with her husband Miguel, who is 35 years old, and their daughter Elena, who is 8 years old. Basilia wants to give them a better life. The hard-working Basilia wakes up at 6 in the morning, when she opens her grocery store and prepares to begin selling her products. Her store is located in the neighborhood of La Rinconada, which is an important neighborhood in the city of Juliaca. She works at her grocery store all day, until 9 at night, when she closes the store, knowing that the next day will bring another long work-day. What she likes most about her business is talking with her clients; this makes the long days more pleasant. She has spent 4 years working in her business. What she likes least is having to spend all day in her store, even though she knows that her sacrifice is not in vain. In the near future, she hopes to have a larger store, where she can sell more varied products. This is her first loan with MFP, and she knows that she has to pay her installments on time. In her community bank, she is very happy and is always up to date with the agreements that exist among the members. With the 1000 soles that she is requesting, she will buy more products for her store and will be able to offer more items to her clients. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":355173,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase her merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-21T18:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Basilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:44:04Z","rounded_local_amount":175.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63212053},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:24:08Z","rounded_local_amount":175.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641588},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:37:02Z","rounded_local_amount":175.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081028},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:12:27Z","rounded_local_amount":175.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997178},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":175.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842522},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:44Z","rounded_local_amount":173.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734098}],"funded_date":"2009-07-21T21:12:07Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":127556,"name":"Celenia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Celenia, at the age of forty-six, is a woman full of dreams that remain unrealized due to unceasing hardships prevalent in the country.

She is 45 years old. Lyndie is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Lyndie owns and operates a business raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for sale. Lyndie has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Lyndie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lyndie is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional feed. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Lyndie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her general living conditions. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

R. is 36 years old and lives with his wife and two children in the neighborhood of Jos\u00e9 Dolores Estrada.  His children currently attend elementary school while his wife takes care of the housework.  Douglas has worked as a carpenter for seven years.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he started his carpentry apprenticeship, Douglas had the support of his family and bought basic tools to establish a small workshop.

Abduhalim is 31 years old, married and has three children. He is a farmer growing onions, corn, rice, and nuts--something he has done for 11 years. This is the only thing he knows how to do and what he likes most to do. For Abduhalim, there is nothing better than being in touch with nature and watching the crops he has planted grow year after year.\r\n\r\n In addition, Abduhalim raises cattle and his family helps him with his business. Now he wants to borrow money to purchase seeds and fertilizer for his crops. This is the second loan of Abduhalim from IMON International and he promises to repay the loan without any violations as he did with his previous loan. \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They have nine children who are between 32 and  47 years old. Ma. Luz joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1990 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 21 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Luz has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,400, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 22nd loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000 to purchase stock so that she can continue to save up for the future. Ma.

She learned how to bake from her parents who have an oven and made bread and cakes to sell. What she likes most about her job is decorating her cakes. She has a lot of patience to decorate and this can be seen in the beautiful designs she makes. She has been working in this business for 10 years and considers staying up late to finish orders to be the most difficult part. This will be her 10th loan with MFP. She has always been punctual with her payments and plans to do the same for these payments. In her communal bank she is a responsible member which is why she is well liked. With the three thousand Peruvian Soles loan she will buy new display cabinets to open her new bakery."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":794865,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy display cabinets to sell her cakes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":453.18},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":471.3},{"due_date":"2011-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":487.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":507.49},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":529.95},{"due_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":550.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.17},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.81},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.69},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.08},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":194.31},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":201.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":166.17,"local_amount":453.18,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":458.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550487},{"amount":172.81,"local_amount":471.3,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":477.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719174},{"amount":761.02,"local_amount":2075.52,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2101.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350637}],"funded_date":"2011-06-22T16:40:47Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Garza","image":688224}},{"id":312800,"name":"Gotitas De Amor Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Felipa es integrante D. la  Alcanc\u00eda Comunal \u201cGotitas D.

small-scale relief and rehabilitation project in 1972 to help the country overcome the devastation and trauma of the liberation war and focused on resettling refugees returning from India. Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education
