She is married with four school-aged children.  To make a living, Lona operates a family member's business raising crops.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes primarily from planting and harvesting bananas for sale.  Lona has been doing this for over six years and earns approximately 800 WST a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2004, Lona joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Lona has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers such as manure.  Lona is now requesting a new loan of 2200 WST which will be used to invest in expanding the business.  The loan will be her sixth loan from SPBD.  Lona plans to use the additional revenue generated to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n<p>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

anywhere else. He studied till 8th grade and then emigrated to neighboring south Africa to learn a living. There he learnt how to build and paint ceilings, although he has not done that any more in a long time.\r\n\r\nGilberto lives with his partner and has two children with her, aged 7 and 4. The eldest goes to school and the youngest will go soon. He also supports one sister of his who lives nearby.\r\n\r\nGilberto had been working for a while as a car painter till, in 2004, he opened a hairdresser's nearby which he now runs. He has a couple of employees and makes an income of about 500 meticals per day.\r\n\r\nGilberto is asking for a loan to start up a little grocery business within his property, at a stall next to his house that he shows in the photo and is about to finish.

single and mother of 2 children aged between 19 and 22. In her second last year of high school she lost parents and due to lack of support started a business selling smoked fish. She has a daily revenue of 30000 to 50000 and gets her supplies from the inland markets or from the riverside villages where fishing is the principal activity.  With the loan she hopes to receive, she will buy 5 baskets of Mboto (large carp). 10 baskets of brown bullheads (Ngolo) and 8 baskets of sea lamprey or eel (Nzombo), all heavily consumed fish in Congolese familiies.\r\n\r\nIn time, she has plans to expand and to open a large fish outlet, and have the riverside suppliers deliver their baskets of fish rather than her having to make the trip by canoe each week. The more she increases her stock, the greater her profits will be, enabling her to increase her savings and in turn provide for her family and put her children through tertiary level education.<br

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has been farming for 10 years and is well known for her farm work.  What she most likes about her business is caring for her crops as her household income depends on it.  She considers the most difficult part of her work to be transporting her produce from the farm to the city of San Francisco which is where she receives the best prices for her product.  In the future, Faustina would like to increase her crops, buying more cacao and coffee plants so that she can obtain good produce.\r\n\r\nThis will be Faustina's thirteenth loan from MFP and she pledges to make her repayments on time as she has in the past.  She gets on well with the other members of her community bank and they enjoy spending time together.  With the 2,000 soles that she has requested, Faustina will buy cacao and coffee plants so that she can increase her production."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":927885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cacao and coffee plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-24T02:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Faustina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:41Z","rounded_local_amount":2025.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294400798}],"funded_date":"2011-11-25T22:48:14Z","paid_date":"2012-08-15T10:11:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":366509,"name":"Moeun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Moeun is a 34-year-old widowed woman from Reussey Keo commune, a suburb area of Phnom Penh where she lives with her three children.

Working 7 days a week and 13 hours a day, he earns about Le 750,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000.\n\n Michael has already received and successfully repaid a loan and now requires a new loan in order to buy Novalgin tabs, Amoxicillin, Dexedrine and Paracetamol. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 400,000. In the future, Michael plans to establish a desk-top publishing center, to build a house and educate his children.   He thanks you for your support.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":948007,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy Paracetomal, Amoxicillin, Dexorange, and Novalgin.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Kenema","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2012-01-23T02:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Michael  M.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":500000},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":505250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257124825},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":505250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505732},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":505250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974836},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":505250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815402},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:04:44Z","rounded_local_amount":505250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444456},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":505250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537168},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:23Z","rounded_local_amount":505250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294284641},{"amount":117.5,"local_amount":500000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":505250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301338211},{"amount":235,"local_amount":1000000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1010500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308354614}],"funded_date":"2012-01-23T12:35:19Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":382898,"name":"Nguyen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nguyen, 54, is married and has two daughters.

They live in a rural area called Villa Reconciliacion.  The region is very poor and crime is a problem.   Silvia has fought on her own to provide for her children, making sure they have an education so that they will be able to pursue professions and improve their lives.   In order to meet all her obligations, she works selling clothing, perfumes and cosmetics to her friends and neighbors.  The income from this has enabled her to pay her household costs. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> Because of the cost of food and basic services, Silvia decided to fix up a small room in her house so that she could rent it out to a couple, increasing her income and doing her best to provide for  the needs of her children.  But the rains have been heavy the last few months, causing some damage to the room and the wooden walls and now the renters are asking that she fixes it.   She is requesting a loan to buy supplies to rebuild the walls from concrete.  This will allow her to offer a nicer room to the tenants, as well as collect more rent. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Silvia es madre soltera, tiene tres hijos de 13, 16 y 17 a\u00f1os, los cuales est\u00e1n estudiando, habitan en el asentamiento de Villa Reconciliaci\u00f3n,  zona rural, muy pobre, existe mucha delincuencia.

Para poder cumplir con todas las obligaciones, esta madre trabaja de operaria en una zona franca, oportunidad en la que ha aprovechado para comercializar ropa, perfumes y cosm\u00e9ticos a las trabajadores de esa maquila as\u00ed como a sus amistades y vecinas, ingresos que le han permitido pagar los gastos del hogar. \r\n\r\nDebido a lo costoso de los alimentos y servicios b\u00e1sicos, decide acondicionar un peque\u00f1o cuarto en su humilde vivienda con l\u00e1minas de zinc y madera, el cual alquila a una pareja, es con todo esto que esta madre hace frente a satisfacer las necesidades b\u00e1sicas de sus hijos, todo con el objetivo de brindarles un mejor nivel de vida a su familia.

He lives with his parents in the Ni\u00e9bala quarter of the town of Bougouni (the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Not having been to school, he very quickly started trying to make money, notably working every day with traders in the square. After gaining several years' experience of this, he decided to start buying and selling food items himself. His little shop is located in the large Bougouni market. Whilst looking for extra financial resources, he decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso's loan programme. This is his first time with the programme. With this loan he is planning to buy various food items. He buys his produce from wholesalers in Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali). His customers are members of the local population. With this loan, he hopes to earn a monthly profit of 67,000 FCFA which will be used to grow his business and cover family expenses.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Lara Francis, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":472235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy various food items to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-01-18T16:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohamed ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":37500},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":37500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":84.38,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-17T09:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":38522.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991340},{"amount":84.37,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:06Z","rounded_local_amount":38522.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021615},{"amount":84.38,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:15Z","rounded_local_amount":38522.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746405},{"amount":84.37,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:24Z","rounded_local_amount":38522.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778941},{"amount":84.38,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:34Z","rounded_local_amount":38522.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961153},{"amount":84.37,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:25Z","rounded_local_amount":38522.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699328},{"amount":84.38,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:04Z","rounded_local_amount":38522.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913272},{"amount":84.37,"local_amount":37500,"processed_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":38522.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180468}],"funded_date":"2010-01-18T18:13:57Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:40:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lara Francis","image":null}},{"id":173397,"name":"Beatice","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Beatice B. bakes bread for sale at Elmina.

She is 38 years old, single, and is the mother of 3 children. The older two are 19 and 14 years old, and the third is 9 months old. The older children go to school and live with their father. Lili studied up to 12th grade, but wasn't able to continue studying because she couldn't afford it. She lives in her own home with her youngest child, and doesn't support anyone else financially. \r\n\r\nShe moved from the city of Maputo to Matola in order to be close to her work. She has worked in the court system of Maputo for more than 3 years as an assistant. She has a set work schedule, from 7:30 AM to 3:30 PM. She also employs someone to help her with housework and to care for her youngest daughter. She receives a monthly salary of  2000.00 meticales as well as a variable work bonus that depends in part on the number of court cases being tried. She uses her earnings to cover household expenses and also saves some in her bank account. \r\n\r\nLili had taken out loans before with Banco Procredit, but later decided not to continue working with them. She heard about Hluvuku from neighbors of hers who had taken advantage of the services it provides. This is her first loan, in the amount of 10,000.00 meticales. She plans to use it to buy construction materials (iron, support beams, cement, sand and other items) to continue with her home improvement project. \r\n\r\nShe promises to repay this loan as agreed, in order to be eligible to take out others in the future. She would like to take out other loans in order to finish working on her house and then furnish it, in order to offer her family better living conditions.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

In the future she\u2019d like to have a store where she can sell larger amounts of shoes.\r\n\r\nThis is her 3rd loan with MFP.  She has no doubt that she will repay her loan installments on time because she has a lot of faith in her business.  She will use the requested 1000 new soles to buy more shoes to increase the amount she usually sells.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":774849,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to stock up on more shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-24T00:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raquel ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":152.01},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":158.52},{"due_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":163.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":169.15},{"due_date":"2011-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":176.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":180.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.45},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.22},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.43},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.05},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57,"local_amount":152.01,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:48Z","rounded_local_amount":156.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550354},{"amount":59.64,"local_amount":159.03,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":164.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719030},{"amount":61.03,"local_amount":162.74,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":168.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350497},{"amount":64.77,"local_amount":172.73,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:48Z","rounded_local_amount":178.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850979},{"amount":66.59,"local_amount":177.56,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:53Z","rounded_local_amount":183.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666141},{"amount":65.97,"local_amount":175.93,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":181.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836423}],"funded_date":"2011-05-24T02:21:24Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":305025,"name":"Salvacion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of four children, Salvacion works hard to support her family.

To make her aims come true she is asking for financial assistance in the amount of 10,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP).

You can find Cinthia at her stand in the Alameda Marina Aguilar from the afternoon until midnight.\r\n<\/p>\r\n<p> With this loan of 1000 Nuevo Sol ($350), which she will repay in four months, she will purchase supplies needed for the preparation of her food such as rice, sacks of sugar, gallons of oil, and large quantities of condiments in addition to daily purchases of beef, chicken, pork and fish which allows her to prepare many different dishes from the region to satisfy the tastes of her customers.  Erika is a young woman of 33 with three children.  She wants to provide them a better future and a good education.  She has a goal of having her own store front for her business.

This is 35-year-old Tamaly A. from Kyela. She is a widow with two children, ages 5 and 11. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one dependent orphan. Tamaly has been running a crops-selling business since 2006. She buys cocoa seeds and rice from farmers and sells them in the market at a higher price. \r\n<P>\r\nTamaly works at the business for 9 to 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Tamaly currently earns about 180 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase more cocoa and rice in bulk. In the future, she plans to establish another business. Tamaly thanks you for your support!\r\n<P>\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit through micro-leasing in Tanzania. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":237339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

Ortiz district.  This is five minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nIn April of this year she and her husband bought a used car.  They use it working in the sale and distribution of clothes.  They travel to Ecuador or to Lima two or three times a month to buy their merchandise and distribute it to the main establishments in the city.  Also, her husband works as a taxi driver in the car when they are not away from Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nThe continual use and the age of the vehicle have made it start to have mechanical problems with the motor.  That is why she has seen the need to ask our institution, for the first time, for a loan for 2,000 PEN.  She plans to use it for the repair and maintenance of their car.\r\n\r\nHer biggest goal is to save enough money to buy some land and build her own house.

She also takes care of her sister's children.  She owns a store in Kisaasi selling charcoal and sells to all categories of people at retail and at wholesale.  She wants to use this loan to buy more bags of charcoal.  Margaret doesn\u2019t incur any transport costs because she buys from her place of work. She has been in this business for five years. Besides this charcoal business, she also sells second hand clothes. Her major customers are her neighbors. She works seven days a week. Margaret's biggest challenges are seasonality and debtors.

She explains, \"My business is constant when my crops are fully grown, I have to cut them, bind them in small packets and sell them for 0.50 cents each.\"  She says that raising this type of vegetable is easier because it grows, is cut, and grows again without having to spend money on fertilizer or workers to plough and clear the land, etc.  Previously these were issues that one constantly had to worry about.  Also, the income she earns makes it profitable since she has customers in the city of Lima where she travels constantly.  There she sells three packages of rue or camomille for 2 PEN, twice the price that she gets in Tarma.  The advantage is that the plants grow quickly and are harvested in large quantities.  In the future she hopes to buy or build a house in the city of Tarma where she and her husband can live since her children will have their own families.  Through your help Maura will have access to her second loan through the MFP.  She is grateful for the confidence shown in her and is committed to paying back the loan on time.  She belongs to the communal bank \"Los \u00c1ngles de la Uni\u00f3n 2\", where she is happy to be a member and feels comfortable.  Maura plans to use the loan to buy sacks of fertilizer for 118 PEN each to treat the land where she grows spinach, peas and oregano for the December and January season.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":919074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy sacks of fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-16T22:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1014,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713143}],"funded_date":"2011-11-17T13:35:51Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":362445,"name":"Olga","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

Since 2003, Fahriddin has been rearing cattle. In the beginning of 2006 he found out about a microcredit program called MicroInvest. With his first loan he purchased 2 bulls. <p>\r\nFahriddin needs a new loan to expand his business in order to increase his profits. He lives in a village and has no problem feeding additional animals. In the future, Fahriddin plans to expand into milk processing business.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva Volunteer.<b><p>

children. Chama has owned a bakery for 13 years. She makes \u201cmankoucheh\u201d. A mankoucheh looks like a folded pizza; most common toppings are zaatar (thyme), jebneh (cheese) and lahm bi ajin (minced meat). You can eat it anytime of the day, but somehow it tastes better in the morning. Chama requested a loan of $500 US dollars from Al Majmoua to purchase raw materials for her business like cheese, flour, and oil. Chama has been a micro credit client for five years now and has always paid on time. <p>\r\n\r\nHer previous loans helped her improve her bakery and increase her income.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

That is why she works hard, with the support of her husband, to grow their business. For the financial support that her business needs in order to be enhanced, she is requesting a much larger loan from ASHI. In the hog fattening business, the more piglets being raised and sold either alive or slaughtered after four months, means the profit is as much as double the capital. This will enable Celerina to support the education of her child who is in college, by paying her tuition fees every trimester.

She is 44 years old. Isabel is widowed and has 1 adult child. To make a living, Isabel owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Isabel has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Isabel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Isabel is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Isabel from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":670871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Sta.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

which is made up of 10 members.  It is a very nice group that gets together with its credit advisor, working very enthusiastically with Pro-Mujer to improve their businesses.  The majority of the women have small children who do not have basic medical attention, that is to say, indispensable vaccines and medical checkups because of their lack of economic resources.  This situation is very concerning for their parents and has brought them to look for greater income in their small businesses.  <p>\r\n\r\nThe activities that the Kantutas association does are informal, that is to say, the mobile sale of different products.  For example, do\u00f1a Carmen sells scarves and wool gloves, Se\u00f1ora Mari sells candies and chocolates.  What is particular about this business are the sales that they make using little, special carts that they take along the distinct city streets. Now they would like to buy or rent fixed stands in the main markets to ensure sales.  For this, they require more capital for their work.  This way they will be able to generate greater income.  This is all for the good of their families, principally to insure the health and well-being of their children.  <p><b>Translated from Spanish by Joanna Silverman, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nEn la zona Huayna Potos\u00ed de la ciudad de El Alto se encuentra ubicado el centro focal Germ\u00e1n Buch, a este pertenece la asociaci\u00f3n \u201cKantutas\u201d integrado por 10 socias.\r\nUn grupo muy simp\u00e1tico que  junto  a su asesora de cr\u00e9ditos, trabajan con Pro-Mujer con mucho entusiasmo de mejorar en sus negocios.\r\nLa mayor\u00eda de ellas tienen ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os y estos no cuentan con  atenciones m\u00e9dicas b\u00e1sicas, vale decir  vacunas y valoraciones indispensables, esto por falta de recursos econ\u00f3micos.

She promises to repay the loan in 12 months and thanks everyone for supporting her. <P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The bracelets, necklaces and earring sets that she makes are both unique and beautiful. While she has occasionally sold her products in the past, this is the first time that she is trying to truly scale up her efforts. She is moving her sporadically lucrative hobby to a developed business venture.\n\nCarmen R. (far left) is a bright and engaging 50-year-old woman. She is both passionate and a true leader as evidenced by the fact that she is one of the coordinators of group Luz Cerito. Resting at the base of the tropical hills of the Los Alcarrizos barrio (community), La Pared, Carmen lives with her husband and two grown sons.\n\nOne of the main barriers that prevented Carmen from previously scaling up her work was lack of capital. She simply did not have the means to purchase the supplies she needed to make her jewelry. With this loan, she will be able to purchase these materials from a supplier in Santo Domingo, the capital, which is about an hour away from her home. Carmen plans to sell her jewelry from her house and her sister\u2019s salon as she figures women who have just had their hair done will be feeling beautiful and will be more willing to purchase jewelry to complement their new style.\n\nCarmen is excited about the opportunities that this loan will provide. She thinks it is wonderful that her hobby is becoming her profession and looks forward to a life that is more stable, tranquil, and peaceful. On behalf of Carmen Ramirez, the bank Luz Cerito, and the microfinance institute Esperanza International, thank you for providing opportunities to those who need them most.\n\nThis profile was written

I am applying for a loan to buy milk to grow the income of my milk-selling business. \n\nThis loan group is consists of five additional people: \n\nShamim baji wants a loan to buy a buffalo for her milk-selling business. \n\nMairaj baji and Khursheed begum baji each want a loan to buy fertilizer to sell. \n\nRamzana baji and Ghulam Fatima baji each want a loan to buy buffalos for their animal-selling business. \n\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible. \n\nNote: Khalida baji is standing third to the right among the baji\u2019s.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":356519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy milk to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"30 70","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khalida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Shamim ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mairaj ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Khursheed Begum ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ramzana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ghulam Fatima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2009-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2010-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2010-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3043.48},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":3043.44}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.05},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.05},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.05},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.05},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.05},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.05},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.05},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.04},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.05},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":128026,"name":"Chap","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Seventy-five per cent of Cambodian people have a farming business and Mrs. S. is one of them.

He is 24, single, and doesn't have children.  He studied through the 10th grade and didn't continue because of the lack of financial resources.  He lives in his sister's house and doesn't support anybody financially.  He left the Hulene neighborhood where his parents live for the Patrice Lumumba neighborhood (another neighborhood in the city of Matola) where his sister lives.  He has worked in the Central Hospital of Maputo (the biggest hospital in the country) for 4 years.  He works 8 hours a day and makes a monthly income of 2,093 meticais, which he applies to his expenses and saves some in his bank account.  He has never had a loan with another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through his neighbor, and this is his first loan for 10,000 meticais.  He will use it to buy construction materials (metal sheets, bricks, and sand) to be able to put a roof on part of his house.  He promises to pay back his loan on time to be able to request more loans so he can finish his house and buy furniture.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":435052,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of construction materials (metal sheets, sand, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.03,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Francisco ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":454.19},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":472.86},{"due_date":"2010-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":492.29},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":512.52},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.58},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":555.51},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":578.34},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":602.11},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":626.85},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":652.61},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":679.43},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":707.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":736.42},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":766.69},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":798.19},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":831.06}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15.9},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.23},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.94},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.07},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.94},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":23.78},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.76},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.77},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.84},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.93},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":21.1,"local_amount":602.74,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:18Z","rounded_local_amount":617.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110709091},{"amount":11.35,"local_amount":324.31,"processed_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-23T09:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":332.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118101643},{"amount":3.75,"local_amount":107.11,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:13Z","rounded_local_amount":109.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938227},{"amount":21.48,"local_amount":613.84,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-25T09:20:57Z","rounded_local_amount":629.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938228},{"amount":22.01,"local_amount":629.77,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:41Z","rounded_local_amount":645.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.03,"payment_id":128972075},{"amount":6.57,"local_amount":187.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:14:05Z","rounded_local_amount":192.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136698650},{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":555.51,"processed_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:27:57Z","rounded_local_amount":569.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144732329},{"amount":244.27,"local_amount":6979.05,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:42:46Z","rounded_local_amount":7154.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151916103}],"funded_date":"2009-12-17T08:38:49Z","paid_date":"2010-07-16T07:42:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":161042,"name":"Leonora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonora B. is from the village of Mambajao, Camiguin.

The hardworking young woman works full time at her business and this is how she helps her parents. Every morning Beatriz wakes up at the first ray of sun to go to her food selling business that is set up in a market in her area. She is the manager and she serves with the help of three young people. She is very satisfied with the business because it generates good earnings for her since it is well located. She serves from 8 in the morning selling breakfasts. Starting at midday she sells different meals and in the afternoons she prepares to serve lunch.  Although she often doesn't have enough to serve due to the number of guests who seek her delicious food and the low prices that she offers, she is planning on growing her business and opening another one in the area. This is the sixth loan she has had with MFP and she promises to make her payments on time since she doesn't want to look bad to the people who made this contribution possible that will keep her working in search of progress.  Beatriz is planning on investing the loan she is asking for in the purchase of tables and chairs she needs to better outfit the business she is going to open. She hopes to improve her earnings in this way.    \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":650119,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy tables and chairs to outfit her locale.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History <p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has two sons who now have their own homes and families, a daughter who has also left home to live with her husband, so the couple's only dependent child is an 18-year-old daughter.  Nasiba's husband left two years ago to start working in Almaty.  Each month he sends in some money to help with family expenses.

B. is 22 and has a secondary school education.  He is married.  Farhod has been buying and selling large livestock for two years.  Since it's hard to find a job in this region, this business is his main source of income.  He plans to use his loan to purchase a few young bulls to fatten and sell.  After each fattening cycle, which lasts 40-45 days, he will sell the fattened cattle and acquire more young bulls.  Most of his customers are residents of the Khuroson region, who use the cattle to make dairy and butcher products to sell to the local population.  Farhod plans to repay his loan within a 12-month period.   \r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Russian by Susie Armitage, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0411\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432

After the sale he used the profits and invested into business expansion. In addition he has also rented out a small space for manufacturing of confectioneries and hired several workers to produce them. He has not abandoned his cattle business though.

Rita's husband is her assistant in running her own business. \r\n\r\nWhen Rita joined ASHI in 2004, she had a loan to start up a business and was able to raise pigs. After raising several pigs and selling them, she has been able to start a general store that she is expanding. She wants to fill up her store with commodities needed by people in their village. The loan she requests now will be used to purchase canned foods, beverages, and rice. \r\n\r\nIn the years to come, Rita wishes to have more loans to be able to expand her general store into a mini grocery store that sells a lot of things people need every day of their lives.

She is 27 years old, single, and the mother of 2 children ages 3 and 9.  The oldest goes to the Boane Public School.  Odete went to school through the 6th grade and stopped early to be in the home.\r\n\r\nShe is recently separated and lives alone with her children in her own home.  She does not care for anyone else.  She grew up with her parents in the same district of Boane, and she never moved.  However, she has gone to South Africa to visit family.\r\n\r\nShe has been selling used clothing for all ages for more than 10 years in front of the market in the town of Boane.  She buys each bundle for 5,100MT and sells them for 7,500MT earning her 2,000MT at the end of each month.  Sometimes she sells a bundle and a half.\r\n\r\nShe has received other loans from similar institutions and paid them off without problems.  She got information about Hluvuku-Adsema through neighbors who are clients.  This will be her third loan with Hluvuku in the amount of 13,000MT to purchase bundles of used clothing.  She hopes to pay off the loan without issue so she can apply for more credit with the objective of constructing an brick establishment to improve the sales of her products and gain more customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":386790,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buy and Sell used clothing (all ages)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-09-14T15:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Odet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":571.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":597.07},{"due_date":"2009-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":624.06},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":652.27},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":681.76},{"due_date":"2010-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":712.58},{"due_date":"2010-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":744.79},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":778.46},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":813.65},{"due_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":850.43},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":888.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":929.06},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":971.06},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1014.96},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1060.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1108.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.97},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":22.97},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.09},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.22},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.4},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.65},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.29},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.71},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.19},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.73},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":39.04},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.8},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":21.97,"local_amount":571.25,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":596.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056884},{"amount":70.81,"local_amount":1841.08,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:29:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1922.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971838},{"amount":95.14,"local_amount":2473.52,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:07:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2582.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103816777},{"amount":102.22,"local_amount":2657.65,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:23:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2775.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708959},{"amount":209.86,"local_amount":5456.5,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-16T08:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5697.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123938002}],"funded_date":"2009-09-14T23:28:58Z","paid_date":"2010-03-16T08:23:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":140391,"name":"Librada","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Librada O. is from the village of Gumbil,Tudela,Misamis Occidental.
