It is based at Grand Thi\u00e8s and was created in 1992 by Ms. Maty Niakh, its current president. She got the idea of forming the network after participating in a training session run by Oxfam at Thi\u00e8s, in which she became familiar with group organization and running a business. The members of the group are dedicated to what they do, and meet together once a month. Over and above membership dues, each of them pays 200 FCFA a month into a group solidarity fund.\r\n\r\nLooking for financing, they decided to join U-IMCEC. The network is divided into 19 subgroups of five people so that financing can be better handled. Each subgroup has its own president and treasurer.\r\n\r\nThey now seek, for the second time, a loan of 100,000 FCFA per member or 500,000 FCFA for each subgroup, to grow their various activities. The members repay their loans to the president and the treasurer, Ms. Coumba S.. They, in turn, are responsible for repaying U-IMCEC. According to the president, the group\u2019s praiseworthy objective is to fight family poverty.\r\n\r\nFemmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b0 8 falls under the responsibility of Mrs. Khady F..

She acknowledges that is the earnings from her commerce that enabled her to take care of her child. She is joined in the Femmes Commer\u00e7antes N\u00b0 8 group by Mrs. Rokhaya N., a 53-year-old vendor of dried fish; Mrs. Fatou N., vendor of ice cream and local fruit juices; Mrs. Oumy M., an itinerant vendor of beauty products; and  Mrs. Sokhna Aminata S., who also sells perfume and thiouraye (incense).\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":516500,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Resupply merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-04-03T07:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Khady","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokhaya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokhna Aminata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:49Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759330},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790844},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971278},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708553},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:56Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922599},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-21T09:08:30Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189107},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-17T12:00:53Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484537},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T12:35:00Z","rounded_local_amount":62587.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620781}],"funded_date":"2010-04-10T16:08:40Z","paid_date":"2010-12-16T12:35:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":194063,"name":"Trina Mezhgan Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sosan is the daughter of M.

Also, Maksuda's family is involved in farming and grow potatoes, corn and alfalfa on two hectares of irrigated land; thus, earning a seasonal income from sales of the harvest.  In order to further develop her business, Maksuda requested a loan in the sum of 70,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase ewes.

<\/span><span style=\"color: #003300\">Senegal<\/span><span style=\"color: #003300\">\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as <em>tontines<\/em>.\u00a0 Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the <em>tontines<\/em> provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities.\u00a0 Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members.\u00a0 However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income.\u00a0 This has prevented the traditional <em>tontines<\/em> from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.\u00a0 Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.<\/span><\/font><\/font><span style=\"color: #003300; font-family:

This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

He and his wife make a living buying and selling clothes at times and by farming at other timers. They take part in various activities to generate extra income for their small household, and during the planting season they cultivate coffee, bananas and other products. Currently Luis has planted a regional vegetable called caigua with the goal of harvesting it when it can fetch a good price. Sometimes he takes some clothes to sell to the people in the areas surrounding his lands. The difficulty now, however, is that the price of fertilizer is high, but he still enjoys planting and harvesting all kinds of products, and he knows what season to plant which product to make the most of it in the market. At the moment Luis lives in the house of his mother-in-law, so he works arduously so he can acquire his own place and later his own vehicle so he can transport his products. With the loan, he will invest in cultivating caigua, and in five months he can double his return. He will harvest it in January and will sell it through February, the ideal time to sell this product.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":215327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Invest in cultivating caigua, a regional plant that will fetch good prices at the market.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-10-26T03:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-09T05:43:39Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.17},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":88.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957451},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:04:02Z","rounded_local_amount":88.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227701},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:03:37Z","rounded_local_amount":88.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20422936},{"amount":29.17,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:34:02Z","rounded_local_amount":88.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116160},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":88.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011120},{"amount":29.16,"local_amount":83.35,"processed_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:57Z","rounded_local_amount":88.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594723}],"funded_date":"2008-10-26T04:43:39Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":74420,"name":"Sokhum's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sokhum C. is a group leader of four who are all living in Khnong village in Kampong Chhnang Province.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Maruf is 47 years old and married, with three children between the ages of 22 and 14. Maruf manufactures, by order, carved wooden doors, window frames and partitions in the national oriental style. He has been in this business for twenty years. During that time, Maruf became a real expert in his business and has a lot of clients. Because of this, his business is very successful and brings in a stable and significant income, allowing Maruf to improve the living conditions of his family. Now Maruf has a large order for window frames and doors, so he is requesting $1500 to purchase the wood products and materials he needs for his manufacturing. Maruf is counting on your help, and he expresses his gratitude to everyone for supporting him.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

From a young age he demonstrated a talent for agriculture. Muhiddin has always tried to be very responsible and very content with his farm work. When he finishes caring for his crops, he goes to help his father, because he wants to repay his father\u2019s efforts. What his father likes best out of the whole agricultural process is the marketing, because he always hopes to get a good price for his crops. But once he gets to the market, he gets a little clumsy and sometimes loses track of the accounting. Muhiddin always tries to help him out with this. \r\n\r\nThe loan Muhiddin now is asking for is to purchase seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants for his varied crops. The loan will greatly improve Muhiddin\u2019s income and his family's living standards.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live in the Coastal place of Talim Island, Rizal Province in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, they got the idea of joining ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), which means \u201dTo rise up from poverty\u201d, an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines. She was given hope and the opportunity to acquire working capital, so she now runs her fishing business. The business has brought them good profits. Currently, on her second loan, she proposes the amount of 10,000 PHP as additional capital to pay for two sets of \"Baklad\" (fishing materials made of fishnet for creating fish pens), which cost 5,000 PHP each.\r\n\r\nCharis has simple dreams in life. She would like to have a durable, concrete house for themselves and for her future children. She also dreams of expanding the fishing business. With the service offered by ASHI, she believes that her dreams will come true.

She is 37 years old. Josephine is the group leader of a 10-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Josephine L.'s group.\r\n\r\nJosephine is married and has 3 school-aged children. Josephine owns & operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. Josephine has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Josephine joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and to have the ability to engage in business activities. Josephine has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Josephine is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the second loan taken out by Josephine from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1300,"image":{"id":533226,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is a mother of two and has been married for 4 years. She and her husband met in Guayas province, got married and settled in the city of Portoviejo.\r\nA friend encouraged her to join the community bank, and she is very satisfied with working with credit in her business. She sells rice in little sacks and has a small store in her own home. Her husband takes charge of the business, and travels to Guayas to buy rice in quintals (100 kg measurements) from distributors. They have done this for 1 year and it is going very well. Every day they set up a table outside of their house and sell rice by the pound, or however the client requests it.\r\nWith this loan, Mayra will be able to invest in more rice. Every week her husband has to travel and invest in 30 bags of rice; once they have it, they weigh it and divide it into different bags, depending on demand. They sell it all.\r\nIt is wonderful to know that her business is going well. It gives Mayra time to take care of their children, who are 2 and 4. She works for them: to be able to achieve the dream of owning their own home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":542748,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T23:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mayra Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:54Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892518},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:39Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632864},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:59Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846898},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:22Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113359},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:54Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406917},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:48Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406918}],"funded_date":"2010-06-04T00:47:41Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":206386,"name":"Nhor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Nhor C., 48, is a villager who lives in Phnum Lonteah village in Takeo province.

For 4 years she has been selling pigs and sheep. First she buys animals from farms and then tries to keep them in good condition until they reach exactly the right weight to be sold at the weekend livestock markets in her community. This is how she makes her weekly income. However, during the other days of the week, she works looking after children in her home, as her neighbors sometimes ask her to do this for them. On the other hand, her mother helps her with selling the animals and this work is quite profitable, especially during the holiday season. For this reason, Ang\u00e9lica wants to keep selling animals and to have more working capital. This is her 16th loan from MFP, and she is very happy to know that she has financial support and is very responsible about her repayments.

It is one of the villages in the Kati prefecture in the region of Koulikoro. \r\n\r\nBalla C. did not have the opportunity to go to school. At a very young age he became interested in revenue-generating activities such as the buying and selling of cereal grains. He learned this trade from his maternal uncle, who was once a great cereal grains merchant.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy his every growing clientele, he decided to join Soro Yiriwaso (Kiva Field Partner).

Untiring efforts, strong management skills and patience helped her to attain this status. Being born in a typical farming family, Ainura used to help her father in land cultivation and cattle breeding. \r\n\r\nTen years ago, she took full control of livestock left as a family heritage and since then has never looked back. \r\n\r\nAinura invested 15,000 KGS in a purchase of young calves. Step by step she expanded her activities with expected returns and soon saw good economic gains from cattle reselling. Today she is a proud owner of one of the largest households in the district. \r\n\r\nAinura\u2019s next step in business promotion is dairy. She plans to distribute the generated milk products to local customers.

A little while after she decided to dedicate herself, in an ambulatory way, to selling foodstuffs and opened her grocery store near her house.\r\n<p>\r\nDue to the large demand for her typical foodstuffs, she wishes to open a caf\u00e9 in the future which will offer better and more comfortable service to the population and increase the quantity of clients.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She hopes that they continue in this manner for a long time, helping many families and entreprenurial women.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kimberly Baker, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":470832,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy groceries","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salvadora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":358.33,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":1021.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954447},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:34Z","rounded_local_amount":510.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987471},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713490},{"amount":179.16,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:33Z","rounded_local_amount":510.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746556},{"amount":179.17,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-27T07:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":510.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151929761}],"funded_date":"2010-02-09T14:48:09Z","paid_date":"2010-07-27T07:48:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kimberly Baker","image":79832}},{"id":173103,"name":"My's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"M\u1ef9 Th\u1ecb P. is 59 years old.

Together they take care of their only child, a daughter, in their home in Baseco, Manila.\r\n\r\nTo cope with financial difficulties, Patricia has set up her own carinderia (food stall) located in Intramuros, Manila. Here, she cooks delicious meals for customers who find it easier to buy cooked food than to prepare their own, especially on busy days. Patricia has been running her carinderia for seven years. She is also buys and sell palay (rice grain). Her entrepreneurial efforts earn her Php11,000 per month.\r\n\r\nTo improve her carinderia, she decided to borrow Php30,000 with the help of CCT* to improve both her food business as well as her trading business. Aside from quality food ingredients, she also intends to buy palay and sell it to business connections. She plans to have small homes to rent to boarders. \r\n\r\nOne struggle Patricia faces is family finances, as the price of the goods in the market has soared. But she knows she will overcome, because the Lord of her life is one faithful Provider. She desires to see the expansion of her business and allow her family to experience prosperity. Currently, she is saving up for her child\u2019s education. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She lives with her husband and their two children in her own house.  She devotes herself to farming.  She does this work in her native land; a beautiful, rural farming village.  She has been there almost all of her life because her parents raised her there.  They taught her how to cultivate the land.\r\n\r\nShe now has a strong family, which is why she farms.  It is an important source of income for her household.  She works with her husband and her children in each season in order to grow potatoes, corn, wheat, barley, beans, and other products in her zone.  Harvest time is the busiest, and they generally need more help.  That is when they hire field workers to harvest the crops.  In both seasons she always needs cash on hand to buy seeds, to rent a yoke of oxen, and for the other needed tools.  \r\n\r\nThat is why she always requests a loan.  The loans have always helped with her financial growth.  That is the reason that she later wishes to acquire more farm land and to be a wholesaler of her harvested products.\r\n\r\nThis time she will use the loan to buy sacks of fertilizer, which is indispensable in preparing the land.  This is the eighth loan that she has requested from MFP.  She has extensive experience with loans with her communal bank, and she remembers them gratefully.

It was a key post along the Silk Road and served as the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous, leaving only 7 percent of arable land. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nMore about IMON International:\r\n \r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Jacoba meets with her fellow members of the Fe Y Progreso (Faith and Progress) communal bank every two weeks.\r\n\r\nJacoba is a founding member of her communal bank, and she likes it because of the help that her loans have always given her.  She is 67, married, and has 8 children who are independent adults.  She lives with one grandson who is 18 and is like her own son.  Her husband is retired.\r\n\r\nOur friend has a grocery store in her home where she sells all kinds of products like:  rice, sugar, oils, detergents, candy, soft drinks, etc.  She works there every day from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m., and her husband helps her with her work.  She has had her store for 18 years, and she started it with her first loan that she received from the institution.  She is very grateful this since her store is her reason for living.  In addition to earning her living from it, it is also a way to distract herself with her customers.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan to further stock her store.  She is going to buy rice, sugar, oil, detergents, sausages, and other basic goods.\r\n\r\nHer goals are to get ahead with her business so that it will grow more every day."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":854086,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy rice, sugar, oils, detergents, sausages, and other basic goods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2011-08-26T02:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacoba Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":137.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:09:44Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227037319},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:03:43Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232797897},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:14:53Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238608989},{"amount":275,"local_amount":275,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:53:09Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244563259},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:04:01Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250774234}],"funded_date":"2011-08-26T15:35:34Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:04:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":333442,"name":"Marcia Lorena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

","en":"Sanabarkhon is 60 years old and a widow. She had raised five children who have mostly left to Russia for work. Sanabarkhon had been working for twenty years as chief nurse in the local hospital and now is in retirement. Her pension is 2,800 som (KGS) monthly, which is about $60. Since the salary of medical workers in Kyrgystan is low, Sanabarkhon had started a second hand resale store back in 2000. She sells used TVs, rugs, refrigerators and the like. To further expand her second hand business Sanabarkhon has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 100,000 som (KGS) which she will use to expand her

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling food products such as repacked \"ginataang langka\" or green jack fruit with coconut milk in the local community. Annabella has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Annabella joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Annabella has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Annabella is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Annabella from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She lives in Prk. Yanog, Brgy. Tampalon, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts.\r\n\r\n By working hard in her pig-fattening and general store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000. Erenea is now borrowing PHP 12,000 so that she can fund her business operations. This will be her 4th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Erenea aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She learned her trade from her parents who were <i>ginamos<\/i> makers. In 1955, when she was still a teenager, she started buying fresh krill and making her own ginamos. She sold her products in nearby towns by setting up a stand in each town's market during market day. She continued her ambulatory business even after she got married and, by then, she already had a few regular customers who came to her house to buy her <i>ginamos<\/i>. \r\n<p>\r\nBecause she wanted to expand her business, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1994 to access additional capital. She put her entire first loan into her business and she got very good returns on her investment. For the past 15 years, while she's been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has maintained her good credit standing by paying her loans on time and attending the center meetings. As her business prospered, Felicidad expanded her product lines. She now also sells <i>asin<\/i> (sea salt) and coconut wine called <i>tuba<\/i>. She earns an average monthly net income of 16,000 pesos from her business activities, and this has been a big help in defraying the family's expenses, with enough left over to pay for the education of her children in previous years. She was also able to renovate her house with her savings.\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Felicidad S. is a 69-year-old married woman with six adult children ranging in age from 31 to 42 years old. She is from Brgy. Canjusa, Pulupandan, Negros Occidental. By sheer will and determination, she was able to send all of her children to school to earn their college degrees. All of them now have their own families and are gainfully employed. Their achievements have made Felicidad very proud and, for her, she has already attained her life's dream \u2013 according to her, all because she had NWTF-Project Dungganon for support all these years. \r\n<p>\r\nFelicidad is a businesswoman with good entrepreneurial instincts who seeks new opportunities so that she can provide her family with financial security. Now she wants to borrow 12,000 pesos for her 15th  loan cycle to use mainly as additional working capital for her ginamos business and the rest for her sea salt and coconut wine ventures.\r\n<p>\r\n<u>A little about <i>ginamos<\/i>, <i>asin<\/i> and <i>tuba<\/i>:<\/u>\r\n\"<i>Ginamos<\/i>\" is a generic Hiligaynon (the local dialect in the Western Visayas Islands) term for anything that is salted and allowed to ferment. But when referring to other salted products, it is qualified by adding the item that was salted. For example, salted duck's eggs are called <i>ginamos nga itlog<\/i>, salted fish is called <i>ginamos nga isda<\/i>, and salted mussels are called <i>ginamos nga tahong<\/i>. When the term \"<i>ginamos<\/i>\" is used alone, it usually refers to the pasty product made from minute shrimp-like crustaceans (possibly pacific krill) that are salted, dried and pounded into a paste. <i>Ginamos<\/i> is known as \"<i>bagoong<\/i>\" in Tagalog, although some of the processing steps are a bit different and the taste is also a bit different. Negrenses pride themselves on being the makers of the best <i>ginamos<\/i> in the country, and Pulupandan is one of the towns that has the tradition and recipe handed down for several generations. <i>Ginamos<\/i> is used as a flavor enhancer in a lot of Filipino dishes, but it is also a dish in itself. It is usually cooked by adding coconut vinegar and sauteed with lots of crushed garlic and a little bit of sugar to balance the saltiness. Sometimes fried pork rind is added to make it even more special. It is usually served with green mangoes or as a side dish for <i>kare-kare<\/i>, a Filipino dish made with oxtail or beef cooked in a peanut sauce with vegetables.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Asin<\/i>, or sea salt, is made by sun drying sea water on shallow flats until the liquid evaporates and salt crystals appear. Once the salt bed is dry, the salt crystals are gathered and packed into sacks for distribution. Sea salt remains the preferred flavor enhancer in many Negrense kitchens, because many cooks contend that sea salt packs a better flavor than the fine iodized table salt sold in groceries.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Tuba<\/i>, or coconut wine, is made, not from coconut water inside the coconut, but rather by \"wounding\" the unopened flower clusters and collecting the sweet sap drops into a container. The flower clusters are usually lacerated early in the morning to get the sweeter sap, and the containers are usually gathered in the afternoon just in time for the men to arrive home from work. The slightly alcoholic beverage makes a refreshing drink after a hard day in the fields. If the <i>tuba<\/i> is not consumed within the day, it is kept in glass bottles in a cool dark place to ferment into vinegar. Like balsamic vinegar, tuba vinegar improves with age. Tuba vinegar is one of the most fragrant and flavorful vinegars in the Philippines.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to realities surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life that can finally be called honorable.

To make a living, Lucila owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops.

Lucila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase general farm supplies & equipment. Lucila is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the 12th loan taken out by Lucila from PMPC.
