Istatkhon is 29 years old. She has a son with her husband. Istatkhon has been running her own business for more than four years. She has a small saloon where she sells and rents traditional and national wedding dresses. Traditionally families in Tajikistan are large and consequently there are many marriages so Istatkhon has a lot of clients. The stability of her business allows her to make a considerable contribution to the family income. This is  Istatkhon's second loan with IMON International and during the previous loan cycle she was accurate and precise in the loan payments. Istatkhon is requesting $ 1300 USD in order to purchase more wedding dresses. \r\n<br>\r\nTajikistan and IMON International:\r\n<br>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. Tajikistan is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<br>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<br>\r\nIMON's History:\r\n<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has two children aged 18 and 21 years old.  She has been in business since a young age when she arrived in Barranquilla with the dream of completing Higher education studies, but as she was unable to pay for them she decided to work in a clothing department store where she gained her experience.  Once her first child was born she left her job and, using her social security benefits, she fulfilled her dream of being a businesswoman. She strengthened her business with financing from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, an organisation which allowed her to extend her physical infrastructure and increase her stock levels, and so increase her client base. She tells us that when she started her business in 1992, she had no capital to supply as she had invested it in buying the shop and two glass cabinets, so she went to her sister-in-law who worked as a machine operator in a clothing factory. Mabel bought materials and supplies and worked according to the designs suggested by her sister-in-law. In 1996 she joined the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo group, an organisation which has lent her a hand ever since. She started out with $300,000 COP and today she is applying for a loan of $1,400,000 COP, via Kiva, which is the eighth loan that she will have had from this organisation. With the loan she will purchase a laptop computer to record her finances and manage the administration of her small business, which is already well structured and with this piece of equipment she will improve the way that she manages her time. Mabel Rodr\u00edguez feels that she is a very successful woman and has achieved this with the support of her family, and due to her capacity for resistance when faced with adversities while working in good faith. This has allowed her to improve the quality of her family's life and strengthen her free, independent and self-sufficient spirit.  Her dream is to have an office to build her stock rotation and increase her profits.  Mabel says that her business has taught her to manage her profits so that new trends in fashion do not put her out of business, because her classic styles appeal to a special type of women and girls attending special parties such as first grade communions and very formal events.

comes from the village of Speti, Imereti Region, West Georgia. He is 56 years old and married. His family consists of four persons: Gocha, his wife Deniza, 25-year-old daughter and 22-year-old son. Gocha works as a joiner. He produces different wooden products (furniture, household goods) in his workshop and sells them locally. Deniza works as teacher in a local school. \r\n\r\nAlong with his main job, Gocha also finds time for the family's farming business. They have three milk cows and two pigs. Deniza produces cheese and sells it at the local market. The piglets are also sold locally. \r\n\r\nThe total average monthly income of the family is 600 Laris. \r\n\r\nGocha requests a loan to purchase a new, modern joiner's bench for wood processing. The new plan will allow him to diversify his production and offer new products to the customers. At the same time, the quality of his work will increase and he\u2019ll be able to sell more products, as well as slightly raise the prices. The income of the family will increase and they\u2019ll be able to improve their living

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They are from a small community but one that has a lot of culture and many customs. The area is noted for it serenity where the inhabitants are farm labourers, workers or traders.\r\n\r\nThey named the group \"Rieles\" because they live near some railway tracks and have always lived there. They know that the train used go by there a long time ago according to their ancestors. However, the tracks fell apart and now are in poor condition. Ofcourse no train runs there now but the tracks remain.\r\n\r\nDon Felipe ,the group representative says \"Ever since I can remember the tracks have been there. So when they asked us what we wanted to name the group we decided to call it \"Rieles\" (tracks)\". He is 47 years old and has been married to Se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Carmen for the last 26 years. None of their children are dependents now as they are all married and live on their own. \r\n\r\nHe is asking for a loan to buy 6 suckling piglets. At home he has 4 female piglets and a stud. He has been breeding livestock for 15 years.\r\n\r\nHe says that at the moment he has no problem not even his pigs becoming sick. He says this is because he prefers to buy suckling pigs rather than from a farm as the ones from the farm are very sensitive to the cold and are not used to the countryside. The suckling pigs are the complete opposite never getting sick even if left in the cold and they are fine even if taken out to graze in the fields.\r\n\r\nAlthough he has well-constructed corrals at home, he has 6 he means to fill with suckling pigs as he just sold some and has almost no pigs left.\r\nDon Felipe gives his thanks to FRAC, \"Thank you for the loan because it helps me keep my piglets healthy and strong.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":871694,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 6 suckling pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-10-03T14:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Celia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felipe","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3000},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":237.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":237.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:12:43Z","rounded_local_amount":3110.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784818},{"amount":237.5,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:42:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3110.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270043976}],"funded_date":"2011-10-04T20:38:53Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T09:42:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Blyth","image":null}},{"id":342102,"name":"Khurshed","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u0425\u0443\u0440\u0448\u0435\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0431. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442, 29 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0416\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0442. \u0418\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439. \u041e\u043d \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0425\u0443\u0440\u0448\u0435\u0434 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0442 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0443 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u043e\u0431 \u2013 \u0414\u0443\u0448\u0430\u043d\u0431\u0435. \u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044b.\n\n","en":"Khurshed lives in the town of Kulob.

 Mu\u1ed9n is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by SEDA.

The official name of this borrowing group is V\u1ecdng Nguy\u1ec7t 1.\r\n\r\nMu\u1ed9n is married and has 3 school-aged children.  To making a living, Mu\u1ed9n owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising livestock.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from raising pigs for sale.  Mu\u1ed9n has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nMu\u1ed9n joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Mu\u1ed9n is requesting for the first time a loan from SEDA.   She is a loan of 5,152,000 VND, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise & sell in the future.   Mu\u1ed9n plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n1.  Th\u1ee9c  is a 31-year-old female who is requesting a 7,840,000 VND loan to support her business in the agriculture sector raising chickens.\r\n\r\n2.

is Amelia, 62, a resident of GMA, Cavite, Philippines. Her husband is Emmanuel, who is retired.  She and her husband manage their household while operating her business. She works hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                 \r\n            \r\nAmelia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which sells groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a small amount of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns profit by buying supplies at wholesale prices and selling at retail. She also sells honey bee products for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 17,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nAmelia hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":928272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"GMA, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-11-25T16:40:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":17000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":708.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":708.41}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":6374.97,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":6487.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738801},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2833.03,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2883.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146033},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2834,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2884.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275139},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3541,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:05Z","rounded_local_amount":3603.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997761},{"amount":33.34,"local_amount":1417,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1442.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276606345}],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T00:53:35Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:03:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Deborah Kerman","image":193796}},{"id":366701,"name":"Mar\u00eda De Los Santos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa Sra.

In 1996, in a search for income for his family, Djanybek decided to start his own business in farming and field work.

He is married to a trader, and has 4 children aged 12, 9, 6 years and a 10 months old baby, two are school-going children. He has one additional dependent, who lives with him because he helps in the business. In 2005, Osman established his electronics business.  He began his business because of the rebel war that broke in his country of Sierra Leone. Osman says, \"I was in form three (school grade 9 in the U.S) when the rebels attacked us in our village called Sanda twenty miles off from Makeni. Then we fled to Makeni and started working for people for our survival. During that time, I started raising funds until I got a substantial amount to start my business.\" Working 7 days a week and 11 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,796,000 every month from this business. He would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000 . Osman has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan and now needs a new loan in order to buy tape (6 batteries) - 8 pieces @ Lr125,000, radio - 10 pieces @ Le45,000, radio with memory card - 5 pieces @ Le75,000, tape (4 batteries) - 8 pieces @ Le65,000 and electronic lanterns - 1 carton @ Le1,000,000.  The balance will be used for transport. He hopes that this loan will enable him to increase his monthly profits by approximately Le 269,000. In the future, Osman plans to open a shop. He felt good about taking out this loan as it helps him to boost his business.  He wants his children to have a good education. The loan will help greatly because he will be able to make a profit out of it.  Increases in the cost of goods affects him greatly because as costs change, he has to change his selling prices which affects his customers' buying pattern.  He offers quality products.  Osman serves at least 20 people per day around the city.  His business is popular because he treats his customers fairly and with respect.  He is assisted by family members. He buys his goods in Conakry twice per month and in Freetown once every week.  He saves some of his profit, some he uses to add to his working capital. He plans to expand if he is given subsequent loans that will enable him to accomplish his dreams.  He thanks you for your support.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":987446,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy electronics for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2012-01-21T04:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Osman","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2012-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.44},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":444444.48}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.77},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.77},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.78},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":102.78,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T07:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":449652.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263505737},{"amount":102.78,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":449652.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269974842},{"amount":102.77,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:13:20Z","rounded_local_amount":449652.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276815407},{"amount":102.78,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:05:31Z","rounded_local_amount":449652.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283444461},{"amount":102.78,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:02:49Z","rounded_local_amount":449652.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287537174},{"amount":102.78,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:56:23Z","rounded_local_amount":449652.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294284644},{"amount":102.77,"local_amount":444444.44,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":449652.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301338212},{"amount":205.56,"local_amount":888888.92,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:37Z","rounded_local_amount":899305.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308354615}],"funded_date":"2012-01-23T19:35:04Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T08:49:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victoria Lazarova","image":1669010}},{"id":416058,"name":"Denis Elena","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Denis se encuentra casada y junto con su esposo viven en un apartamento ubicado en la cancha deportiva de su municipio; ellos son los encargados del aseo del lugar, por lo que no tienen que pagar alg\u00fan arriendo por esto.

Adem\u00e1s, Denis sue\u00f1a con alg\u00fan d\u00eda poder tener una gran tienda general ubicada en un lugar m\u00e1s estrat\u00e9gico y comercial y as\u00ed poder tener mayores ingresos para su futuro. \n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1073096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Compra de dulces, snack, y gaseosas para surtir su negocio y un refrigerador donde pueda almacenar las gaseosas.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"El Carmen de Viboral","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Denis Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43461},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":44681},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45934},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47223},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":48548},{"due_date":"2012-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":49911},{"due_date":"2012-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":51311},{"due_date":"2012-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52751},{"due_date":"2013-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54231},{"due_date":"2013-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55753},{"due_date":"2013-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":57318},{"due_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":58926},{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60580},{"due_date":"2013-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62280},{"due_date":"2013-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":64027},{"due_date":"2013-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65824},{"due_date":"2013-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67671},{"due_date":"2013-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":69570}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.99},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.69},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.41},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.16},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.91},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.7},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.5},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.34},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.18},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.06},{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.96},{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.88},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.83},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.81},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.82},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.91},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":432451,"name":"Benkadi Kagoua 2 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Les  membres du groupe  Benkadi Kagoua 2 sont des femmes mari\u00e9es  ayant une moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de 40 ans, 4 enfants et vivant toutes dans des  familles traditionnelles \u00e0 Kouroubadougou, un des villages de San, 4\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative du Mali. \nElles collaborent avec l\u2019institution de microfinance Soro Yiriwaso afin de mener \u00e0 bien leurs activit\u00e9s agricoles pendant l\u2019hivernage. \nElles sont \u00e0 leur troisi\u00e8me pr\u00eat avec l\u2019institution, les pr\u00eats pass\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 bien rembours\u00e9s.\nLa sp\u00e9culation cultiv\u00e9e est  l\u2019arachide  avec    KADIATOU,  assise avec une \u00e9charpe jaune, sur la photo.\nAvec son pr\u00eat, elle compte  acheter des intrants, semence, des petits mat\u00e9riels agricoles et payer les frais de labour  pour l\u2019exploitation de 0,5 hectare. \nLa production sera vendue au niveau du village et au march\u00e9 de San, apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9colte, \u00e0 une client\u00e8le compos\u00e9e d\u2019hommes et de femmes. \nElle compte r\u00e9aliser un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice moyen de 55.000 FCFA par campagne.\nCe b\u00e9n\u00e9fice lui permettra de payer son pr\u00eat et aussi d\u2019aider son mari dans les d\u00e9penses quotidiennes.  \nNB\/ DJELIKA absente\n","en":"The members of the Benkadi Kagoua 2 group are married women with an average age of 40, with 4 children and all living in traditional families in Kouroubadougou, one of the villages in San, the fourth largest administrative region of Mali.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The couple is blessed with three children who are between 19 and 23 years old and have their own families. But they are still partially dependent on their parents.\r\n\r\nThe couple works together to sustain their needs by engaging in a Tailoring business. This business has been a big help to them in raising their children and sending them to school. Their business continued to be their source of livelihood and slowly expanded but at some point, they needed more capital to continue expanding their business. This is why Virgenia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1991. She used the money she borrowed to buy Ready-to-Wear clothes, sandals, slippers and other accessories to sell. From this new venture, she was able to earn more. She used the income to defray the household expenses, paid her loan installments and the rest she plowed back into the business as working capital.\r\n\r\nAs time went by, she was able to continue using her subsequent loans to expand operations of her RTW business and still continue helping her husband with the tailoring since they shared the same space in the Escalante Public Market. Since they have been in the clothing business for over 20 years, they have gathered loyal and regular customers who also bought the ready-to-wear clothes she had for sale, so the business earns a good income of approximately PHP 15,000 a month. They are able to support their extended family and have enough left over to reinvest back in the business. \r\n\r\nFor her previous loan, she borrowed PHP 18,000 and used this as working capital for her Tailoring and Ready to Wear Business. She paid all of her weekly installments on time and fully paid it within the loan term. Now she is borrowing the same amount of PHP 18,000 for her 17th cycle loan and the income from this will be used for house improvements. And they are looking forward to buying an electric sewing machine sometime soon so that they can finish the custom-made clothes faster with less physical effort than the manual sewing machine. They anticipate that having an electric sewing machine will allow them to increase their daily output and they will be able to accept more custom work, hence increasing their income capacity.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

25 years old. The family lives in the village of Brgy Miranda Hinigaran Negros Occidental. Georgina dreams of giving a proper education to her three children so that someday they will be gainfully employed, and not have to go through the difficulties she experienced in her life, needing to work hard just to survive. \r\n\r\nThese aspirations make Georgina a strong mother to her children and mobilize her to earn for the future and family by helping her husband earn a living for their family. She started with a small general store adjacent to her house, which helped a lot in supplementing their family income, but as her children grew older, their needs also grew, especially in relation to their education. She also wanted to expand her business and offer her customers a wider range of products. This motivated her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon and that was how she started to expand her business. Now she has an electronic reloading station - selling prepaid load to mobile phone users.  Now she earns an average of PHP 10,000 per month.\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan, she borrowed Php 23,000, which she used as additional capital for her general store and electronic reloading. The said amount was paid within her loan term in full without delays. Now she is borrowing Php 24,000 as additional capital for her general store and to invest in a food vending business.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":423610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is 43 years old. Elna is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Elna runs a sari-sari (variety) retail shop, selling a variety of different products in the local community. Elna has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 16,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Elna joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Elna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Elna is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Elna from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They have three children who are from 25 to 33 years old.\r\n\r\nAdelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she wished for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 13,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 4,000 PHP, uplifting her family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 9th loan, Adelita is borrowing 16,000 PHP which she intends to use to buy utensils and supplies for her food stall and fertilizer for her farm. She plans to use her profits to save for future expansion of her agricultural business.\r\n\r\nAdelita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

For this, she has requested Edpyme Alternativa a loan of 1,500 new soles ($550) to buy an industrial sewing machine.  She will also invest part of her loan in buying feed for the birds.

She works seven days a week.\r\n<p>\r\nShe has done this business for 15 years now, though prior to this she was selling roasted chicken. The main challenge she faces while doing this business is that she pays high rent for the place she works. The rainy season also affects her business so much because most of the village roads where she collects her charcoal from are spoiled by the rains so transporting becomes difficult.\r\n<p>\r\nShe has been with Kiva's partner MCDT for six years now and the reason why she chose MCDT was because she wanted to access loans to improve in her business. She has worked with her group for six years and she will use this loan to increase her stock.

She is 37 years old, married, and is the mother of 2 children who are 18 and 15 years old. Both children attend school. Celeste only studied through 9th grade, and didn't continue because of her parents' lack of financial resources. She lives in her own home with her husband, who works as a driver, and she isn't responsible for supporting anyone else financially.\r\n\r\nShe left the neighborhood where she lived with her parents to go to the Jardim neighborhood with her husband. She has owned her own business for more that 2 years and doesn't have any other employees. She doesn't work on a fixed schedule but works around 12 hours a day. She earns approximately 5500.00 meticales each month, and uses this money to pay for household expenses. She also saves some money each week through Xitique (a traditional system of rotating savings).\r\n\r\nCeleste has never taken out a loan with another bank. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through a neighbor who also works with the institution. This is her 1st loan, for the amount of 20,000.00 Meticales.

She and her husband have been direct selling Avon products for more than five years and also embarked in buying and selling dried fish in the local community. \r\n\r\nShe now proposes that her eighth loan, amounting to 45,000.00 Philippine pesos, be used to continue her businesses with the support of her husband.

She has two children, who study in the preparatory school, and her older daughters help her in her work, since it is a tedious job.  \r\n<p>\r\nJanet is not married, and her activity within the business is to make the flowers that decorate the products that they make.  Severina is a widow and doesn't have any children that depend on her anymore.  She is in charge of the sewing of the coverings as well as the hats that they make.  Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas is in charge of the painting and drying of the corn leaves, marsh leaves, palm leaves, and to cut the sticks to make the knapsacks.  Mar\u00eda Elena is in charge of buying the joloche (corn leaves), marsh leaves, palm leaves, ribbons, and other raw materials that they need to make their products.  This group sells their products to the artisans that are located in the city of Villahermosa, as well as in events that the state or municipal government put on.\r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda Jes\u00fas, her mother, and her daughters, will use the loan for the purchase of raw materials such as glue, ribbon, palm leaves, marsh leaves, kabob sticks, paint, wire, fabric for coverings, thread, string, needles and the rest of the accessories that they need to decorate the products that they make.  This group has a long term dream to have a spacious and well-located place in the city of Villahermosa where their products have demand and where their business can be self-sustainable.  They are very hard-working and responsible women.  It is a family group, and therefore their motto is: \"There is strength in numbers\", and it is from there that they derive their name.  \r\n<p>\r\nThey are grateful for the support offered by the Foundation and KIVA, since the loan granted has served them a lot to get ahead in their activities, and by continuing to work with this loan, every time they see themselves closer to realizing their dream. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amy McGinty, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":552370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy sticks, paints, glue, wire, thread, palm leaves, and silicon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Nacajuca, Tabasco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-06-13T09:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Jesus ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Severina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Janet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":13000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1001.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1015.9},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1030.24},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1044.79},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1059.54},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1074.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1089.68},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1105.06},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1120.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1136.49},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1152.54},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1168.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.98},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.1},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.23},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.38},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.54},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.72},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.92},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.13},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.61},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.87},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":92.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":159.08,"local_amount":2017.65,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:50:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2048.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151899584},{"amount":163.61,"local_amount":2075.03,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:17:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2106.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159639929},{"amount":168.26,"local_amount":2134.04,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2166.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854211},{"amount":261.41,"local_amount":3315.41,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:08Z","rounded_local_amount":3365.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121108},{"amount":89.61,"local_amount":1136.49,"processed_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1153.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415159},{"amount":90.87,"local_amount":1152.54,"processed_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1169.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415160},{"amount":92.16,"local_amount":1168.84,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1186.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554908}],"funded_date":"2010-06-17T20:53:30Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Amy McGinty","image":348203}},{"id":210982,"name":"Josefina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josefina L. is from the town of Santa Josefa.

She lives in Lower Calasa, Brgy. Caradio-an, Himamaylan, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her farming business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 7,500.  Ma. Melanie is now borrowing PHP 22,000 so that she  can fund the operations of her rice fields. This will be her 15th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 20,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Ma. Melanie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.  About NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She has three years of experience in this business. Luaao needs a loan of WST $1900.00 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve and expand the business.\n\nIn 2009, Luaao joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Luaao's third loan with SPBD. \n\n\n\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers.  Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

He tells us that he started this work because he did not have enough money for his studies. He say that his parents could not invest any more money in him, because his father's income was so unstable and there were four younger siblings in the family to support. German did not let this stop him. He decided to go to work and has seen the fruit of his labour. He normally works with his beloved wife, but they still need to hire labourers, especially for the harvest.\r\nGerman and his family are happy because, thanks to MFP's support, their crops are consistently in good condition.

The high cost of pig feed is difficult for Ms. Made to raise her animals. Seasonal Field's results, and uncertain husband's income, made her apply for funds and training from Dinari.

for the \u2018desembolsa\u2019, the meeting for the community bank Nueva Santa Catarina where its 11 members will have their requested loans approved.  The women gather excitedly, talking rapidly in their native language K\u00b4iche\u00b4, while their children play in the folds of their dresses, giggling timidly.  These women are strong and have endured much, yet more than exhaustion they emit hope and joy.  As a community bank, they are proud to have been together eight years, their bank was the first of the now four banks in their small community.  \r\n\r\n<P>Located about an hour and a half from the region\u2019s capital, Solol\u00e1, the 11 women dedicate themselves to the beautiful and intricate art of weaving huipiles, native Mayan blouses.  A single huipil can take up to one month to make, and after an investment of about 200 Quetzales (about $25), they can sell it for about 500 Quetzales (about $60).  Currently, the women sell their huipiles in the nearby town of Nahuala, and they are well known in their community so customers also come directly to their home to make purchases.  \r\n\r\n<P>Of the 11 women, almost half can read and write, which is a very large percentage for the area.  They are smart in business, and are looking for new ways to expand.  They\u2019ve recognized the large number of sales that tourism brings in, and are hoping to implement an export business or connect with a nearby community where tourism is more prevalent than in their town and open a market there.   As a group they are asking for a loan of 33,500 Quetzales, about $4400, $400 per person, which they will invest in various colored threads to weave their huipiles.  A few of the women are also planning on using part of their loan to hire extra help so they can increase the rate of production and make more

From a young age Francisco has described himself as being hard-working and enterprising, as when he was young he began to work in a bakery, where he learned a trade that helped him quite a bit.\r\n\r\nHe traveled to Argentina in 1992 where he was able to save a bit of money to return to his country and become a traveling vendor of pastries and sweet rolls that he himself made. Today the sales of his sweets is one of his sources of income, he prepares his rolls in the early morning hours and then he can leave and sell them in the neighborhood, traveling by bicycle house to house in the afternoons and on Sundays at soccer games.\r\n\r\nThe other job he does is gardening. He gardens at private homes, an activity that has been growing and today this generates more income than his baked goods.\r\n\r\nThe loan he is seeking is to buy a lawn mower for his gardening service, this is an item he needs in order to be more efficient with his work.\r\n\r\nThanks to his enterprising spirit he has been able to acquire a plot of land where he has begun building his own

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a 38-year-old married mother of two children. Her children are ages 15 and 19.\r\n \r\nRita started her own clothing business six years ago to sell things like vitenge and kanga (fabrics). The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric, often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. Rita works 12 hours a day and earns a monthly profit of approximately 200,000 Tanzania Shillings (about $152).\r\n\r\nThis is Rita\u2019s first loan from BRAC Tanzania. She has requested 200,000 Tsh in order to buy more vitenge and kanga. With the additional profit she gains from the use of this loan, Rita hopes to buy even more vitenge and kanga. \r\n\r\nBenadeta, another member of the borrower group, has requested 150,000 Tsh in order to support her own charcoal business.

She works selling perfumes and deodorants from 7:00 AM to 6:30 PM each day. She earns approximately 800-1000 Meticales a day, and uses this money to pay for household expenses. She also saves some money in her bank account.\r\n\r\nAdelia has never taken out a loan with another bank. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through a friend who also works with the institution. This is her 2nd loan, for the amount of 25,000 Meticales.

Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 10,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nMerciditha is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 12,000 was used to fund the operations of her retail store and food vending, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 17th cycle loan in the amount of Php 10,000, which she intends to use for her retail store and food vending. Merciditha is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the poverty alleviation program, NWTF is empowering women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of the community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":542315,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
