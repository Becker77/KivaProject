AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on Kiva."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":216011,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more fertilizers to support the soil and  make the rice fields more productive.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":109,"posted_date":"2008-10-22T16:30:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vun","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yoem","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bech","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sot","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Phan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-05T19:16:45Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":1600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":160000},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":160000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":145.03,"local_amount":580100,"processed_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-15T20:17:38Z","rounded_local_amount":595951.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5286354},{"amount":9.97,"local_amount":39900,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T12:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":40990.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9899304},{"amount":10,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:56:05Z","rounded_local_amount":41093,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14823454},{"amount":10.03,"local_amount":40100,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:53:16Z","rounded_local_amount":41195.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20359887},{"amount":10.03,"local_amount":40100,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:50:53Z","rounded_local_amount":41195.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27048936},{"amount":10,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:53:30Z","rounded_local_amount":41093,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35940611},{"amount":10.03,"local_amount":40100,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T21:01:47Z","rounded_local_amount":41195.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44398193},{"amount":72.43,"local_amount":289700,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-27T07:41:40Z","rounded_local_amount":297616.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52906019},{"amount":122.48,"local_amount":490000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-24T08:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":503389.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63128095}],"funded_date":"2008-10-22T18:16:45Z","paid_date":"2009-08-24T08:11:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dawn Snider","image":null}},{"id":74580,"name":"San Antonio Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"LAS SOCIAS DEL BANCO COMUNAL \"SAN ANTONIO\" ESTA REPRESENTADO POR LA SE\u00d1ORA MIRTHA QUIEN TIENE NEXO CONSAGUINEO CON LA SE\u00d1ORA MARIA ESTER Y LA SE\u00d1ORA VIVIANA COM PAMELA, PERO CADA UNA D.

They are both in their primary level of education at Barangay Tandul Elementary School. She has managed a typical village store business for almost 9 years now and also sells vegetable in her store. Prior to her current business, Maribel first became a market vendor in their public market of Cabatuan. But due to financial difficulties, Maribel was not able to continue her market vending. Instead, she shifted opening a general store business to still earn a daily income. Now, she is requesting to borrow loan amounting to PHP 10,000 as additional working capital to develop her business towards the education of her children. She hopes to sell more items in her store and be able to develop her business to progress.

D. C. is a 50-year-old widow and the mother of eight children who range in age from six to 27 years old. Her eldest daughter, who has been working abroad, supports her financially and enables her to support the rest of her children, who are dependent on her for their everyday lives. \r\n\r\nTo augment her daughter\u2019s income abroad, early in 2009, Elsie joined ASHI to have access to credit for business capital. Then she opened a variety store. With the profits from her store, she was able to repay her loan on time. \r\n\r\nNow Elsie is requesting another loan from ASHI, which she will use to expand her store and start a new hog-raising business. In the hog business, the profit is as much as double the amount of the initial capital investment when the hogs are sold after months of fattening. So, the more pigs that Elsie can raise and sell, the more profits she will earn. Someday, through the loans she can access from ASHI, Elsie hopes that her business will grow and become profitable enought for her to be able to support all of her children. \r\n\r\nFor now, she has to support the education of her three younger children in high school and elementary school. She hopes that all three will be able to graduate from college.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":386298,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Mohamad is thankful for his work as it allows him to assist with his family's income. \n\nToday, Mohamad is requesting to borrow $1,000 to purchase fishing supplies such as fishing nets and other items before the summer season, which is  considered the high season for the fishers where he could make a good income for the whole year."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":509007,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Fishing supplies ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"LB","country":"Lebanon","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"33.833333 35.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":115,"posted_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohamad","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":249.99,"local_amount":249.99,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":249.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136621060},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144655244},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:09:54Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151837451},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:16:40Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159578170},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:28:33Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166788667},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":83.33,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T12:31:20Z","rounded_local_amount":83.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182484259},{"amount":249.99,"local_amount":249.99,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:12:55Z","rounded_local_amount":249.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195780787},{"amount":83.37,"local_amount":83.37,"processed_date":"2011-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":83.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221609606}],"funded_date":"2010-04-06T20:10:17Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:12:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":190143,"name":"Lucio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Lucio tiene 39 a\u00f1os, es un padre de familia muy trabajador y amoroso.

He lives in a rented house with his wife Leonor, who is 25 years old, and their beloved daughter with the same name, for whom he wants to provide a better life. By working hard, he has been able to make progress for his family. He works at coffee cultivation, but because he does not have his own land, he has to rent it. Together with his wife, they rise very early in order to take care of the coffee plantations, since they know that their income will depend on the good harvest they obtain. Lucio likes his work a lot. He has spent 3 years working in this business and thinks the hardest part is fumigating his plantations, because the chemicals have often affected his health. In time, he hopes to buy his own land and thus save money from renting in order to invest it in fertilizers. This is Lucio's seventh loan with MFP. He has been very timely with his prior loans and expects to do the same with this one.

He sells a variety of merchandise and started this business two years ago.  After finishing his high school education, he found it difficult to secure a job so he decided to generate income by engaging in an independent activity.  His initial market consisted of relatives but gradually he was recommended to other people and today has built a stable customer base that he wants to expand.  Federico sells on credit towels, cleaning implements, pajamas, colognes, cosmetics, and anything else requested by his customers.  This allows him to cover all of the possibilities.  His greatest challenge is being able to respond to his customers in a timely manner.  With each passing day, his operating capital becomes insufficient for satisfying his customers and generating more profits from his sales.  This is why he is applying for a Kiva loan, his first form of financing through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.\r\n<p>\r\nHe will use the money to buy clothes, women\u2019s accessories, and towels so that he can fulfill the orders his customers have made.  With regard to the Day of Love and Friendship (the Colombian equivalent of Valentine\u2019s Day), his customers want to show their affection for relatives and friends with gifts purchased from Federico.  Therefore, he wants to be prepared for the spike in sales and make the most of his loan by injecting operating capital into his business.  Based on his experience, this will increase his chance of success as he takes advantage of this profitable market.

Lilian is 36 years old and a single mother of a son, to whom she gives all the love and care she can.  Lilian told us that she began sewing more than 20 years ago.  She learned from her mother, who she helps and trades work with.  Lilian is a humble person and a very hard worker, thanks to her efforts and the support from the Fundacion Paraguaya, she has been able to gain independence and establish her own sewing shop where her clients come to request different types of clothing.   Lilian makes wedding dresses, blouses, uniforms, etc. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> She would like there to be more opportunities for work in her country because the economic situation for most people is more stable.  In this way, they can avoid more people emigrating to other countries in search of work.  Already many of her clients have left for other countries.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> In recent months, Lilian has received a large quantity of orders, and to be able to complete them she would like to buy thread, fabric, buttons, zippers wholesale, because buying in greater quantities enables her to get better discounts from her suppliers.   To make this happen, she is requesting a loan of $200. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Lilian tiene 36 a\u00f1os, es madre soltera de un hijo var\u00f3n a quien ella brinda todo el amor y cuidados necesarios. \r\nLilian nos cuenta que se inici\u00f3 en el rubro de la costura hace mas de 20 a\u00f1os y lo aprendi\u00f3 de su madre, con quien siempre intercambian trabajos y se ayudan. Ella es una persona muy humilde y trabajadora, gracias a su sacrificio y con el apoyo de los cr\u00e9ditos otorgados por la Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya ella pudo independizarse y establecer su propio taller de costura donde hoy d\u00eda recibe  a sus clientes que solicitan diferentes tipos de trabajos. Ella realiza vestidos de novias, quincea\u00f1eras, camisas, uniformes, etc. \r\nElla desea que en el pa\u00eds existan m\u00e1s fuentes de trabajo para que la situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica de todos sea m\u00e1s estable de esta forma evitar que la gente emigre a otros pa\u00edses en busca de trabajo, ya que muchos de sus clientes emigraron a otros pa\u00edses.\r\nEn los \u00faltimos meses ha recibido una gran cantidad de trabajos, para poder cumplir con todos desea adquirir telas, hilos, botones y cierres al por mayor ya que comprando en grandes cantidades obtiene mejores descuentos de sus proveedores.

With the charcoal business, she has supported all of her children to finish school and start working. She still enjoys selling and takes a lot of pride in serving her customers.

With the money she is requesting she will buy fabric and thread to meet the requests for embroidery that she has; she will buy at wholesale and this way be able to make a greater profit.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":276463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buy supplies for embroidery","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-22T18:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3029.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841958}],"funded_date":"2009-02-22T20:19:58Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Molly Puglisi","image":null}},{"id":95076,"name":"Amina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amina owns a small charcoal store and is a snack vendor in the Ilala neighborhood of Dodoma.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated to expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines.

He is a university student who decided to start a bakery when he had trouble paying for his studies. It was among the students that he acquired such great attention to his business and later he attracted professors and administrative personnel as is primary clients. Whenever there is a birthday celebration, special occasions such as friendship day and Valentine's Day, or when it is the holiday season, he is always sought out for the delicious pastries he makes, especially one made with three different types of milk. He has found his place in this establishment and orders placed have been increasing gradually.\r\n\r\nAs of late he has had a difficult time buying in larger quantities because he doesn't have a substantial working capital. He has approached Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner) for support.  This is his first Kiva loan and his first loan through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. With this loan he will purchase ingredients such as creams, milk products, flour, sugar, grapes, candied fruit, strawberries, etc. His dream is to expand his business and to have other points of sale strategically located, selling products of greater quality made in a cleaner working environment. Mario completes his sales on credit and in cash. His greatest challenge is managing the payments from the clients. The faster he is able to recover his investment he sooner he is able to supply his business and produce more pastries and keep his clientele satisfied.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":699852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase baking ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Cartagena de Indias","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-01-25T16:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mario Andres","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":25,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":64687},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76149},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":77609},{"due_date":"2011-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79096},{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80612},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82157},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":83732},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":85337},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":86972},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":88639},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":90338},{"due_date":"2012-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":104672}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.58},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.88},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.68},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.51},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.19},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.05},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.94},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.69},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":35.58,"local_amount":64687,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:44Z","rounded_local_amount":65587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289232},{"amount":2.13,"local_amount":3865,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:45Z","rounded_local_amount":3918.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157370},{"amount":51.78,"local_amount":94142,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":95452.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230380},{"amount":63.09,"local_amount":114710,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:30Z","rounded_local_amount":116307.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673465},{"amount":55.41,"local_amount":100749,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:56Z","rounded_local_amount":102151.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320022},{"amount":342.01,"local_amount":621847,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:08Z","rounded_local_amount":630506.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263325138}],"funded_date":"2011-01-25T19:12:49Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":272108,"name":"Paula","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Paula es una madre soltera, ella tiene 42 a\u00f1os de edad y reside junto a sus tres hijos en el caser\u00edo Santa Rosa de Curvan, que se encuentra en una zona rural de la localidad de Tambogrande, un distrito agr\u00edcola que se encuentra situado en la regi\u00f3n Piura, a m\u00e1s de cuatro horas de la ciudad de Chiclayo, capital de la regi\u00f3n Lambayeque.\n\nPaula se dedica a la preparaci\u00f3n y venta de alimentos, ella prepara sus alimentos en su domicilio para luego ofrecerlos en venta al p\u00fablico en general.

When her first child was born 12 years ago, and later when the other two were born, she decided to create her own business.  She did this in order to continue generating household income.  Also, she did it so that she would not be away from her family and the work and responsibilities that go with the household.\r\n\r\nIn her business Yegni sells household items, cosmetics, stationery, and everything needed for business.  She is currently applying for a Kiva loan, her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use it to buy household items, women\u2019s accessories, and Christmas decorations.

Together they have two children, 16-year-old Noralei and 10-year-old Jair.  This family lives in their own home, located in the Santa Rosa neighborhood in the town of Puente Paucartambo in the central Peruvian jungle.  For about 10 years, Fortunata has worked in agriculture for a living, with her primary crops being coffee and citrus fruits.  Because of this business, this woman and her family were able to build their own home, and get furniture and electric appliances to furnish it.  All of these achievements were thanks to her coffee crops and her good marketing.  She now also has a business selling soft drinks, beer, and necessities out of her house, which is the only one with a phone in the area.  She says that she is happy with her achievements because she earned everything she has with sweat and hard work.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, Fortunata doesn't stay in one place; she sells the fruits that she produces on her agricultural plots in Lima and, to increase her produce supply, she buys more fruit from her neighbors and from the wholesale market.\r\n\r\nBecause they are eager to move forward, Fortunata and Nila want to see their children become professional people with a good education.  In order to achieve this, they will continue to work and invest in their businesses.  This would be their tenth loan with MFP, which is why they make sure to make their payments on time.

the rural areas of Huancavelica. Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations, being a very mountainous area (altituD. ranges from 6,000 \u2013 17,000 ft above sea level). People there have to contend with the cold, difficulty growing crops, and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.<P>\r\n\r\nCommunity Bank \u201cVencedoras\u201d is located in the community of Locroja in the district with the same name, and province of Churcampa. The main activities of the population are growing corn (lower altitudes), potatoes and wheat (higher altitudes) and raising cows and bulls, guinea-pigs, pigs, and chickens. <P>\r\n\r\nCurrently this community bank has completed its first loan-cycle and just half a year of existence with 11 female borrowers and a total loan of 2,500 soles (about US$ 900). The individual loans range from 100, 200, up to 300 soles. Besides repaying their loans, the group was able to save over 2,100 soles (about US$ 750) during their first loan-cycle and will continue to save in the future. For all members, the main use of the savings is for investing in their business or for the education of their children: to buy school uniforms, supplies, books, and even to pay for entering primary or secondary school.  <P>\r\n\r\nDuring their first loan-cycle, the members have learned many things: to be responsible, to save for future investment, and have received training in a variety of issues. Another thing they like is practicing values like punctuality, responsibility and solidarity.<P>\r\n\r\nOne of the group members, Nieves Aurora B. A., sells vegetables, fruit, and clothes. To earn a little more money, she also raises guinea-pigs and pigs. With her 300 soles loan, she will buy new supplies for her small business. When asked about her future, she tells us that her main dream is for her family to have a better quality of life, that she will be saving for the education of her children so they can be professionals, keep studying, and maybe in the future, even work for an institution like FINCA. What she has learned until now in FINCA is to give a name to her savings, making it easier to save more because she knows exactly why she is saving.<P>\r\n\r\nAna Marcela B., who has a small grocery store in the community and also sells clothes tells a slightly different story.  With her loan of 300 soles, she will be also able to buy more supplies for her store. Her dream for the future is for her children to study and become professionals. Besides that, she wishes to move to the city of Huancayo and build a house there, where she can have a bigger store and earn more. With her savings she wants to buy more supplies. In FINCA she has learned to respect and to be respected by the others, and has learned to save."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":142089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchasing new supplies for their various small businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-03-26T18:01:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes Biviana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nieves Aurora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Serafina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Teofila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aquelina Prudencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlota","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Carmen Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vitaliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emperatriz Yusara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-10T03:38:20Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":416.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":416.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2008-05-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:52:55Z","rounded_local_amount":422.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206678},{"amount":150,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2008-06-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T03:54:05Z","rounded_local_amount":422.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":234526},{"amount":150,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2008-07-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:01:08Z","rounded_local_amount":422.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263245},{"amount":150,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2008-08-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:03:40Z","rounded_local_amount":422.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":292116},{"amount":150,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2008-09-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-11T07:17:25Z","rounded_local_amount":422.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322552},{"amount":150,"local_amount":416.67,"processed_date":"2008-10-10T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:07:27Z","rounded_local_amount":422.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":354899}],"funded_date":"2008-03-27T03:38:20Z","paid_date":"2008-10-13T07:07:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":45920,"name":"Mujeres En Pregreso Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"This partnership from the neighbourhood of Santo Domingo emerged when the members of another group from the same neighbourhood broke up.

Geronimo produces rice every three to four months He earns a net income between PHP10,000 to PHP15,000 every harvest season.  Because of the expensive farm inputs, traders buy their rice products at a lower price. Because of this, he requests a loan of PHP18,000 to support his farming business and to avoid asking credits from traders with higher interest.  He is grateful that he was able to borrow from lenders that offers small interest and creates better opportunities in their lives - thus, helps their family to be free from poverty.  \r\n\t\r\nGeronimo said that through prayers and hard work, his dreams can be achieved someday.  Providing his children their right to education is one of the important things that Geronimo prioritizes. \r\n \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":236953,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase farm inputs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Isabela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T10:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Geronimo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":18000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":18000,"processed_date":"2009-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:07:51Z","rounded_local_amount":18372.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35933477}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T14:55:43Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T10:07:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elrico Mu\u00f1oz","image":279082}},{"id":82804,"name":"Khol's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This small loan is going to three borrowers, all residents of Phnom Penh City.

3 years, and are starting their 6th loan cycle.  Many of the five members of this group sell clothes. They have made enough sales to successfully pay back five loans and have made profits that helped them to improve their quality of life. Each member sells in a different place and they refer customers to one another if a customer is looking for a specific item someone else in the group has for sale.  \r\n<p>\r\nAna R. is the group representative. She is a mother of 5 children.  Selling clothes allows her to have her own income without leaving her home for extended periods at a time. The loans she has taken out have enabled her to purchase merchandise in larger quantities and of better quality.

Her economic activity for more than 30 years has been selling pork.  She started her business thinking about the well-being of her children, and the idea arose because of a friend\u2019s suggestion.  Together, they visited the villages to sell their product.  Over time, she learned how to butcher the pigs and how to make nacatamales (a local dish) from her friend.  The loan she requests is for working capital to buy pigs and dough, ingredients, and other items.  Her wish is to buy enough pigs to generate more income.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

V. is 26 years old and is married with one child.  She and her husband work together in the timber business.  They live in the city of Pucallpa.  \r\n\r\nMitsi has been working with Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for about a year and a half and is a member of the communal bank \u201cLas Triunfadoras\u201d (The Winners).  She invested her very first loan of 300 soles (about $100) in the sale of condiments, a business that she had at that time.  Nowadays, Mitsi is working full time with her husband in the timber business.

She is single and has grown-up children who are independent. She has a law degree but is not using it fully.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community.  Eteli has been engaged in this business for over 2 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Eteli joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Eteli has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  Eteli is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST which will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  This will be the 2nd loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Eteli plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:<P>\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.

She is starting a business venture, planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Va  needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 200 tala or US $83 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Va  joined SPBD. This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Va 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Va F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.78 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Emelia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Emelia is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the third loan taken out by Emelia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About HSPFI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Arcilla is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be Arcilla\u2019s 4th loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She hopes to save enough of the money from this loan to upgrade the studio\u2019s sound system once the business gets through the first few startup months.  For supplemental income, Andrea rents out the studio for special events such as baby showers.\n\nAndrea loves seeing the physical and mental transformation her students undergo as they take her classes.  She hopes to eventually expand her studio and carry workout apparel.  Andrea likes owning her own business, despite finding it stressful.  \u201cBeing your own boss is good because you can organize your time the way you want it.  But at the same time, it brings a lot of responsibility\u2026it is a challenge.\u201d  Andrea is married with a 16-year-old son.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5500,"image":{"id":765520,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

She lives with her husband and children in a large traditional family in the city of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). \r\n\r\nHaving attempted several activities without success, Salimata became involved in the storage and sale of grain (maize, millet, sorghum, etc.) over seven years ago. She has her own shop in Kabo\u00efla I.\r\n\r\nEager to better serve her growing customer base, she joined the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso about six years ago. After five group loans in collaboration with a local women\u2019s group (the Kotognogontala Association of Banconi), she is now seeking her eighth individual loan. All previous loans were repaid without problems. \r\n\r\nWith this new loan, she plans to purchase 25 sacks of maize, 15 sacks of millet and 15 sacks of sorghum. She buys her stock in various communities surrounding Sikasso, and then sells the merchandise wholesale or at retail to a clientele consisting mostly of household heads.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that this loan will help her earn a monthly profit of 275,000 FCFA, which she will use primarily to increase her working capital, help with the household expenses, and pay the interest on the loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":884699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to stock up on grain for resale ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-10-06T00:03:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.66},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:04Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699275},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:19Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655551},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874343},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283164},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424673},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:50Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270139939},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2012-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-19T08:34:02Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276756928},{"amount":116.66,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2012-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:10Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251705},{"amount":116.67,"local_amount":55555.52,"processed_date":"2012-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":56400.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410751}],"funded_date":"2011-10-11T22:17:02Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":345912,"name":"Nidal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nidal is a 42-year-old single woman from Lebanon.

She is very concientious with her customers and thanks to the flavor and variety of the dishes, she has been able to attract a loyal public.\r\nLinda has had this profitable business for the past 2 years.  Thanks to her effort she has been able to get her children ahead.  The 2 oldest are studying at the university but they still help her in the restaurant.\r\nAs a woman thinking ahead, she would like to enlarge her space a few years from now, and add more tables.  Not only making the food on the menu, but also because of  the late hours, Linda needs a lot of help.  This will be the first time that Linda has applied for a loan with MFP, and that is why she promises to make all the monthly payments on time.  She feels very good with the newly formed communal bank that she hopes will show progress.  She will use the money to buy glass for the tables, new tablecloths, have a plumber fix her dishwasher, paint the walls, and if there is any money left, she will buy drinks.

Several work as laborer has been tried, however the income was not enough to support ever increasing family needs. Finally Komang Muriada follows his parents footsteps to work as a farmer. He works on the 40 are (about 4000 square meters) land owned by his parents with Dinari's loan. Komang Muriada started this new work since last year. As with othe farmers in his village, Komang Muriada also plants long bean vegetables on the land. From working the land, planting seeds, fertilized it, to spraying was done by Komang Muriada himself. During harvest time Komang Muriada is getting help from his wife and 2 daily laborers at a rate of Rp20,000 (about US$2.20)\/day. In one plucking day harvest, Komang Muriada could make about 100 bunches (about 1 kg\/bunch), which he sold for Rp2500-Rp3000 (about 30-35 cents). This was done once every two days. Long beans could be pluck about 25-30X per period (3 months).  Within a period Komang Muriada could produce about Rp 6,000,000 (about US$660) in income. After subtracting Expenses for fertilizers, pesticides, labor cost, etc his net profit is Rp2,050,000 (about US$220)\/ 3 months. This makes Komang Muriada more enthusiastic in doing his work.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nDengan hanya memiliki Ijazah SMP dan ketrampilan yang pas-pasan,  tak cukup bagi I Komang Muriada untuk mendapatkan pekerjaan di lembaga formal maupun perusahaan swasta. Apalagi semenjak menikah dengan Putu Putri Ariani, tanggung jawabnya semakin bertambah  karena harus menghidupi istri dan dua orang anak.Untuk itu Komang Muriada harus berusaha keras untuk mendapatkan penghasilan yang menunjang kelangsungan hidup keluarga. Berbagai  pekerjaan sebagai buruh sudah di cobanya, namun hasilnya tak cukup untuk memenuhi kebutuhan rumah tangganya yang semakin meningkat. Sehingga akhirnya Komang Muriada harus mengikuti jejak orang tuanya terjun sebagai petani . Menggarap tanah seluas 40 Are milik orang tua dan dengan  modal pinjaman dari Dinari, Komang Muriada memulai  menekuni pekerjaan barunya sejak tahun lalu . Seperti halnya petani lain di desanya Komang muriada juga menanami tanah garapannya dengan tanaman sayuran yaitu kacang panjang. Dari mengolah tanah,  menanam bibit , memupuk dan menyemprot di kerjakan Komang Muriada sendiri . Sedangkan pada waktu musim panen Komang Muriada di bantu oleh istri dan juga ada dua orang tenaga buruh yang di bayar harian sebesar Rp 20.000,-  . Dalam sekali petik hasil panen, Komang Muriada bisa mencapai 100 ikat ( beratnya kurang lebih 1 kg) , yang per ikat nya di jual Rp. 2.500,- s\/d Rp. 3.000.,-  Itu dilakukan tiap dua hari sekali . Tanaman kacang panjang bisa dipanen sebanyak 20 s\/d 25 kali dalam satu periode ( 3 Bulan ) Dalam satu periode Komang Muriada mendapat hasil produksi sebesar Rp. 6.000.000,-   dan keuntungan yang di peroleh setelah di potong biaya bibit, pupuk , obat-obatan , ongkos buruh dan lain-lain  adalah sebesar Rp.  2.050.000,- \/ tiga bulan . Hasil ini membuat  Komang Muriada semakin semangat untuk menekuni pekerjaannya itu."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":75623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy long bean seeds, fertilizer, pesticides and maintenance upkeep\r\n<p>Membeli bibit kacang panjang, pupuk, obat - obatan dan biaya perawatan","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-16T21:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"I Komang Muriada","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-31T04:30:31Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-11-05T01:29:05Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T10:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":76340},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T02:50:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T10:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":88547},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T02:47:51Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T10:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100341},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:35:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T10:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119146},{"amount":67,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T01:18:05Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T10:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":139733},{"amount":65,"local_amount":65,"processed_date":"2008-03-26T06:10:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-26T10:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166037}],"funded_date":"2007-10-17T04:30:31Z","paid_date":"2008-03-26T06:10:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":25453,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is a small entrepreneur owning a pharmacy shop.

The majority run commercial enterprises from their own homes where they sell groceries or clothing or chupas (a chewy bread snack). They are all neighbours and are now in the third cycle of the women\u2019s program. Each person receives an average of G.600.000 of credit.<p>\r\n\r\nThe formation of the group was largely due to the efforts of Sra. Gasparina P. who invited her neighbours to participate. They soon became interested in the women\u2019s program and so began the first meetings. The group\u2019s objective currently is the activities associated with the San Juan festival where they plan to sell local dishes and use the money they earn to add to their own savings.<p>\r\n\r\nOne of the characteristics of the members of this group is the high level of observance of the rules that govern the program. This is demonstrated by the regular repayment of the loan and by punctual attendance at the weekly meetings. They are also very strict about members who miss meetings without good reason, and the guilty are given warnings.<p>\r\n\r\nGasparina notes that the success of an undertaking is due in large part to good organisation and discipline. For these reasons she is very grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya which, as well as helping the group raise capital, also provides an advisor to assist with training and the administrative tools necessary to run a group business.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer.<b\/><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEl comit\u00e9 est\u00e1 compuesto por 15 se\u00f1oras trabajadoras de la compa\u00f1\u00eda Yaka Roysa de la ciudad de Caacup\u00e9, gran parte de las se\u00f1oras se dedican a actividades comerciales que lo explotan en su mismo domicilio, como  despensas, chiperas, vendedoras de ropas, entre otras, todas son vecinas, actualmente y est\u00e1n en el 3 ciclo del programa comit\u00e9 de mujeres y reciben un promedio de G. 600.000 por persona en cr\u00e9dito.<p>\r\n\r\nLa  conformaci\u00f3n del grupo se debi\u00f3 a la gran colaboraci\u00f3n que brindo la se\u00f1ora Gasparina P., quien fue la que comenz\u00f3 inicialmente con las invitaciones a sus vecinas quienes r\u00e1pidamente mostraron inter\u00e9s por el programa de comit\u00e9 de mujeres.

He lives with his wife and his son in a house he owns.  He offers internet access to the public.  Because he is close to a school, most of his customers are children and young people who attend the school.  He has had this business for two years: he manages and attends to his business alone.  What he likes best about his work is interacting with the young people who ask for his help.  The business is very profitable because he has loyal customers and his internet stations are always busy.

She is married with six children all between the ages of 13 and 18 \r\n<p>\r\nSalimiti has run a poultry business since 2003.  Raising Kuku (chicken in Swahili) is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients.  They require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally!  They require little space, so you can just let them run around in your garden or compound.  While they grow they produce eggs, which can be sold to supplement her income or eaten to provide a source of protein.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe works at the business 12 hours a day, seven days per week and is assisted by one employee.  Salimiti earns about $140 from her business.  She requests a loan of $400 to purchase more chickens. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Salimiti thanks you for your support!\r\n<p>\r\n--------------------------------\r\nABOUT SELFINA\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":336944,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase chickens.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-06-16T00:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salimiti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:02Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233218},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:54:17Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73665011},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:47:52Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105723},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:38Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022833},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:42:28Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868074},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:03Z","rounded_local_amount":87666.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757270}],"funded_date":"2009-06-16T00:52:49Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Allen","image":1340661}},{"id":119684,"name":"Paula Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Paula Elizabeth R.

Anahaw, Hinigaran Negros Occidental. She is 35 years old and married to Eulogio B., who is presently employed as Kabo (supervisor) in a sugarcane plantation. They have an adopted child, Jasmine, who is eight years old. The couple is still hoping to have their own baby someday. Even though she has a small family, Vivian still prepares for their future. She still helps her husband raise their weekly income. \r\n\r\nThe family has their own small rice farm that supports the food needs of the family. This gave Vivian the idea to make the rice field more productive. In the year 2002 she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to have capital for her farm to buy seeds and fertilizer and to pay for labor. Since the rice is harvested after three months, Vivian worked in the sugarcane plantation in the meantime. After harvesting the rice, she had it milled and sold it to the people in her community and also to the sugarcane workers. The rice business earns an average of PHP 4,000 per month, which is enough for her small family, with savings left for their future security.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of Php 17,000 was used as working capital for her farm. She paid all of her weekly installments on time and the loan was fully paid within the loan term, maintaining her status as a good member of NWTF_Project Dungganon. Now she is borrowing Php 19,000 to add to her capital for her rice farm to have a better living standard in the future.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon.

She runs her business out of her home and sells sweets, bread and other food items like fruit juice.  This will be her fourth loan with Esperanza after successfully paying back her previous three loans.  She plans to use this loan to purchase food items to sell and ingredients so she can make items to sell.  She specifically needs flour, rice, sugar, oil, eggs and butter.  \r\n\r\nMaria wants to continue to improve her living conditions by working hard and advancing her family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing general alteration and tailoring services to community members for clothing such as dresses and school uniforms. Leah has been engaged in her business for more than 4 years and earns approximately 10,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month for these activities. The picture above was taken outside her house where a garden of flowers is located.\r\n\r\nLeah joined HSPFI in 2010 to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5000 PHP from HSPFI, which was used to to purchase tailoring equipment such as needles and thread. Leah is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fabrics and other materials. This will be her second loan from HSPFI. Leah plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and\/or expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHagdan sa Pag-uswag Foundation, Inc.

With the blows life was giving her at that time, and in a foreign country, she saw the necessity of returning to Paraguay, to start all over again from zero.\r\n\r\n<p>She started out selling merchandise in the street. At that time she had just one big bag which she carried on her back, going from house to house offering her products. In this way she made working capital and, little by little, with much sacrifice, her business kept growing. She had the chance to buy a new house and in that way raise her 5 children and offer them a good education. Today, she already has a good quantity of customers, and thanks to her effort and the support of her children, she is able to open a small business inside her own home.\r\n\r\n<p>With the loan she is requesting, she plans to expand her stock of merchandise.

She also says that she has grown a lot, but now with the rise in prices it is more difficult to sell fish, because before with the capital she had she was able to buy tons of fish and now she can only buy kilos so this is her greatest challenge.\r\n\r\nWith this loan for S\/.3,000, which will be repaid in 6 months, she will buy specifically with this entire loan, fish, because she tells us that each case costs S\/.96 and it is necessary to invest a lot.\r\n\r\nRaquiel mentions that she would like to educates herself to improve her business and also her personal life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":226413,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Yungay - Ancash","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.166667 -77.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:46Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Raquiel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:40:49Z","rounded_local_amount":502.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951795},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":502.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224841},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:43:20Z","rounded_local_amount":502.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417563},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":502.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27111009},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":502.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36006331},{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:39:55Z","rounded_local_amount":502.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590219}],"funded_date":"2008-12-24T07:39:54Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:39:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":78740,"name":"Mustafokul","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"S.

She is a 53-year-old married mother of two children, both grown up. Out of the need to make headway for her children and thanks to her enterprising spirit and energy, she decided to start her own business selling food in a well-conditioned space out of her home, where she also provides a boardinghouse. Lisbith tells us that she started with 200 soles of capital and little by little she saved and it grew each day. She wakes up very early to prepare her meals. She tends to her boarders with the charisma and tasty foods she is known for. With this loan of 1,000 soles, she plans to set up a small kitchen area where she can make her meals and also purchase cooking utensils to provide better service. She plans to use part of the money to purchase rice, sugar and other products of primary need. Lisbith feels very safe and has a strong desire to keep moving forward to assure herself of a peaceful life.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

All of the women work at making and selling chipas [a traditional cheese bread] on a large scale. All of them work in their own homes making the products and later they go out to various points of the city of Asuncion to sell them. \r\n\r\nPreviously, the women's committee program worked commercially but in a smaller scale. That is why these days, with the formation of the business women's committee, there is an attitude of belonging from keeping up with the requirements that the committee makes of them.  \r\n\r\nOne of the women is Miguela, who, with the help of her whole family, makes her delicious chipas every day starting very early, since she has to deliver the orders to the resalers. With her her family, she works very hard. She wants very much to get ahead, especially since her children are studying for their professions. In this way she is improving her income and her quality of life.  She is asking for this loan to purchase ingredients to make her product, such as starch, cheese, oil, squash and others. \r\n\r\nThe loan will facilitate the work and increase the capital that each woman has. In this way, they will be able to satisfy their needs, investing in their small businesses that will generate more income for the family unit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4350,"image":{"id":526923,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase ingredients for chipas, such as: starch, yucca starch, cheese, squash, and corn meal.

with her husband (who appears in the photo) and their three children, who are between the ages of 6 and 10. She earns a living by selling a variety of merchandise, including cosmetics and clothing. She also has another business selling pork and chicken by the pound, which brings in a good amount of money. Lucy is creative and entrepreneurial and started these businesses to help her husband support the family, which he used to do by himself before she became an independent worker. She started out with just a little money and offers her goods on credit, so she's turning to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to ask for a Kiva loan.

He is the father of two children aged 18 and 20 and he lives together with them and his wife in his own home.  Gerler is about to start a project that he has had in mind for a long time.  He has always wanted to have a restaurant near his home but he currently works in a poultry store.  During all the years that he has worked, he has always saved up so that he can eventually achieve his goal.  However, he is still lacking some money.  He and his wife will start working together selling fried chicken from a small stall on the corner outside their home.  He hopes to be able to achieve big things in this new business. \r\n\r\nThis will be Gerler's first loan from MFP and he is certain that he will be able to make his repayments without problems.  He will use the sum he has requested to buy a stove and some utensils so that he can start work in his own business that he has wished for for so long."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":865210,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a stove and utensils","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-11T12:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gesler ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":146.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":156.41},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":161.32},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":171.53},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":177.88},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":186.11}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.03},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.49},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.32},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.71},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.03,"local_amount":146.75,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:06Z","rounded_local_amount":150.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851271},{"amount":58.66,"local_amount":156.41,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666454},{"amount":60.49,"local_amount":161.32,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:22Z","rounded_local_amount":165.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621606},{"amount":64.32,"local_amount":171.53,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":175.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835689},{"amount":136.5,"local_amount":363.99,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":372.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283203184}],"funded_date":"2011-09-29T11:41:51Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:28:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":337738,"name":"Rosario","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosario is 64 years old and lives in P-1 Embargo, Ozamiz City.
