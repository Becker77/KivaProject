It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Leonor is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Leonor from ASKI.

Talacdan, Cauayan, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  buying and selling charcoal\/firewood, and selling rice. Her husband, Leonardo, who is 62 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between 26 and 36 years old. \r\n\r\nFlorencia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Florencia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,300, uplifting the family's standard of living.

She has 3 children who are between 27 and 30 years old, One has family and the other 2 are working. \r\n\r\nMa. Luisa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Luisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,500 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 15,000 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing 29,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more stocks of rice and beer so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs. \r\n\r\nMa. Luisa is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

This business consists of cattle-raising in his village because there is a very high demand for milk from villagers and especially from customers who come from enclosed towns. Tulkunjon is helped by his wife. \r\n<p>\r\nTulkunjon is currently faced with many problems because his children are growing and, accordingly, their expenses are growing too. The only way to get out of this difficulty is to succeed in business, so we hope that his capabilities and services provided by IMON International will help him improve the business. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes being a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her eldest son works in Russia doing odd jobs at a construction site. Her eldest daughter works as a seamstress in Alamedin market in the capital. Her second son is an excavator, and her youngest daughter is a college student at the Humanities University in the capital. \r\n<p>\r\nSuyunbubu prefers to be independent from her children and earns her living by manufacturing curtains and tailoring.

With their help, Suyunbubu manages to get her work done faster. She has her own sewing machine and does all her work at home. However, she is in need of a new sewing machine as her current one has become old and inconvenient. She also needs to purchase some accessories for the sewing machine.

The town has several approaches but the easiest and nearest is via the Mexico-Oaxaca highway.  When you reach the turn-off marked \u201cTlayecac-Amayuca\u201d turn right and follow that road all the way to the town of Tlayecac.  Agriculture is the main activity in this town, especially corn and sorghum, which is cultivated by 195 farmers on 1234 hectares.  The most common livestock is sheep, pigs and goats.  Among other important activities is commerce because the industrial zone that provides employment in the region is located here; the distance to the municipal seat is 135km.  This town is home to the Tlayecac communal bank in which most of the members are engaged in commerce.  This group is in its ninth loan cycle with FUNDACION REALIDAD although they took a couple of cycles off because sales were low and they preferred to wait so they have just now gotten their 9th loan in order to stock up for the December season.  Ambrosia M. Z. has been a group member since its founding in 2006.  She is married and has 4 children, two of whom are students and two are employed.  She requested 6000 pesos this cycle which will be invested in her grocery store to buy eggs, milk, chicken, bread, sugar, salt, soft-drinks, Sabritas, etc.  Her business is located at #28 24 de febrero street in Tlayecac.  She tells us that she has over 200 customers per day because her store is on one of the main avenues and near CECYTE (State-run technological high-schools) so many students stop by to buy from her.  She relates that her business has faced some challenges but they haven\u2019t caved in and have continued forward despite having a store open across the street from her two years ago.  At first, the competition cut all its prices so all her customers went there but, eventually, that store went bankrupt and her customers returned to her.  Her greatest wish is to open another store on another one of Tlayecac\u2019s streets that she can leave to her grandson, who is still a little boy, but who is her main purpose in life and her motivation to continue working because her daughter is a single mother and Ambrosia supports her in every way.  Finally, she is grateful to Fundacion Realidad for continuing to believe in them and for letting them return, having taken some time off, without any problems.  She is also grateful to Kiva for helping the Fundacion so that it can continue to help people who truly need credit in order to see their businesses grow.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":435847,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy eggs, milk, sugar, soft-drinks, Sabritas (Frito-Lay-type snacks), etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TLAYECAC MORELOS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2009-12-11T00:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dominga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ambrosia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yadira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Luisa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sebastiana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maleny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":27000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1687.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1687.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":656.25,"local_amount":8437.5,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":8458.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110686028},{"amount":532.4,"local_amount":6845.2,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:51Z","rounded_local_amount":6862.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118080361},{"amount":537.62,"local_amount":6912.28,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:15:25Z","rounded_local_amount":6929.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123916682},{"amount":373.73,"local_amount":4805.02,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":4816.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128952413}],"funded_date":"2009-12-15T22:57:10Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:06:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":165460,"name":"Budragchaa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Budragchaa is 50 years old and lives with his wife and three children in Zavkhan province, Mongolia.

He is in a common law marriage and has a 10 year old daughter who goes to school. He went to school until 5th grade but didn't finish due to his parents' lack of conditions. He lives in his own house and helps his parents who live in Inhambane by sending them 500 meticais worth of groceries every three months. \r\n\r\nFrederico moved to the Namaacha District definitively when he started working mining precious stones in Pedra Lage. Due to the distance, he brought his family to live close to him and his work. He left his job and started a retail business because the mining equipment were precarious and that demanded a lot from him. He currently owns a store at his house where he sells staples (beans, peanuts, stock). He travels twice a week and takes 5,000 meticais with him and makes 2,000 meticais in profit, which he applies towards household expenses. \r\n\r\nThis is Frederico's second loan with Hluvuku and first with Kiva, in the amount of 8,000 meticais. He intends to buy products (peanuts, beans, cooking oil, seasonings and others) to increase his inventory. The previous loan was for 5,000 meticais went to his business. \r\n\r\nHe is very happy to have met the expectations of keeping his business. He will pay the loan back ahead of time and request another one to build a store and stop selling informally. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Betyna

They have three children - Meksi, Putra, and Daniel. Meksi is 15 years old and is in the 3rd grade of Junior high school. Putra is 10 years old and is in the 2nd grade of Elementary school. Daniel is 5 years old and is not at school yet. Frangky and family live in the village of Pariti, which is about 35 km from the Kupang City. \r\n\r\nIn order to meet his family's needs, Frengky runs a shrimp business. Usually he goes to sea in the afternoon around 2 pm when the weather is good and returns home at 2 am in the following day. Frengky usually uses a trawl for catching the shrimp. In a day, Frengky can drag about 2 to 3 kg of shrimp, and he sells the shrimp at about IDR 35,000 to 55,000 per kg. However, his trawl is currently broken and Frengky does not have enough money to mend it. As a result, he cannot go to catch shrimp.\r\n\r\nFrengky tried to farm in addition to catch shrimp. He planted cabbage in a small quantity due to the limited fund that he had. Of 100 seedlings of cabbage planted, 60 of them grow and can be harvested after 3 weeks. One cabbage is sold at IDR 4,000 at the traditional market in Camplong. Frengky sees that the result of farming cabbage is quite promising for the future and so he intends to seek for a loan to support him improving the businesses.\r\n\r\nFrengky is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 10,000,000 from TLM. He plans to spend the loan on cabbage seeds, to fix the trawl and to buy a chainsaw to be leased. If the capital is still sufficient then he also plans to buy piglets for breeding. He really expects the loan can improve his family life in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":729486,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to

They enjoy working together and are excited to access a loan.  \r\nThe women that comprise the Girasol II group raise livestock for a living. They buy and sell cows and bulls of different ages. Some of them sell the grown animal while others butcher it and sell the meat to butcher shops. They raise the cattle over a period of time and have established a business cycle.  Most of their families have other means of income apart from raising livestock and dedicate a part of their land for grazing purposes. \r\n<P> Despite the rise in the price of a grown cow or bull from 300 to 800 USD, purchasing calves and raising them involve substantial costs. The animals are raised for 7 to 8 months. Since raising cattle involves an initial investment, being able to access loans is very important.  Loans give these families a safety net which allows them to invest in feed, corn and vitamins for the cattle. \r\n\r\n\r\n<P>The credit has allowed them to grow their business and investments bit by bit. Most of these women began with small loans of under 50 USD.  Today, they borrow and repay loans that are on average from 300 to 400 USD.\r\n<P>Reyna G. began her micro-enterprise raising and selling chicken.  Currently, she is raising half a dozen of her own cattle. She described her venture as separate from her husband\u2019s affairs.  She takes out the loan, raises the cattle, sells the meat and repays the loans after making a profit. The loans provide her with the flexibility to maintain her own cattle business while raising three children. \r\n\r\n<P>Money is on these womens' minds very often, so that they can support a happy, healthy and prosperous family. Their livelihood is contingent upon having the peace of mind that there is cash to cover expenses while they build a sustainable business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3275,"image":{"id":175768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase vitamins, cattle feed and other fencing equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santa Catarina Ixtahuacan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.8 -91.366667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2008-06-29T05:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3275,"lender_count":104,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Izabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sebastiana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-15T03:25:08Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":24500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":3275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2722.22},{"due_date":"2008-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2722.22},{"due_date":"2008-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2722.22},{"due_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2722.22},{"due_date":"2008-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2722.22},{"due_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2722.22},{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2722.22},{"due_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2722.22},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2722.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":363.89},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":363.89},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":363.89},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":363.89},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":363.89},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":363.89},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":363.89},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":363.89},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":363.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":364,"local_amount":2723.05,"processed_date":"2008-08-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:12:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2743.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":296749},{"amount":364,"local_amount":2723.05,"processed_date":"2008-09-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-01T07:09:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2743.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":327366},{"amount":364,"local_amount":2723.05,"processed_date":"2008-10-15T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-22T08:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2743.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":360872},{"amount":363.56,"local_amount":2719.73,"processed_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-19T09:05:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2740.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5315863},{"amount":363.89,"local_amount":2722.22,"processed_date":"2008-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-19T09:11:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2742.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9934044},{"amount":363.89,"local_amount":2722.22,"processed_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:16:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2742.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14857879},{"amount":363.89,"local_amount":2722.22,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-18T08:05:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2742.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20398597},{"amount":363.89,"local_amount":2722.22,"processed_date":"2009-03-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:18:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2742.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27090526},{"amount":363.88,"local_amount":2722.24,"processed_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-22T08:14:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2742.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35983909}],"funded_date":"2008-07-01T03:25:08Z","paid_date":"2009-05-22T08:14:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":58677,"name":"Josephine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Josephine is 22 years old.

Thanks to the group training sessions given by her group\u2019s loan officer, Valentina has improved her business. With this loan, Valentina plans to buy more gas canisters for her business. Her dream is to open a large store and for her children to graduate with professional degrees. She plans to use her savings to help two of her children get their degrees. \r\n\r\nVicenta C. is married and has six children. She sells firewood and dry goods from a tent, since her house is still under construction. Vicenta suffered through the death of her 18-year old daughter which left her depressed.

She is 60 years old, but still strong and able to manage her business. She is a widow with three children aging between 23 to 37 years old, all of whom have already finished their studies through the help of NWTF-Project Dungganon. Two of her children have their own families and her youngest son is the only one left living with her. He helps her with all household and other work. Despite being old, she is still very happy because her dreams have come true that all of her children have finished college, and are still earning their living.\r\n\r\nBefore she started as an NWTF-Project Dungganon member, she already had her business which helps support her family and pay for her children's education. She is engaged in running her general store, purchase and sales of rice, running a coffee shop, and pig fattening. This business was run by herself with the help of her husband and children. But unfortunately her husband died. But her life and business continues, and is also a source of leisure for her to forget what happened to her husband. When she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon her businesses brought more comfort to the family because it doubled her earnings to sustain her children. Even in her age, she continues her loans and businesses, in fact she was able to earn Php 6,000 per month, a big help to her children, and she is also maintaining good credit performance in NWTF-PD. \r\n\r\nPreviously she borrowed Php 15,000 for additional capital for her business. The said amount was paid in full and on time. Now, she is borrowing the same amount, Php 15,000, to be used as additional capital, and any income from it will be used to expand the business.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few, but thousands of women.

One frustration for Gloria and her husband is that their children only attained a low level of education.\r\n<p>\r\nA good thing is that their two sons are now working abroad, so they will be able to send their children to school until college. Naturally, Gloria and Aurelio don\u2019t want their children to experience what they experienced in the past. Gloria, in her own little way, helps their children to make their dream possible for her grandchildren. She has run a variety store business for seven years, and she really wants this to continue and to grow more.\r\n\r\nIn 2002 she joined the Kiva field partner, Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), and as a member she is entitled to loans. Every loan that she received in the past years of being a member was always used in improving her variety store business. Now her loan will be used to expand her business, because she will buy all the necessary things needed by her business like sacks of rice, different groceries and many more.\r\n\r\nShe is hoping that her business will grow so that they can turn it into a grocery store that can sell more things than a variety store. In that way, she could help her children in sending their children to school, and also help themselves improve their

The loan proceeds will be used to expand their offerings through purchasing additional goods such as household items and a variety of foodstuffs such as sugar, beans, rice, etc.\r\n\r\nThe members of Twitezimbere hope that the new range of products will appeal to their current customers as well as attract new customers to their store. All of this should result in a greater profit for their enterprise. With this profit, the members of Twitezimbere will continue to pay school fees for their children and build a secure future for their families and loved ones.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":435074,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional goods, household items and foodstuffs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Kabuga","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T09:40:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Clementine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jacqueline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gady","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T18:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":84907.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110782280},{"amount":150,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":84907.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118169382},{"amount":150,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:45Z","rounded_local_amount":84907.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124008373},{"amount":150,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84907.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129037603},{"amount":150,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":84907.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136760273},{"amount":150,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:44Z","rounded_local_amount":84907.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":145022705}],"funded_date":"2009-12-03T20:24:37Z","paid_date":"2010-06-17T08:10:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":161349,"name":"Ellen","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Ellen A. is from the town of Calamba, Misamis Occidental.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

three business ventures:  selling Ready-to-Wear (RTW) clothes, raising livestock and food vending. She lives in Purok 6, Brgy. Cubay, La Carlota City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her RTW sales, livestock and food vending businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of 7,200 PHP. Suzette is now borrowing 15,000 PHP to sustain and grow her businesses. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 12,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Suzette aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She lives in Prk. Pag-asa, Brgy. Port Barton, San Vicente, Palawan. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2008 and has improved her living conditions with the help of loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She currently earns an average monthly income of 18000 PHP. Zita is now borrowing 24000 PHP so that she can purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 7th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 19500 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Zita aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is married and has 4 children, all of whom are in school.  She also takes care of her late sister\u2019s children.    \n\nZaituni has a business selling fruits and vegetables.  She has been in this business for 9 years, and works 7 days out of every week.  Zaituni sells her products at the market by means of retail.   She also generates additional income by selling charcoal.\n\nZaituni has requested a loan of 1500000 Ugandan Shillings from MCDT SACCO to buy more mangoes, pineapples, oranges, cabbages and onions. The main business challenges for Zaituni include transportation, thieves, and seasonality.

","en":"Mrs. Severina Q. G. is 60 years old and was married but her husband traveled to Spain to work 15 years ago and she has not heard from him since. She has 1 daughter, 19 years old, who is the mother of an 8 month old girl, who studys hairdressing in the city and helps with the constant care of the cows at night. Mrs. Severina lives in Central Maica of the Cochabamba community, where she has 3 cows whose milk is produced and sold in different markets of the city of Cochabamba. Mrs Severina has been selling milk and cheeses, known in the area for its excellent quality, for more than 40 years. \r\n\r\nThe loan will be used to purchase food for her livestock (Chall and soybeans) because the drought increased the cost of the same lot and she does not have enough to buy all the food the cows need. With the loan she would have no problem continuing to produce the same amount of milk that she already produces, nor would the quantity and quality of the cheese decrease. Mrs. Severina hopes to be able to get another loan after this to buy hairdressing equipment for her daughter so that she can work in hairdressing and earn money to improve her standard of living and that of her8 month old daughter.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Pamela Reynolds, Kiva

She is 47 years old. Annabelle is married and has five grown children. To make a living, Annabelle operates a food stall. The main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of fruit products in the local community. Annabelle has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 6,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Annabelle joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Annabelle has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Annabelle is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Annabelle from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is starting a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Fiapaipai needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or US $104 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Fiapaipai joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Fiapaipai's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Fiapaipai N. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. Known for its epic mountain passes, the country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous, leaving only 7 percent of arable land. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nEdward B. S. is the leader of this group of teachers. The 60-year-old was born in Mabonkani village. He is married to a teacher and they have five children.  Edward, who has been a teacher for thirty-eight years, is requesting a loan of SLL 1,500,000 in order to pay school fees and other school-related charges for his children. \r\n\r\n(Attached to this photo is the snapshot of a borrower who was not able to be present for the group photo.)\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":517417,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Pay school fees and school-related charges for his children","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edward B.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agnes Y.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Philip ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicolas M.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":360000},{"due_date":"2010-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":360000},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":360000},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":360000},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":360000},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":360000},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":360000},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":360000},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":360000},{"due_date":"2011-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":360000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":95,"local_amount":360000,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:10:31Z","rounded_local_amount":368394.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136737162},{"amount":190,"local_amount":720000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:59:26Z","rounded_local_amount":736789.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144770534},{"amount":95,"local_amount":360000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:15:40Z","rounded_local_amount":368394.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151952885},{"amount":95,"local_amount":360000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:57:42Z","rounded_local_amount":368394.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159692390},{"amount":95,"local_amount":360000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:54:42Z","rounded_local_amount":368394.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166906597},{"amount":95,"local_amount":360000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:39:00Z","rounded_local_amount":368394.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172174460},{"amount":190,"local_amount":720000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:35:19Z","rounded_local_amount":736789.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182608519},{"amount":95,"local_amount":360000,"processed_date":"2011-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:32:15Z","rounded_local_amount":368394.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191485722}],"funded_date":"2010-04-02T11:37:13Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T05:32:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":194756,"name":"Chizi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Chizi N. is a businesswoman who has operated a food kiosk for the last 12 years.

That will allow her to increase her production and furthermore deliver her tailored garments faster. She is able to serve a wide range of clients from her home. In the future, she is looking to expand her business and eventually open her own tailoring shop.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns a minimum of 300 PHP in sales every day.     \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 13,000 PHP loan.

Cuando era joven no le gustaba el cultivo de la tierra, pero desde que se enamor\u00f3 y se cas\u00f3 con un agricultor su trabajo se torn\u00f3 netamente al labrado de esta, sembrando pl\u00e1tanos, pi\u00f1as y mayormente caf\u00e9. Cuando aun sus hijos eran muy peque\u00f1os, junto a su esposo doblegaban esfuerzos, pero ahora que ya han crecido, los ayudan realizando una faena y de ese modo aminoran sus d\u00edas en la chacra. Entonces se organizan para la comercializaci\u00f3n del caf\u00e9 en los diversos mercados en busca de un buen precio, esta din\u00e1mica les permite captar mayores ingresos para su hogar, puesto que mientras que ellos est\u00e1n vendiendo sus productos, sus hijos est\u00e1n trabajando en sus tierras. Con las ganancias acumuladas pueden cubrir los gastos de educaci\u00f3n; tanto del colegio de los menores, como el instituto t\u00e9cnico de los mayores que est\u00e1n en otras ciudades fuera de su pueblo.

El dinero solicitado planea utilizarlo en la compra de 18 sacos de nitrato (abono), en busca de mejores resultados en sus cultivos de caf\u00e9. ","en":"Ang\u00e9lica is 49 years old and a hard-working mother. She's married and she and her husband have seven children. They own their home.\r\n\r\nWhen Ang\u00e9lica was young she didn't care for farming, but later on she began to love it and she married a farmer. Her work soon turned to planting plantains, pineapples, and primarily coffee. When her children were very small, she and her husband redoubled their efforts. But now that they've grown, the children help Ang\u00e9lica and her husband with the work and subsequently reduce the number of days spent in the fields. The family organized coffee sales in various markets in search of a good price. This dynamic allows them to increase the earnings for their household, because while Ang\u00e9lica and her husband are selling, their children are working the land. With their earnings they can cover the cost of the children's education, including high school for the younger children and technical university tuition for the older children who live in other cities. \r\n\r\nGiven these achievements in the agriculture sector, Ang\u00e9lica learned to love it and care for her crops. This is her fifth loan with MFP, and during her last four loan cycles she worked very responsibly. Ang\u00e9lica attended group meetings respectfully and punctually, because she's a sensible woman who addresses the problems of her colleagues in the community bank.

In 1992, he lost his house and started a new life with a lot of difficulties in the city where he lives now.\r\nAnvar purchases his products at very low prices and is then able to resell them for a profit. Because he sells in bulk amounts, he deals with a high inventory turnover rate. Anvar rents a very good location at the market for his business and he has a small amount of competition. <p>\r\nHe has requested a loan of 2000 USD to increase his business capital.

She has been in business for more than 3 years, and currently sells mainly sports clothing and footwear for women, men and children.  She started her business selling cosmetics and colognes from catalogs, but she missed having her own working capital, and through loans from Mario Santo Domingo Foundation she was able to accumulate it.  She has always enjoyed being independent and contributing to the household expenses.  Her main clients are  around the Las Nieves area, the neighborhood where she lives, workers she meets going to the large businesses.  Her first domestic market, where she got her start, was her family, and since she is very friendly, she rapidly obtained additional clients.  Currently she is requesting a loan of $675 in order to fill orders already made by her clients for sports footwear and outfits for women, men and children.  Her biggest dream is to have a shop and her own home.

They have three children who are 16 to 30 years old, with two of their children having their own families and only one living at home to help Heide in her business activity. \r\n\r\nHeide joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 9 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Heide has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,000 PHP, which she added to her own capital, helped her earn a monthly profit of $1184, raising the family's standard of living. \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 10th cycle loan, she is borrowing 19,000 PHP again to supplement her own capital so that she can buy more fruits to sell. Heide is working hard so that she can sustain her family's daily needs and be able to save up for the education of her youngest child, and to set aside some money for the future security of her family. Heide D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team on Kiva.org to join our

The group is comprised of 18 women from the city of Ita.\r\n\r\nIt is a very active group, and all of the members demonstrate companionship and solidarity.  They attend the weekly meetings, and they carry out activities to raise money for the common good of the group.  The majority of the group members are continuing in the same businesses they have had since the first loan.  That way they are demonstrating solidarity and companionship.\r\n\r\nPablina is one of the members.  She sells bread and honey.  She does this two or three times a week, depending on the orders she gets from her customers.  She buys the honey that she sells in various areas of the country.  The bread is completely home-made.  She makes it herself in an oven that she has in her house.  Her customers are very satisfied with her products.  She is requesting the loan to buy flour, cheese, fat for bread, and other ingredients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":629673,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Cayo, at his tender age, is a young man with many responsibilities to fulfill. He was separated from his wife and so had to take charge of his three-year-old daughter. At first he did not know how to organize his time, in order to care for his daughter, but little by little he adapted. Today he works hard to give her everything within his capacity, and lives very happily alongside his daughter. \r\n\r\nCayo knows how to handle his money. At his age he already has two sources of income. With the support of the loans received he set up his own grocery store which is much frequented by his customers. At the same time he works in farming, growing cocoa plants. This work is done by day laborers, who handle the harvesting and weeding. \r\n\r\nWith the requested money he will buy bags of compost for fertilizing his land so that it may be productive. This will be his second loan with MFP. He is very happy to know that once again he will have your support so he may continue making progress. In addition he is grateful to his communal bank for the good efforts they made in the first group meeting. With the requested sum he will purchase bags of compost to fertilize his lands and make them highly productive. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":815170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to purchase bags of compost.

The second purpose is to buy a portable electrical generator which will be used in new residential developments that do not yet have electricity installed, so that he can use all his tools and equipment.

In the morning on market days and holidays she leaves very early to sell cleaning products, mostly products for the kitchen.  Most of her customers are women who are housewives.  She has been doing this for more than 10 years and thanks to the fact that the markets are crowded with people, she can sell a large amount of her products in just one day, making her job somewhat profitable.  The difficult part is leaving very early and walking for blocks and blocks offering her products in order to sell the maximum amount of her merchandise.  This is her first loan with MFP.  Susy would like to sell in her own place in the market.  She would like to invest in a larger amount of products and increase her earnings and savings in order to save enough for her own space.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":238108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase the amount of products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T21:50:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2009-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":67},{"due_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:03:55Z","rounded_local_amount":77.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228153},{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":77.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423385},{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:34:23Z","rounded_local_amount":77.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116647},{"amount":25.12,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:44:12Z","rounded_local_amount":77.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011578},{"amount":25.13,"local_amount":67,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:11Z","rounded_local_amount":77.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595207},{"amount":24.39,"local_amount":65,"processed_date":"2009-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:57Z","rounded_local_amount":75.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989397}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T22:04:49Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Crouch","image":59003}},{"id":83320,"name":"Houn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. H., 34, earns income growing rice crops and raising pigs for sale in Rumlich Village, Pursat Province.

Currently, in addition to the family businesses selling groceries and raising fish, her husband also earns wages working in a bronze casting business.  The family income averages about 4,000,000 VND (240 USD) per month.

She is married and has three school-age children. To make a living, Fagalele owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting bananas for sale. Fagalele has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Fagalele joined SPBD to gain access to financial services in order to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Fagalele has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. Fagalele is now requesting a new loan of 1100 WST, which will be used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. This will be the second loan she has taken out from SPBD. Fagalele plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and\/or expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout SPBD: <br>\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is 54; married; and the father of 3 children who are 18, 16, and 11.  All of them are in school.  He studied through 7th grade and didn't continue due to the lack of financial resources.  He lives in his own home with his family in the Matola neighborhood and doesn't support anyone besides them.  He left Chibuto for Matola in 1962 with his parents when they were transferred here.  He has had his own business for more than 15 years.  He works with his wife for close to 10 hours a day.  He makes a monthly income of about 13,000 meticais and applies it to his home's expenses and also saves some in his bank account.  He has never had a loan with another bank.  He became familiar with Hluvuku through his neighbor who is also a client of the institution.  This is his first loan in the amount of 11,500 meticais, and he will use it to buy products (oleo, rice, sugar, drinks, etc.) to strengthen his quantity of merchandise.

She supplies eggs to customers at their business place. Presently, she opens her shop every day of the week except on Sundays. Her biggest priority is feeding the children and making sure their school fees are paid.\r\n\r\nTaiwo is asking for a loan of NGN 80,000 to enable her to expand her egg business (sold in cardboard crates).
