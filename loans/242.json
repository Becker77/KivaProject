It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He was born on 31st December 1972 in Zanso, one of the villages in the prefecture of Kadiolo, the third administrative region of the Republic of Mali. He lives between Zanso and Loulouni town, where one of his wives lives. As he did not have the opportunity to go to school, he showed an early interest in income-generating activities, notably in commerce in which he has been engaged for seven years now. In view of the number of years he has been active in commerce, he is now very experienced and quite successful. \r\n\r\nThis is his first collaboration with the micro-finance company, Soro Yiriwaso. With his loan, he is planning to buy five parcels of various shop articles (milk, sugar, oil, tea, soaps, biscuits, sweets, coffee, Lipton tea, chicken eggs etc.) He gets his supplies in the neighboring villages and in Sikasso town and he retails his products in his kiosk in Loulouni for cash, and often on credit, to a customer base made up of men and women. He expects to make a monthly profit of 65,000 FCFA, of which a large part will be used to build up his business and the rest for family expenses. His ambition is to procure a plot of land in Sikasso town to live on.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":499398,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of various shop articles","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-03-03T19:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.57},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":21428.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.42},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:48Z","rounded_local_amount":22519.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021718},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:14:55Z","rounded_local_amount":22519.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746517},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:14Z","rounded_local_amount":22519.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779058},{"amount":46.42,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:57Z","rounded_local_amount":22519.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961261},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:41Z","rounded_local_amount":22519.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699392},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.57,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":22519.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913314},{"amount":46.43,"local_amount":21428.58,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:11Z","rounded_local_amount":22519.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180499}],"funded_date":"2010-03-06T22:28:50Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":186206,"name":"Shakira's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shakira is a wife of M.

She is an uneducated lady because she lives in a community where people don\u2019t like to send the girls to school for an education. They raise girls with the guidance of managing domestic chores. This same upbringing happened to Shahnaz and she learned the skills of managing domestic chores and cooking. Shahnaz has given birth to four boys. Her eldest son is a painter and paints doors and windows on call. The next to him works in a local factory on a monthly wage. The youngest sons are enrolled in school and are getting an education. Shahnaz's husband is a mason by profession. He has been in this profession for the last 20 years. Shahnaz is a very caring lady. She takes care of their health by cooking good food and presents it to her family on time, which makes them happy when they reach home. \r\n\r\nShahnaz is a regular client of Asasah (a microfinance institute in Pakistan and a partner of Kiva). She has successfully repaid her three loans to Asasah and now she is applying for a loan for the fourth time.

She is known for the treatment and good advice she gives her customers when they are choosing a garment.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her work is being able to see her customers happy with the clothes they take with them.  The most difficult thing is waiting until the weekend to have good sales.\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan she will be able to increase her articles of clothing to leave her customers happy.  This will be her sixth loan with MFP.  She is very happy to know that she will have the financial help, because in this way she feels secure about moving forward with her business.

Cara pemeliharaannya juga masih secara tradisional, karena belum ada dana tambahan untuk membuat kandang. Rencananya kalau induknya berhasil, Ayu Ardani akan membuat kandang yang permanen. 2 induknya sekarang sudah hamil dan yang satu sudah melahirkan 8 ekor anak babi. Ayu Ardani sangat telaten dalam mengurus induk dan anaknya. Umur 2 bulan anaknya dijual dengan harga 1 ekor babi Rp. 200.000.- jadi total semuanya Rp.1.600.000.- Harapan Ayu Ardani, 1 induknya lagi bisa melahirkan dengan

Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":237358,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more vitenge and rice in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-14T08:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tumpe M.

This will be his second loan which he is planning to use to buy a new species of potato called \u201csangi\u201d which research has proven can do very well in this area and have better yield. He hopes to use the profit from this loan to acquire more land for farming to meet the demand for his farm produce.\r\n\r\nFrancis\u2019s future hope and dream is to become a large-scale farmer and have his own farm machinery.

R. lives with her family in La Suiza de Turrialba, a quiet and tranquil region near Costa Rica\u2019s central valley. Priscila is 25 years old and is currently in her 3rd year at \u201cThe University for Distance Education\u201d (UNED) studying to become a preschool teacher.\r\n\r\nA goal of Priscila\u2019s is to be able to contribute to her family\u2019s income in a significant way, as does her brother. Priscila aspires to open her own business selling clothes in an effort to gain financial independence and to finance her university costs (books, tuition, transportation, etc.). Priscila has developed her sales experience by assisting a colleague with her business.\r\n\r\nThis will be Priscila\u2019s first loan with Fundacion Mujer. This loan will be used to make initial investments in clothing products to be sold in her community and at university. She will purchase clothes from a store in nearby Cartago (an hour from Turrialba) to sell in La Suiza. Priscila is confident in her estimation of potential earnings to be sought via sales to neighbors, friends and acquaintances.\r\n\r\nAs a full-time student, most of Priscila\u2019s day is spent in classes; however, she plans to dedicate at least three hours after class every day to her business. Priscila says that for business advice, she consults her mother or sister.\r\n\r\nPriscila has been studying part-time to become a preschool teacher since 2003. For financial reasons, she wasn\u2019t able to afford enrollment in a full-time schedule. Recently she has been granted a scholarship with UNED which she will use to enroll in full-time studies. Every fifteen days she must travel to Turrialba (thirty minutes by bus) to attend university - the rest of her classes she takes on the Internet. Part of her motivation to become a teacher stems from the fact that she has always liked caring for children.\r\n\r\nPriscila is a hardworking, determined and competent woman. With limited time, she skillfully balances her schedule: Tuesdays and Thursdays she spends working at a local day care; the rest of her time is divided between studying and babysitting her 8-year-old niece. Priscila also loves to play volleyball; she used to have more time to devote to her sport on a competitive team but recently it has become more of a hobby. She likes to spend weekends with her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":482105,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She is a mother of two daughters and two sons. Warda's husband has been a Palestinian NationA. Authority employee since 2005. Warda and her husband, Salama, decided to start a sheep farm, pictured above, since they have a big family. Warda came to FATEN and took a loan to purchase additionA. sheep and animA. feed. Warda and her husband raise animals for sale, which is increasingly rewarding and helps the family live a better life.\r\n\r\nWarda's husband appears in the picture because she is conservative, as are most of Gaza's citizens.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the culturA. context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principA. loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Some cope with it thanks to the support of close ones, some with the help of personal beliefs, and some by using their faith. \r\n\r\nSonya B., 54, is a leader of this group. She is one of those people who, in spite of harsh conditions, push forward and look for a bright spot in a seemingly dark future. Sonya and her husband, a construction worker, step by step built their own home and gave birth to four sons and a daughter. Unfortunately, the oldest boy was born with innate physical disabilities, and needs special care and treatment and constant attention. But Sonya was not discouraged by the illness of her son, and she started looking for ways of assisting her husband financially. She chose private entrepreneurship, because it\u2019s the most profitable option for her.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Sonya saved some money to purchase a couple of heads of cattle. She had to remember her skills from her youth. Year by year Sonya was blessed with success and achieved some good results in cattle breeding. In three years she managed to increase the size of the cattle stock dramatically. Now the business generates at least 5,000 soms monthly. Sonya applied for a loan in order to purchase additional cattle and keep her stock big and healthy. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has a 13-year-old daughter who is in the city of Lima studying.  Susy lives in her parents' home in Tapo-Tarma district.  She owns her own farmland where she grows crops with the help of staff who she hires.  She grows potatoes, peas, beans and carrots and sells her crops in the wholesale market in Tarma.  Susy learned this business from her parents, aunts and uncles, who she watched working the land since she was a young girl.  \"I grow a bit of everything.  Everything I grow makes me good money, especially the potatoes and peas\" she comments.  In this way, she is able to send a certain amount of money each month to her daughter and help support her parents in providing for the household.  In all the time she has been a farmer, Susy's main problem in continuing to work has been a lack of capital.  For this reason, she limited herself to growing a small quantity of vegetables.  She handled this situation with the support of family members and loans.  This mother hopes to save up enough money to travel to Lima and live there alongside her daughter, without neglecting her parents.\r\n\r\nThis will be Susy's eighth loan from MFP, to whom she feels grateful for the support they have given her.  For this reason, she pledges to make her repayments on time.  WIth her loan money, Susy will buy pea seeds for 800 soles and she will use the rest to obtain barnyard manure."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":919110,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy sacks of manure and pea seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-16T11:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1554.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097914}],"funded_date":"2011-11-16T14:56:21Z","paid_date":"2012-07-16T08:34:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":362457,"name":"Roberto Santiago","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Roberto Santiago tiene 45 a\u00f1os de edad vive en uni\u00f3n libre tiene 4 hijos, vive con la esposa y con los hijos de 9, 7, 4 y cuatro meses de edad en el Cant\u00f3n Ventanas Provincia de los r\u00edos.\n\nLa VRC ALAS DE CRISTO  se encuentra ubicada en las calles sucre y Ernesto Briones, pertenece al Cant\u00f3n Ventanas se dedican a labores Comerciales en General.\n\nRoberto se dedica a realizar conecciones el\u00e9ctricas hace 15 a\u00f1os, las compras de los materiales que necesita lo realiza en los almacenes el\u00e9ctricos y las instalaciones lo realiza donde le pidan. \n\nSolicita el cr\u00e9dito para comprar materiales para poder realizar las instalaciones.\n\nCon la ayuda del cr\u00e9dito obtendr\u00eda un beneficio econ\u00f3mico.

able to see her lifelong dream come true. Jessica has always had a passion for all types of art and has worked very hard to put herself in a position to transform this passion into a sustainable life. Located in an artsy district of New York City, her gallery is very diverse. It offers original pieces in paintings, drawings, limited edition photographs, and mixed media. The gallery is also very diverse in the services that it offers.

Her business is flourishing and necessitates increased working capital that she doesn't have. In fact, Mireille is hoping to buy more telephones so as to have telephone booths in other sections of the city of Cotonou. For this reason, Mireille is requesting her fourth loan from  ALID\u00e9 so as to satisfy her clientele. \r\n \r\nThe significance of ALID\u00e9 in the local language of Benin, Fon, is \"there is always a pathway for the poorest of the poor\".

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Such stores are convenient for people in the village who live far from the marketplace. \r\n\r\nMary Grace started her variety store through her initiative of dealing with customers. She wants to continue her business; it gives her family good proceeds to support the educational needs of her two children. She is requesting a loan of PHP20,000 so that she can have the funds needed to buy more food products and basic household necessities. This will allow her to attract more customers and increase her sales. \r\n\r\nMary Grace dreams of growing her variety store into a mini-grocery store and expanding it to other villages, to send her two children to college, and to have their own beautiful house and land for comfortable living. \r\n\r\nHer children are her inspiration to pursue her variety store. She now feels very happy for the help of ASHI and KIVA partnership, which allows her to pursue her dreams for her family. She hopes that they continue the service for a long time and help many families who want to get ahead.\r\n\r\nShe has shown herself to be hard-working to make her dreams come true and hopes that her business will continue to be more productive and improve her overall quality of life for her entire family.\r\n\r\nShe says \u201cThank You\u201d to all her Kiva lenders around the world for offering her financial support and giving people a big chance of reaching their dreams in life.

He is 32 and a native of a town where the principal economic activity is guava cultivation. He is married and has two children, who are in primary school. He has worked, from a very young age, as a baker, but four years ago he branched out on his own in order to provide economically for his household and earn a bit more income. He notes that it was his family who taught him how to make different kinds of breads such as the delicious chilindrinas (sugar coated buns), doughnuts, conchas (sweet buns), espejos (large, glazed cookies ), teleras (a type of bread), cuernitos (croissants) and many other varieties. \r\n\r\nJorge says that he gets up at a very early hour, at about 4 in the morning, to do his baking. He sells his bread in the city, since various stores have already placed orders. He is asking for a loan to buy basic ingredients such as flour, milk, eggs, sugar, cooking gas, food coloring, etc. He says that, especially in the month of November, he makes bread for the Day of the Dead, since the Day of the Dead holiday is celebrated in the country.

She goes out every day at 4am to seek out the best products to then head for the streets in the city to sell this food.  When she started out with her work she remembers that she did it with a small tray that only held 10 kilos.  Since then she\u2019s grown quite a bit and now sells trays full with about 120 kilos during the day.  She\u2019s been in business six years and has the satisfaction of selling a lot.\r\n\r\nShe does all her work alone though sometimes gets help from her children.  She started this business needing to earn better income for her family and thanks to much effort was able to consolidate herself into one of the most sought after fish sellers in the street because her customers wait for her daily to buy her fresh fish.  She hopes to continue to grow more and move her sales into her house.\r\n\r\nThis will be MFP loan #3.

Luz has four children: her eldest son is 27 and self-employed; her second son is 26 and also self-employed; her third son is 24 and studying in his fourth year of high school because he is going to night school as he works at night; her daughter is 17.  Her husband works as a field foreman.  Luz's goal is to continue in business as she needs the income for her family to put bread on the table.  She wants to sell merchandise in bulk to satisfy her clients' demands.  She dreams of a better future for her country, with more employment for Nicaraguans and a stronger Nicaraguan economy.\r\n\r\nLuz has run a grocery for 5 years.  She began with a different line of business, selling refreshments and breakfast to the coppersmiths of the Monte Rosa sugar refinery: she would distribute the food daily and her husband helped by collecting the payments from her clients.  She later decided to make money for her family by starting a grocery and she now has the two businesses.  Her goal is to keep both businesses generating income for the family to live on.  She needs this loan for working capital to buy staples such as grains, chicken, cream and cheese as she has to stock her grocery to offer her clients what they need.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":252919,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-11T04:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":7000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":636.36},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":636.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.09},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":675.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14858721},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:42:27Z","rounded_local_amount":675.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399970},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":675.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091968},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":675.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985352},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:33Z","rounded_local_amount":675.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445968},{"amount":34.09,"local_amount":636.36,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:41:07Z","rounded_local_amount":675.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956609},{"amount":170.46,"local_amount":3181.84,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3378.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174037}],"funded_date":"2009-01-11T16:06:15Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":87076,"name":"Shirley","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shirley J. is 50 years old, married, and lives in Obay, Polanco Zamboamga del Norte.

Now, from selling milk and trading in cattle, Anarkul makes $115 a month.\r\n\r\nAnarkul and her husband have many plans about increasing the total population of their livestock. Now, Anarkul hopes to get this loan as it would enable her to buy two calves to raise and sell. They need to earn extra money so that they can pay for their daughter\u2019s college education, as she is graduating from high school this academic year.\r\n\r\nAnarkul\u2019s partners are:\r\n\r\nVenera, 38, has three children. To support her family her husband works as a taxi-driver. Besides that, Venera keeps two calves and works as a logistics manager\u2019s assistant.

Her husband works as a training officer in a vocational school and Gulnara works as a doctor at the same school. After work she sells apples and keeps two calves. Gulnara needs this loan to purchase three sheep for breeding. \r\n\r\nAnarkul, 44, is divorced and has one son, 25, who works as a builder in a resort. Anarkul keeps a calf, which she is going to sell after raising it. As to her regular job, she is a cook at the vocational school.

On a monthly basis, Ingrid travels by bus to San Jose in order to purchase clothing. When she returns to her community she sells the clothes she has purchased and earns a profit.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the income Ingrid generates from sales, combined with her husband\u2019s salary (he works as a laborer on a banana plantation), does not provide enough money to finance family expenses; as a result, Ingrid also works as a house cleaner in order to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nTo say that Ingrid is a hard worker is an understatement: in the mornings she carries out her duties as a domestic worker; in the afternoons, she works selling her products in her community; and whatever time she has left over is dedicated to her own domestic responsibilities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Ingrid had a bad bike accident when a child\u2019s leg got stuck in her wheel; as a result, she had to take time of from her business in order to recover. Now she is healed and looks forward to dedicating herself to the success of her business.\r\n\r\nIngrid has successfully used previous loans to generate income from her business and used the revenues to make home improvements. This will be Ingrid\u2019s sixth loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer. The loan consultant that has been working with Ingrid over the years describes her as a responsible, hard-working woman.\r\n\r\nIngrid plans to use this loan to make general investments in the expansion of her clothing sales business. Specifically, this loan will be used to purchase inventory clothing items and perfumes to sell in her community. \r\n\r\nIngrid\u2019s goal is to use the revenues she earns to improve her standard of living and that of her family. Specifically, she would like to make more home improvements and enable her children to have access to higher education.\r\n\r\nIngrid\u2019s business is successful in the sense that she has a large client base. The problem she faces is a lack of working capital. Ingrid hopes that this loan will enable her to satisfy the needs of her clients by bringing them the products they request.\r\n\r\nIngrid values her business because it provides revenues which are used to finance family expenses and to contribute to her savings.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":509371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

At the same time, she will be able to generate more income that will allow her daughter to finish university and enable her son to build a home so that his family can live independently.     \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":576505,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase bags, backpacks, and clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-07-30T16:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Judith Erlinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":85292},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":91527},{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":93281},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":95069},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":96891},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":98748},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":100641},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":102570},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":104536},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":106539},{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":108581},{"due_date":"2011-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":116325}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.2},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.58},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.52},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.48},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.49},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.51},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.56},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.63},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.71},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.81},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":46.2,"local_amount":85292,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:06Z","rounded_local_amount":85511.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117144},{"amount":49.58,"local_amount":91527,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:00:56Z","rounded_local_amount":91762.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177411013},{"amount":50.52,"local_amount":93281,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:28Z","rounded_local_amount":93520.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550667},{"amount":51.5,"local_amount":95069,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":95313.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688273},{"amount":52.48,"local_amount":96891,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:07Z","rounded_local_amount":97140.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427502},{"amount":53.49,"local_amount":98748,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:16Z","rounded_local_amount":99001.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196000915},{"amount":54.51,"local_amount":100641,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:34Z","rounded_local_amount":100899.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201288924},{"amount":55.56,"local_amount":102570,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:03Z","rounded_local_amount":102833.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157077},{"amount":114.33,"local_amount":211075,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":211617.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230088},{"amount":121.83,"local_amount":224906,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:02Z","rounded_local_amount":225484.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673201}],"funded_date":"2010-07-30T19:29:35Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":223124,"name":"Sidi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sidi K. is 33 years old.

He has always been a very responsible father and worker. He has worked in the restaurant sector for a long time and his work has gotten the public's attention as he has always been attentive in learning how to prepare the different dishes that the restaurants offer. His goal has always been to have his own food business even though his family has discouraged him many times to not follow through with this project. He left his job and made his dream a reality by buying some equipment to start his business. He works in his home and every day brings him business. He has had much success with selling hamburgers, chicken wings, etc. What differentiates him from his competitors is the quality of his products and the good service he provides to his customers.

She has been doing poultry farming in Kitale town in Kenya and employs two farmhands, selling her eggs to the local market. \r\n\r\nHilder has requested a loan of 62,000 Kenyan shillings (KES) from Juhudi Kilimo to purchase and insure a dairy cow.

She lives in her parents' house. She has been in the communal bank for four years, and likes it because it helps her continue with her business and raise her child.\r\n\r\nTo support herself and her small child, she has a small business. Eight years ago, she put together all the resources she had, and fixed up a small shop  which she stocked as a small grocery store. \r\n\r\nFor her store, she bought all types of products, such as rice, sugar, cooking oils, detergents, etc. to sell to her customers. She works everyday from 6:30 am to 9:00pm, and sometimes later. She has had her shop for eight years and tells us that she has a lot of customers who make their daily purchases at her shop.\r\n\r\nShe is taking out another loan, and is going to use it to stock her store even more. She is going to buy stationery supplies, so that she can also sell these products. \r\n\r\nShe tells us that with the loans, her life has improved a lot. As she is separated, she has to see that her child lacks for nothing, and with her business, she is managing to do this. She earns enough to raise her child on her own, and doesn't have to neglect him, since her business is in her home, and she doesn't need to go out to earn money. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to keep moving forward with her business, and for her son to never lack for anything."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":868834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy stationery supplies to sell in her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Montecristi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2012-01-11T05:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yenny Maribel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":880,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":110},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":110}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:17:16Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257183324},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:29:20Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263318999},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:51Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033821},{"amount":225,"local_amount":220,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:35:52Z","rounded_local_amount":225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645900}],"funded_date":"2012-01-13T07:48:09Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:35:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff & Sandi Goldie","image":92452}},{"id":382974,"name":"Aline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aline aged 27.

M. is a married mother of three children, ages 8, 10, and 12, who is trying to improve her life for herself and her children through loans from Esperanza. She has been working with loans for about 1\u00bd years now in her business where she runs a small seafood restaurant. Her business specializes in seafood, but when asked what she enjoys eating most she says, \u201cMe gusta toda\u201d (I like everything). She is an avid churchgoer and a firm believer in Christ. In the future, Mrs. N. M. hopes to see her business grow and move forward to provide for herself and her young children.\r\n<p>Mrs. N. M. is a member of a 7 person group, Group 1, which is part of a larger micro-bank called La Revolucion, \"The Revolution\" in English. In the picture, Mrs. N. M. is in third from the right in the back with a blue shirt on along with members of her group and some others of La Revolucion. Her story is just one of a list of men and women who are improving their quality of life through the help of micro-credit loans of Esperanza. Together, this group has united with a common vision of a better life with faith and hope in their hearts and an unbreakable spirit. The concept of group lending is to have loans paid in a group to reduce the risk of a person defaulting, as others pick up where a person may lag to receive the next loan.

Ten members have end-of-term loans and the rest have monthly payment loans. They are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.

with his wife and their three children. Abass has owned a bakery for nine years. He does \u201csaj\u201dand \u201cmankoucheh\u201d. The \u201csaj\u201d is the metal oven where the saj bread is baked. A saj is a traditional Lebanese cooking dome used to make Markouk (\u201cthinned\u201d) bread and doughy confections or Mankoucheh. A mankoucheh looks like a folded pizza, the most common toppings being zaatar (thyme), jebneh (cheese) and lahm bi ajin (minced meat). You can eat it anytime of the day, but somehow it tastes better in the morning. Abass requested a loan of $2000 from Al Majmoua in order to purchase raw materials like oil, flour, thyme, cheese, coffee, and also a refrigerator. This is the first time that Abass has requested a loan. \r\nAbass is exceptional in his work because he does it well and his products are known for their good flavor.

for Business Development) is a cooperative of small-scale traders working in Thies, a city about 70km from Dakar.  The association was founded in 1993 by 20 entreprenurial women as a cooperative to increase their purchasing power and organize a tontine.  A tontine is a revolving group loan in which each member contributes a small amount to a daily fund, with a different member financed each day.  The tontine has evolved to more formal group loans through UIMCEC.  For such loans, the members are split into five-member groups, with a designated president and treasurer.  These sub-groups may be the same for many years, but often change members depending on financing needs and other considerations.  The AFDE organizes monthly member meetings and runs a cooperative for its members, allowing them to buy rice and other staples at a better price. The association's President is Ms. Mame Diarra Mar. \r\n \r\nMs. Penda N., 59, is the president of AFDE group No. 20.  Through the influence of her mother, she began selling in the markets almost 30 years ago.  She sells carrots, potatoes, onions and other vegetables.  She has eight children, all of them now adults.  Ms. Maimouna D. is the group's treasurer.  Her activity is traveling to the coastal town of Karay, some km away, to buy fish which in turn she sells in Thies.  Like Ms. N., she has been active in her trade for 30 years.  The other three members of the group are: Aminata D. who sells vegetables, Maty N. who has a small restaurant and Mame Fatou M. who sells fish.  Each recieves an amount of 100,000 FCFA to reinforce their activities.

D. M., 59, lives in San Miguel department with her husband, Carlos M. and their only son, who is 18 years old and a student.\r\n\r\nCristina has her own business, which is a grocery store.  She started her business wanting to improve her family\u2019s economy.  Her husband, with much effort, managed to launch the business.  It started off with few inventory items; it was all that their finances permitted.  Gradually, however, the business has grown but it still lacks many products.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, Cristina has called upon Integral hoping to get a loan that will allow her to increase her stock inventory, above all with such products that are in highest demand in her location.  She does all this with the great desire to be able to improve her quality of life and to live in a more relaxed way with respect to family finances because profits earned are of great help to meet household expenses.  This then allows Carlos to be able to invest more in the education of their children.\r\n\r\nCristina is a very responsible and hard-working woman who is completely dedicated to her store and to her household chores.  She always takes care of her customers in the best way possible because, it\u2019s thanks to them, that she can obtain her earnings.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan,

very hard-working.  He owns a bakery that he and his wife run; his nephews help him sell the bread throughout the city.\r\n\r\nHe is asking for his 11th loan, his 2nd with Kiva, to make improvements to his bakery. For example, repair the oven, columns and roof because with the rains they will get wet and become even more deteriorated and will prevent the bread from baking properly.\r\n\r\nHe states that the previous loan made it possible for him to consolidate his business because he was able to buy raw materials at a better price which led to higher profits.\r\n\r\nFrancisco\u2019s dream is to have a

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She resides with her husband and their children in a large traditional family in Sanoubougou I Kapel Kourou, an outlying district of Sikasso City (3rd administrative region of the Republic of Mali). After several unsuccessful businesses, this woman became introduced, over ten years ago, to the business of buying and selling clothing and finery, such as Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth), embroidered fabrics, handbags, necklaces, beads, etc. She buys her merchandise locally from wholesale merchants in Sikasso and then resells them from her spot at the neighborhood market where her goods are in high demand by her customers (composed essentially of housekeepers and condiment sellers at the market) for the quality of her items. \r\n\r\nConcerned about further satisfying her burgeoning customer base, Mahoua decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso. She is now on her first individual loan, which will be used to buy: 15 outfits of embroidered fabrics, 10 lengths of Wax <i>pagne<\/i> cloth, 10 handbags, and some women's necklaces. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mahoua envisions making a monthly profit of 150,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to increase her working capital, to help cover family expenses, and to pay the loan interest. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":843563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy clothing and finery","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahoua","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2012-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.29},{"due_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":35714.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.57},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.57}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":157.14,"local_amount":71428.58,"processed_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":72484.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232882133},{"amount":78.57,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:21Z","rounded_local_amount":36242.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699228},{"amount":78.58,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:41Z","rounded_local_amount":36242.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655495},{"amount":78.57,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:58Z","rounded_local_amount":36242.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874288},{"amount":78.57,"local_amount":35714.29,"processed_date":"2012-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":36242.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283115},{"amount":78.57,"local_amount":35714.26,"processed_date":"2012-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-09T08:27:02Z","rounded_local_amount":36242.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424618}],"funded_date":"2011-09-03T13:17:15Z","paid_date":"2012-05-09T08:27:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":329694,"name":"Dzame","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dzame is a widow with seven children, all of whom have graduated from school.

Only one of them is still in their care because the others have already formed their own families.  She lives in her own house in San Luis D. Shuaro District.  \r\n\r\nSince she was a little girl, Luc\u00eda has worked in the fields.  She learned to work hard thanks to the influence of the Japanese people and of people native to her zone.  Luc\u00eda is an orphan and even though her life began far from relatives she can now enjoy a large family because her nine children have given her 33 grandchildren.  \u201cI feel happy and rewarded with my family,\u201d she mentions.  \r\n\r\nShe owns farmland where she grows coffee, bananas and avocadoes that produce good profits.  In addition, this sweet grandmother has a business selling groceries, clothes, kitchenware, shoes, etc.  This business has grown since Luc\u00eda started it when she was 19 years old.  \u201cIf I\u2019m lucky, I earn 120 soles daily and every two weeks I buy merchandise for my store; I\u2019m doing well,\u201d she explains.

She hopes to see her children and grandchildren happy; she supports them economically in face of any situation.\r\n\r\nThis will be MFP loan #5 for her so she commits to being punctual with her payments like she\u2019s been previously.

He has had his business selling bicycle parts for two years. Operating out of Lupida, a small town in western Kenya, Peter sells all types of parts, including tires, rims, breaks, spokes, and peddles. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the biggest obstacle he faces is a lack of capital. There is high demand for bicycle parts in the area because bicycles are the central form of transportation in the region. It is the main way that people move from town to town, from the farm to home, etc, and bicycles are even used as an integral form of commercial transportation. Called \u2018Boda bodas\u2019, young men put pads onto the back of their bikes and take people for rides for about 10 Kenya Schillings (1 USD is about 67 Ksh).\r\n\r\nAs it is, Peter receives 10-20 customers per day, and is able to collect a daily profit of about 150-200 Ksh. He hopes to receive a Kiva loan so that he can increase his supply of bicycle parts, and believes that with a loan, he can increase his profits to 300-400 Ksh per day. \r\n\r\nPeter\u2019s business helps him to provide for his two young children. He is able to give them the basic necessities, but in the near future he will have to start paying for school fees. While primary education is provided by the government in Kenya, families still face minor costs for uniforms and books. Moreover, when his children reach secondary school, he will have to pay much more substantial costs in order to educate them.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
