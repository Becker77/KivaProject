With this new income, he will increase his profits.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":787487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Internet Cafe","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy stationery products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Puerto Colombia\/departamento del Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-06-11T00:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eder ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2011-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":125000},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":125000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:23Z","rounded_local_amount":126225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673814},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":126225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320371},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:24Z","rounded_local_amount":126225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803494},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:16:40Z","rounded_local_amount":126225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238614575},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-21T08:53:58Z","rounded_local_amount":126225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568535},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:06:28Z","rounded_local_amount":126225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779878},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":126225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188276},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:16Z","rounded_local_amount":126225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324505},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:41Z","rounded_local_amount":126225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038564},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:59Z","rounded_local_amount":126225,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650749},{"amount":141.67,"local_amount":250000,"processed_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T15:50:30Z","rounded_local_amount":252450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140363}],"funded_date":"2011-06-17T12:41:37Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T15:50:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":309603,"name":"Gemma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gemma is 37 years old and is a married woman with three children aged 5, 4 and 2.

Most youth who hail from Ntungamo are well-known sticklers for unwavering hard work.\r\n<p>\r\nThe referenced person above goes by the name of Benon, a 44-year-old father of six who, on the face of it, radiates nothing but warmth, humor and confidence. It's now 13 years in this enterprise.\r\n<p>\r\nBy and large, his business successes outweigh his shortcomings but making the best out of bad bargains is a philosophy he was taught and still reckons up to now.\r\n<p>\r\nHis auxiliary business is farming. Farming was literally his maiden business.\r\n<p>\r\nWeekly, this business's gross sales revenue is to the sum of Uganda shillings 100,000.\r\n<p>\r\nFor Benon, this is his second loan cycle. Some other members in his group are in their fourth cycle and some on their first cycle. The repayment record for the group has been up to the mark. Benon intends to use this Kiva loan to purchase more goats to resell.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1475,"image":{"id":855775,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":" to purchase more goats to resell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ntungamo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.916667 30.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2011-08-28T08:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Benon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Yonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luke","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Rosemary","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Annah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edvina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":4050000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":675000},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":675000},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":675000},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":675000},{"due_date":"2012-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":675000},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":675000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":245.84},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":245.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":245.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":245.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":245.83,"local_amount":675000,"processed_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:07:50Z","rounded_local_amount":682236.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232875425},{"amount":234.94,"local_amount":645085,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-21T09:09:37Z","rounded_local_amount":652000.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238868680},{"amount":238.05,"local_amount":653632,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":660639.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244648517},{"amount":251.24,"local_amount":689848,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:27:19Z","rounded_local_amount":697243.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":251313858},{"amount":202.29,"local_amount":555436,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-16T09:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":561390.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275464},{"amount":202.54,"local_amount":556132,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-28T08:04:44Z","rounded_local_amount":562094.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":264223589},{"amount":89.05,"local_amount":244501,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-10T08:13:10Z","rounded_local_amount":247122.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270319350},{"amount":11.06,"local_amount":28983,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-03T08:28:11Z","rounded_local_amount":29293.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276947440}],"funded_date":"2011-08-28T20:38:52Z","paid_date":"2012-07-03T08:28:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":334200,"name":"Gregori Pizza Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gregori Pizza est\u00e1 conformado por tres personas los cuales son: 1 hombre y 2 mujeres, grupo del cual Byron es el presidente.\n\nByron tiene 31 a\u00f1os es separado vive solo en tabacundo a una hora de otavalo; Byron se describe como una persona tranquila, emprendedor y sin miedo a los retos.\n\nTrabaja en su Pizzeria por un tiempo de 1 a\u00f1o y medio.

Her husband is Pablito, a farmer, and father to her four children.  She, together with her husband and children, manage their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.                             \r\n\r\nRegina operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5 of cooking oil or an egg.  She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a PHP 12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products to add to her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRegina hopes to be able to expand soon, just as she dreams to be able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":937493,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Alice is a very hardworking, energetic, young farmer. Although she has only farmed for the past 10 years, she is working hard and learning good farming practices. Through the profits she makes, she has been able to take care of her family and provide basic needs for her parents.  She is based in Chematany, a remote village in the Siongiroi area of Kenya, an area with fertile soil famous for dairy farming. The region's staple food is mursik, a mouthwatering delicacy prepared from milk. <br \/><br \/>Alice has been selling eggs and milk and this has earned her a decent income. She also engages in another business to make ends meet. Alice passionately loves dairy farming and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She wakes up every morning to milk her cows. While this humble mom has been making a profit by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. <br \/><br \/>Alice is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand. With this loan, she will buy a dairy cow that will produce between 10 and 20 liters of milk a day. This will help fully satisfy the demand.

Her dream is to be an independent person and to be competitive dairy farmer in the Siongiroi area of Kenya. Juliana is an ever-smiling young farmer who is responsible and has had to overcome many difficulties through her life. However, she has always found the strength to move forward and to keep growing in her life. She has defied the common thinking of most Kenyans about agriculture. She is the proud owner of a small parcel of land, on which she has been practicing mixed farming for the past ten years. Her primary sources of income are selling eggs and milk, and through this venture she has earned a decent income. She also engages in personal business in order to make ends meet. Juliana passionately loves dairy farming, and taking care of her cows gives her great joy. She is an early riser and wakes up every day in the morning to go and milk her cows. Although this humble mum has been making profits by selling milk to her neighbors and the local market, she is faced with the challenge of meeting the demand. She is known for having the best quality milk. Through word of mouth, customers have been flocking to her farm for milk. Juliana is seeking a loan to buy a quality dairy cow that will produce milk that is high in nutrients and will be able to satisfy the demand. With the loan capital, she will buy a dairy cow that will produce between 10 and 20 litres of milk a day. This will help to fully satisfy the demand. Through Juhudi Kilimo, which is a field partner, she attended training sessions and was taught the best financial management skills. This will help her save more money in order to repay the loan fully and to improve her living conditions.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2036463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy a quality breed of dairy cow","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Siongiroi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2580.45},{"due_date":"2016-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2655.9},{"due_date":"2016-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2733.52},{"due_date":"2016-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2813.41},{"due_date":"2016-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2895.63},{"due_date":"2016-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2980.26},{"due_date":"2016-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3067.35},{"due_date":"2016-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3157},{"due_date":"2016-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3249.26},{"due_date":"2016-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3344.22},{"due_date":"2016-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3441.96},{"due_date":"2016-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3542.55},{"due_date":"2017-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3646.08},{"due_date":"2017-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3752.63},{"due_date":"2017-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":3862.31},{"due_date":"2017-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3975.18},{"due_date":"2017-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4091.36},{"due_date":"2017-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4210.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.81},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.56},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.34},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.13},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.96},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.8},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.67},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.57},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.49},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.44},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.42},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.43},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.46},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.53},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.62},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.75},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":1472,"name":"Akossiwa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Madam Akossiwa A. was born in 1955 in Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9 in the Prefecture of Zio.

Nazokat is fifty-one years old. She is married, and uses all the money she makes to care for her four children and to provide for their education. Nazokat has three years of experience in preparing and selling walnuts. She always makes very creative use of her capital, adding inventory to her supply in a way that allows her to meet her customers' needs. She is also very polite and considerate, and her clients are always very happy with the service they receive from her. Because her business is doing so well, she is increasing her net worth month by month. Today Nazokat requests $800 for the term of twelve months. She is going to spend the loan on the purchase of walnuts with the purpose of processing them in order to increase her volume of sales. Nazokat expresses her gratitude to everyone for supporting her and promises to repay her loan in a timely manner.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

To help feed the family a little more, her husband drives a motor taxi. The family has seven children; one is married, and the others go to work and to school. Recently, Huth\u2019s fishing operation has been declining due to a lack of tools.

She will use the requested funds to buy larger amounts of school supplies for the new school term that is about to start because she will need to be well-supplied of this kind of merchandise.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":483372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy school supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-05T20:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alicia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2010-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":115}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.79},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.79,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:23Z","rounded_local_amount":119.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960329},{"amount":41.78,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:23Z","rounded_local_amount":119.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993176},{"amount":41.79,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:16Z","rounded_local_amount":119.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717961},{"amount":41.78,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":119.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751637},{"amount":41.79,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:21Z","rounded_local_amount":119.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934104},{"amount":41.07,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":117.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672879}],"funded_date":"2010-02-06T15:03:41Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":178196,"name":"Saitia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Saitia T. is 40 and married with 6 children (ages 4 - 20).  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Saitia has 3 years of experience in this business.  Saitia needs a loan of WST $2250 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Saitia joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Saitia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Saitia T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.4 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.4 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

When he grew up and had his first job he used his first salary to buy a camera.

Now, this is his main economic activity and how he supports his family.  He develops the film in a room in his house and works social events or by contract.\r\n\r\nHe will use the loan to buy rolls of film and batteries for his cameras so that he will earn higher income to

She is very upbeat that with this loan she will be in a position to improve on the mulching and gardening aspects of her farm, and also to increase her stock of animals on the farm which will help her increase the produce and sales revenue.\r\n\r\nMonica is the lady seated on the far left with her hand raised, and the others with hands raised are the secretary, treasurer and vice chairman for the group.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2050,"image":{"id":565908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"purchasing mulches and fertilizers for the plantation","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Ibanda","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.116667 30.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-07-18T17:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2050,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wilson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alex","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jackson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Merab","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":4600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":766666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":766666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":766666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":766666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":766666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":766666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":341.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":341.67,"local_amount":766666,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:46:57Z","rounded_local_amount":772166,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689457},{"amount":338.74,"local_amount":760099,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:48:05Z","rounded_local_amount":765551.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166903602},{"amount":156.94,"local_amount":352168,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T09:16:21Z","rounded_local_amount":354694.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172297075},{"amount":307.35,"local_amount":689667,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":694614.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177467350},{"amount":580.8,"local_amount":1303267,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1312616.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182605470},{"amount":322.27,"local_amount":723133,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:24:52Z","rounded_local_amount":728320.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188744649},{"amount":2.23,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:06:34Z","rounded_local_amount":4028.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191483428}],"funded_date":"2010-07-18T20:44:02Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T05:06:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":219464,"name":"Florymae","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florymae A. runs a <i>sari-sari<\/i> (variety retail shop) selling both food and daily use products in her community.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Tumarbong, Roxas, Palawan. She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  rice retailing and selling cashew nuts. Her husband, Arsenio Casing, who is 54 years old, earns his living as a driver, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are between four years and 12 years old. \r\n\r\nOlivia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education and to open a sari-sari (general) store. Olivia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Islomidin has been in the business of selling cows for over eight years. He buys them from villagers and throughout the nearby province to raise them for resale to abattoirs and farmers. His wife has been a fruit seller for two years. Islomidin is requesting a loan of $1,500 USD to purchase additional cows. This loan will allow Islomidin to expand his business and better provide for his family.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married with four children between 13 and 3 years old.

She believes that this will help visitors and foreigners that come to Caacupe on weekends to see her goods. <p>\r\n\r\nShe would use the loan to purchase seeds, fertilizer, flowerpots, and other items for her nursery. <p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Scott Crandall, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Francisca tiene 40 a\u00f1os, est\u00e1 casada y tiene 3 hijos, ella se dedica a la venta de plantas para jard\u00edn hace ya m\u00e1s de 12 a\u00f1os. <p>\r\n\r\nEl oficio lo hered\u00f3 de sus padres qui\u00e9nes fueron grandes comercializadores de plantas, actualmente, el negocio fundado por sus padres ahora esta a cargo de la se\u00f1ora Francisca, quien hace m\u00e1s de 10 a\u00f1os lo administra con mucha responsabilidad y esmero. <p>\r\n\r\nElla nos cuenta que existen muchos negocios del mismo tipo en su ciudad, ya que el buen clima y la tierra ayudan a la buena producci\u00f3n de plantas.

Sebasti\u00e1n R. is married and father to 5 children. He and his family live in and own their house in the city of \u00d1eemby.  Hugo sells leather-covered thermos bottles for mate or terer\u00e9, which are the most popular drinks in Paraguay.\r\n\r\nTerer\u00e9 is the most common drink in Paraguay \u2013 so common it\u2019s practically a symbol of the country.  Paraguayans drink terer\u00e9 in part because of the hot weather throughout most of the year.  It\u2019s made of very cold water mixed with refreshing or natural curatives, each with different purposes such as diuretics, weight reduction, treatment for high blood pressure, digestion, etc.\r\n\r\nMate is similar but is prepared with hot water.  Both terer\u00e9 and mate use thermos bottles for the water and \u201cguampas\u201d for the yerba mate (the dried leaves used to make terer\u00e9 or mate).  \u201cGuampas\u201d are generally made of wood, metal or cow horns.  Lately it\u2019s become fashionable to use leather-covered thermos bottles with unique designs, engravings and colors.\r\n\r\nHugo has a vehicle that he uses primarily for delivering his products and for purchasing materials.  He is applying for a loan to purchase thermos bottles, leather and \u201cguampas.\u201d\r\n\r\nTranslated from Spanish by Todd M.

Hugo se dedica a la venta de termos forrados en cuero para mate o terer\u00e9 que son las bebidas mas consumidas en nuestro pa\u00eds.\r\n\r\nEl terer\u00e9 es la bebida m\u00e1s t\u00edpica de nuestro pa\u00eds, es pr\u00e1cticamente un sello que nos caracteriza, el mismo es consumido ya que en nuestro pa\u00eds las altas temperaturas son muy comunes en la mayor parte del a\u00f1o, es por ello que se toma el \u201cterer\u00e9\u201d que consiste en agua bien fr\u00eda a la cual  se le adiciona remedios refrescantes o naturales que poseen distintos tipos de propiedades como diur\u00e9ticos, adelgazantes, para la presi\u00f3n sangu\u00ednea alta, para la buena digesti\u00f3n, entre otros.\r\n\r\nEl mate por otra parte es lo mismo pero se toma con agua caliente.

from an area where cattle-raising is popular, Suyunboy has been selling cattle since 2003. He buys them in his village from the farmers who raise them and then sells them at the markets. As his business capital is limited, he buys just a few and then after he sells those, he returns to buy more. \r\n\r\nToday Suyunboy would like to expand his business by increasing his capital, so that he can maximize his profits. For this reason, he is requesting a loan to purchase young cattle. This will be his first loan with IMON International, and his evaluation shows he is qualified to receive the loan.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Juana and her daughter live in a family member's home that they share with her nieces and nephews.  Juana's separation from her husband and her immense desire to get herself and her 16 year-old daughter ahead in life, drove her entrepreneurial spirit, with which she has succeeded in setting up businesses that support herself and which will almost certainly allow her to reach her dream of turning her daughter into a successful professional.\n\nJuana and her daughter currently share a family member's house with her nieces and nephews.  They live in a small part of the house where, for ten years now, Juana has worked making brooms, floor cloths and brushes.  She learned this trade from a friend who saw that she was having difficulties in making income.  Juana trained and learned how to make her products and also how to run her business and make her own opportunities.  With some savings she had, she was able to buy all the tools and supplies that she needed to carry out her business.\n\nJuana also started out in another business activity, selling soft drinks, sweet treats and other general snacks.  She now has the basic machinery, tools, chiller cabinet and shelving that she needs to carry out her income-generating business activities.  Through her businesses, she has managed to support her family.  A brother and a nephew help her to make her products and she has also created 10 jobs for other people in her community on whom she relies for her sales in the town of Barranquilla and in the towns of Atl\u00e1ntico and Bol\u00edvar departments.\n\nJuana tells us that her sellers' orders have increased recently and also, during the month of December, her other business selling drinks and snacks saw an upturn in sales.\n\nThis is Juana's first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will use this Kiva loan to buy materials for making her products: straw, cotton, wooden bars and cleaning brushes.  Juana's average monthly sales amount to $1,500,000 Colombian pesos, her profit margin is 50%, her autonomy is 98.9%, her liquidity is 5-1 and her sales are made in cash.

She is married and has 2 children aged 26 and 23.  \r\n\r\nIn 2000, she established her vegetable farming business.  Working 7 days a week and 4 hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid one loan from Patan BPW and used her most recent to seeds and fertilizers for vegetable farming.  \r\n\r\nIn the future, Shova plans to improve the economic condition of her family.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  For more information about Patan BPW, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/partners\/62\">our partner page<\/a> and keep an eye out for new loans and borrower updates.

manages a rolling store business, selling fish and chicken. She also buys and sells used clothes in her neighborhood. She usually roams around the village to sell fish, chicken and second-hand clothes. Her products are very salable in their village and for this she wanted to develop and expand her business in the market somehow. She believes that availing herself of a loan of PHP10,000.00 as additional capital will be of great help in her business and to her family.  Devorah patiently maintains it since it is a great source of her family income. \r\n<p>\r\nDevorah is 37 and married to Jaime, a retired policeman. They were blessed with three children: April Imee, who is 10 and in grade four; Princess Sarah, who is 6 years old and a preschool student this coming school year; and Jaimelyn, who is 18 months old. The family is currently residing in the large village of Research, Minante, Cauayan City. Devorah is a mother who wants the best for her children and she is fulfilling these dreams through patience and hard work.

cultivation and goat rearing business. To cultivate her crops, it costs Hilda $110, and to purchase a goat and piglet, it is $33 each.  Hilda believes her business will continue to do well because she has all the necessary requirements: the land for the crops and the grass for her goat to feed on.  \r\n\r\nHilda\u2019s business of farming and goat rearing helps her neighbors because she now provides manure and cassava.  In addition, by hiring the needed labor for her farm, she is helping strengthen her community. \r\n\r\nIn the past, Hilda has faced some adversity in her life: health issues, lack of capital for her business to grow, and the inability to pay for providing educational opportunities for her five children. In fact, because of past illness problems, Hilda lost her left arm.  However, with this loan from Kiva lenders, Hilda remains positive and can use the profit to further her children\u2019s education, to construct a bigger house and to purchase some much-needed housewares for her family.\r\n\r\nSince January of 2008, Hilda has been a GHAPE member, and says that she has benefited from the easy repayment plans as well as the various training the organization provides.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community among its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":299252,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To cultivate her crops and to purchase a goat and piglet","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Baingo, Belo, N.W.

They are always looking for a way to work through these issues and get ahead along with their families.

The milk produced by her cows is only for the family's use, and she sells her animals to the people in her community in order to be able to cover any unexpected expenses.\r\n\r\nGloria is a happy young woman and she enjoys a friendly relationship with all of the other members of her communal bank.

Her greatest dream is to be able to build her own house.  \r\n\r\nCarmen C. is 60 years old and was widowed 29 years ago when her husband was hit by a car. She also lost one child of the seven that she carried. Her three oldest children are married and the other three, who are single, live with her in the house she owns. They help her out in paying the household expenses. \r\n\r\nCarmen also works raising chickens, pigs and cows. She either sells the milk she gets from her cows to a delivery truck or uses it at home. She sells her animals in the neighboring community. She has told us that she's been doing this hard work for eleven years and that she learned it from her parents. Her work has helped to allow her children to get ahead in life. \r\n\r\nCarmen is in her second loan cycle and with this loan she will buy chickens and feed in order to continue with her work. Her goal is to build a warehouse in order to expand her chicken raising operation.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

Mandalupang, Manjuyod, Negros Oriental. She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  a general store and an Easy Ride Operator (transportation) business. Her husband Jimuel Y., who is 37 years old, works as a driver to earn his living. They have 2 children who are 5 and 8 years old. \r\n\r\nJennifer joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jennifer has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 5000 PHP, raising her family's standard of living. This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing  19,500 PHP, which she intends to use to pay for more stock for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nJennifer Y. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon--a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is also a hairdresser and her services are in great demand from the women of Koutiala.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase her working capital and meet the quality and quantity demands from her clientele, Awa came to the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. This is her third individual loan, after having properly repaid her previous two loans.\r\n\r\nShe wants to use this loan to buy 70 pairs of shoes and 25 handbags.

The business stability ensures a steady income and the family\u2019s possibility to improve their living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\nKhudoikul has been working with IMON for two years. For the entire period of time he has shown himself as a successful client, managing his loans with accuracy and precision. Today Khudoikul requests a loan in the amount of 7500 TJS in order to purchase the planks and paint for producing the cradles. Since Khudoikul has gained a reputation for responsibility with his financial obligations and for keeping his word, we are happy to have another opportunity to assist him with the operation of his business.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich place in history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the farthest reach of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged its already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve their agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have access to reasonable financial services. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Almost all his life he has worked in agricultural and ranching activites. 20 years ago he decided to settle in the city, leaving his place of birth in search of new opportunities. However, his wife passed away a short time ago and he is currently developing his agricultural activities more intensely. He rents land for cultivating and plants primarily maiz, alfalfa, and oats which after 6 months of care are ready to harvest and sell wholesale at his local market. In addition to this he sells animals, principally sheep, at the weekend livestock market. In this way he has managed to raise the capital which has allowed him to improve his quality of life and share it with his grandchildren. It is for this reason that he wants to buy his own land. This is his second loan with MFP and he is very happy to know that he has financial support and promises to be punctual with his payments. As well, he is grateful to be a part of his communal bank because all the members are very responsible and supportive people. He thanks those people who will be financers of the loan he is requesting as it will be very useful for the progress of his activity.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is a very simple man and a worker. He lives in his own home together with his wife Nelly, who is 26 years old, and their three dear children. He wants to provide them with a better quality of life. By driving his motorized rickshaw Darwin helps with the household expenses. He knows that he has a great responsibility within his home. He knows that he is the mainstay of the home and he wants to return all of the love that his family gives him. \r\n\r\nHe is very friendly to his customers and always greets them with a smile on his lips. What he likes best about his job is chatting with his passengers. He has worked in this field for 20 years and believes that the most difficult part of his job is having to be away from home all day looking for customers.  However, he knows that this is his job and he has to do it. He hopes that in the future he will have the necessary money to buy another motorized rickshaw and put it to work.\r\n\r\nThis will be his seventh loan with MFP. He hopes to be very punctual with his payments because he does not want to create problems with his community bank where he has participated actively and is a well-loved member. He will buy new tires for his motorized rickshaw with the 500 nuevos soles that he has requested because over time they have worn down. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":805351,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Rickshaw","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy new tires.

Many vehicles from other cities pass through Palmar de Varela on their way to other regions within Colombia.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":539296,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bicycle Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase bicycle & motorcycle parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Palmar de Varela (Atl\u00e1ntico)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-05-27T02:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tibisay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":66572},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":75598},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":77173},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":78780},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":80422},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":82097},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83807},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":85553},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":87336},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":89155},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":91013},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":102494}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.95},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.52},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.35},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.23},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.1},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.91},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.81},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.78},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.95,"local_amount":66572,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":69512.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636205},{"amount":39.69,"local_amount":75598,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":78937.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850300},{"amount":35.96,"local_amount":68492,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:34Z","rounded_local_amount":71517.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688187},{"amount":414.4,"local_amount":789338,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:53Z","rounded_local_amount":824205.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427424}],"funded_date":"2010-05-27T04:31:28Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":207222,"name":"Anualitte","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Annualite is a hard-working 24-year-old married mother of one child.

along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Madina is 42 years old, married to one husband, and has six children (24, 23, 19, 15, 12, and 9 years old).She is experienced for six years in selling clothes for children and dishes at Kigali-Nyarugenge with a profit of 200,000RWF each month. Now she is applying for her first loan from Vision Finance Company in Rwanda for 500,000 Rwandan Francs. With this loan, she hopes to expand her business by buying more clothes for children and dishes for selling in order to get more profits than before. At this time, she is selling as a retailer because of poor investment but she hopes that once she gets the loan, it will permit her to sell as a retailer and wholesaler at the same time. By doing both operations, obviously she will get more profits than before.

She is married with three children. She is an energetic, enthusiastic entrepreneur who operates her business simply but wisely. An example of this is when she has needed to purchase new clothing inventory. Rather than close her business and travel herself to buy inventory, she has paid other clothing vendors to buy for her so that she can stay and keep her business open. Mukhlisa is asking for a loan to help renew her clothing inventory. The change of seasons means a busy time of year for clothing vendors and this loan will help Mukhlisa purchase a good supply so she can maximize her profits and continue working to develop her business. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Mirzo was born in 1969 in the Kumsangir district, where he now works as a farmer. He is married and has six children. His main business is agriculture, which provides him with the means to meet the needs of his family. Mirzo owns a large piece of land where he cultivates different kinds of vegetables but due to the poor quality of the soil and the insects, he is no longer able to satisfy market demand. Very hard-working, he is asking for a loan of $2,800 to buy seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants. The money he is requesting will help guarantee a high-quality harvest for which Mirzo and his entire family are very thankful.  \r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Haitian emigrants. She is a divorced mom and makes her home here in a simple structure with a child. She says that her most difficult challenges are to work hard and return to Haiti, where her family lives. In the meantime, she plans to continue enjoying attending church and sharing with friends.\r\n\r\nLouise is excited to be taking her 6th loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and expanded her business. She has been operating her business for more than 5 years, starting with some savings. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business by buying flour, butter, oil, charcoal and other items. She will use the profits to save and plan her future, while she dreams to return to Haiti.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because of the opportunity to get loans, even as a foreigner.

Since the separation, they have become a very united family.  They live in her mother's house which is located in the town of Casacoto.  When she lived with her husband, Maribel had a small stall in Tarma central market.  There she sold vegetables to the local people who visited the market.  However, financial instability reached her household as a result of her separation and Maribel decided to start working in agriculture.  With the support of her mother, she set herself up in the village and started growing potatoes and corn.  Her produce is very good quality and, with every harvest that she obtains, she can see her efforts rewarded.  Maribel travels constantly to the capital city where she negotiates the sale of her produce for a good price.  \r\n\r\nAs the tireless hard worker that she is, Maribel also sells hamburgers on the corner outside her home on Saturday and Sunday evenings.  Every day she thanks God for the support that he gives her.  She would like to continue growing crops in order to gain more experience.
