She has two years of experience in this business.    Sosefina needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase baking equipment.  She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Sosefina joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Sosefina's second loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive, and self esteem.

They have an average age of 35 and on average, 3 children; they all live in the Bozo Kin neighborhood of Sansanding (fourth administrative region of Mali). <P>\r\n\r\nThey met because of bonds of marriage, of being neighbors, and at the market of Macina where they all go to buy their fish. <P>\r\n\r\n So as to grow their working capital and satisfy the ever-growing demand of their clientele, they decided to join Soro Yiriwaso with whom they are on their 3 group loan. <P>\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy 10 baskets of fresh tomatoes, 1.5 tons of fresh onions, 5 basins of green peppers and fresh hot peppers, 600 kg of smoked fish and dried sardines. They do their buying once a week at the fair of Sansanding as far as vegetables go. As for the fish: in Macina. The fish are re-sold in the fairs of Siribala, Dougabougou, and right there in Sansanding;  the other condiments are sold at home and in the market of  Sansanding for cash or credit and retail to a clientele essentially composed of women. <P>\r\n\r\nThey expect to make an average monthly profit of 33,000 F CFA which will be used to reimburse the loan and for family expenses. <P>\r\n\r\nNB : Bana T. is absent from the photo. She gave birth the day before the photo was taken, so there are 8 women instead of 9. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":277802,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchase of condiments and fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata\t   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maissatou          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mouroukerou\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ch\u00e9                                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baman   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bakota         ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bana        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Babagnini                    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maissan   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":295.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":591.66,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:32:42Z","rounded_local_amount":303404.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033672},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":151702.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621040},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:54Z","rounded_local_amount":151702.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020005},{"amount":295.83,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:21:41Z","rounded_local_amount":151702.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242750},{"amount":295.85,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:44:35Z","rounded_local_amount":151702.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678293}],"funded_date":"2009-04-05T17:08:42Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:44:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":95396,"name":"Dumba's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"N.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

determined to improve their lives. Her name is Mary Joy P.. She is 32 years old and married to Lino P., who helps her run their native delicacies business. They live in the village of Tabao Rizal, San Enrique, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nTo achieve her dreams, she and her husband make and sell native Ilonggo rice and coconut-based sweets like \u201cBayi-bayi\u201d and \u201c Kalamayhati\u201d in their community and other neighboring towns. Mary Joy helps her husband pack and deliver the finished products to their regular customers. They also deliver in large quantities to several retailers located at the pier on a consignment basis.\r\n\r\nA normal day in the P. household starts before dawn with the production of the Bayi-bayi and Kalamayhati, which are both made of rice flour, brown sugar and coconut milk. By 6:00 AM all of the sweets are individually wrapped and ready to be delivered.  After making the deliveries, they buy new ingredients and set up everything for the following day's routine.\r\n\r\nMary Joy is quite happy that many people find their sweets delicious and they now have many regular and loyal customers. She is able to supply all of the volume demanded of her product. But this was not the case in 2003 when she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her product was becoming more popular each day but she realized that her capital was just not enough to buy all of the ingredients to make their delicacies. After she became a PD member, she was able to expand her business with each succeeding loan, which also increased in value as she proved her good credit record. Now her rolling capital allows her to earn at least PHP 20,000 income per month, which is a big help towards gradually achieving her dreams for her family.\r\n\r\nShe previously borrowed PHP 27,000 as additional working capital for her food vending business. She paid her all her weekly installments and fully paid her accounts in her specified loan term. Now she is borrowing for her 10th cycle loan the PHP 19,500 to purchase additional ingredients and working capital. The income from it will be used to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying picture, Mary Joy is posing with a big batch of newly made \"bayi-bayi\" that has not yet been formed into tiny cakes and individually wrapped.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":406350,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She has 2 years of experience in this business. Naomi needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Naomi joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral. This is Naomi's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"\"overall social metric score.\"\"  For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"\"level of education\"\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

Her husband and older son work half the year in Moscow as construction workers.\r\n\r\nValentina likes to think of Balti as a fashionable city, and this reflects in the cloths which she sells.  Geared towards many ages with her eclectic range of clothing she tries to caters to the students who attend the local university to older professional working women into her stall.  She noticed when she started her business that there were too many other stalls just selling jeans and sweaters and she had to be different and diversify in order to succeed.  \r\n\r\nHer goal for the future is to one day move to a better location within the market.

Ortiz worked for many years as a bricklayer.  Unfortunately, this occupation did not provide him with a steady enough income given the work was intermittent and he was for many long periods without a job.  For this reason, he began seeking some type of enterprise where he could generate quicker earnings and move merchandise in short periods of time.  He began selling clothing and bedspreads by traveling to San Juan de los Lagos Jalisco, a city where clothing is manufactured at wholesale, to purchase his inventory at lower prices.  He then resells his goods in Victoria at a good profit. <p>\r\n\r\nSince winter has now arrived, Cipriano considers changing the type of clothing he is offering.  Therefore, he is asking for a $650USD loan, to be paid back over a period of six months, with which he can purchase more merchandise (such as winter clothing and bedspreads) that many people will be looking for now that cold weather is arriving.  With your help, Cipriano\u2019s family will be able to get ahead.<p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>   \r\n\r\nCipriano Ortiz trabaj\u00f3 durante muchos a\u00f1os como alba\u00f1il y desgraciadamente este negocio no le daba lo suficiente para vivir, constantemente se quedaba sin trabajo y las temporadas eran muy largas. Fue por es oque comenz\u00f3 a buscar un comercio en el que las ganancias se vieran reflejadas m\u00e1s  r\u00e1pidas y que el movimiento de mercanc\u00eda fuera en poco tiempo. Es por eso que comenz\u00f3 a vender ropa y colchas. Y lo que hace es ir a San Juan de los Lagos Jalisco, que es una ciudad en d\u00f3nde se fabrica ropa por mayoreo y por lo tanto los precios son m\u00e1s bajos que en Victoria y al revenderla le obtiene una buena ganancia. <p>\r\n\r\nSin embargo la temporada de invierno ya lleg\u00f3 y por lo tanto Cipriano considera que es momento de cambiar el tipo de ropa. Es por eso que est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito de US $650 para poder pagarlos en un plazo de 6 meses y con este dinero poder comprar m\u00e1s mercanc\u00eda como ropa de invierno y colchas que mucha gente est\u00e1 comprando puesto que los fr\u00edos ya est\u00e1n llegando.

Amadou W. is 41 years old and lives with his two children in his father\u2019s house with his extended family in the Massablacoura quarter in the city of Bougouni (Bougoni Prefecture in Mali). Coming from a Diawanbe family (an ethnic group which is very skilled in business in West Africa), he never went to school because his father was always moving. After a period of apprenticeship in the techniques of business, he decided to start a business selling hooved animals, notably cattle. Mr. W. has been doing this for 15 years and is an expert in this field. In order to obtain additional financial help, he visited the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso, where he just got his first individual loan. With this loan he plans to buy 15 head of cattle. He buys cattle in the villages surrounding Bougouni from cattle farmers, but he also goes to the main livestock markets in the region (Si\u00e9korol\u00e9, Ni\u00e9na, Koumantou, Massigui, Bougouni, etc.). His client base is comprised mostly of butchers from the market in Bougouni, but also families who are holding ceremonies (marriages, baptisms, funerals). He hopes to make a profit of 60,000 FCFA (about $142) per cycle which will be used to pay the interest on the loan, reinvested in his business, and used to take care of his family\u2019s expenses.  \r\n<b><p>Translated from French by Manuel Carreiro, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nMonsieur Amadou W. est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 41 ans et vit avec ses 2 enfants chez son p\u00e8re dans une grande famille \u00e9largie au quartier Massablacoura de la ville  de Bougouni.(Pr\u00e9fecture de Bougouni R\u00e9publique du Mali)\r\nUssie d\u2019une famille Diawanb\u00e9 (ethnie tr\u00e8s habile dans les n\u00e9goces en Afrique de l\u2019Ouest) il ne fr\u00e9quenta pas l\u2019\u00e9cole en raison des d\u00e9placements fr\u00e9quents de son p\u00e8re.

They are local entrepreneurs based in Waterloo, a small town 20 miles from Freetown city. They named their group Sababu. They are requesting a loan of LE 500,000 for each of them to help them expand their businesses. This loan will be the first these entrepreneurs are receiving from SMT, a partner of Shine on Sierra Leone. \r\n\r\nMohamed K. (left and also attached is a picture of his business) is the leader of Sababu group. Mohamed is 35 years old. He was born in Lunsar, in northern Sierra Leone. He is married to a businesswoman and they have two children together. One of their children is in Junior Secondary School II and the other is in Class V. Mohamed sells ready-to-wear-clothes.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Piniki has 3 years of experience in this business.  Piniki needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Piniki joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Piniki's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Piniki L. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.3 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is 44 years old and runs a convenience store which she was able to start several years ago with her own savings and money sent to her from El Salvador by her husband. Because of the difficult crisis in the country, he wasn't able to find work so emigrated to El Salvador and in this way was able to support their seven children. Only three of them are working; the others are in school and have many expenses.\r\n\r\nThey still haven't managed to complete their house which is made of concrete and zinc sheeting. The inside walls are still made of black plastic and earth--they haven't managed to find the money to improve them. \r\n\r\nWith this loan Julia will increase the stock in her store.

She lives in Sitio Ko-ol, Barangay Cabadiangan, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store and farming businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP3,000. \r\n\r\nVioleta is now borrowing PHP 22,000 so that she can use it as additional working capital. This will be her 13TH loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP20,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Violeta aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and to ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

With a loan she was able to buy more products to meet her customers\u2019 needs.  She is single and has two daughters.  They help her with the business so that she can go shopping at the market.  With this loan she thinks she will be able to have a bigger store.  \r\n\r\nMilagros de los Angeles is a single mother who lives with her two adolescent children.

She sells to customers who buy wholesale.  With three sons, she does not hire helpers.  She takes advantage of the familial helping hands.  Her sons go to school and help with the business.  Her husband works in a shoe shop and helps with household expenses.  With the loan she will buy flour, sugar and wood for the stove.\r\n\r\nElba Rosa S. is the coordinator of the group.  She has a store in her house.  She sells basic necessities, which she buys at the market.  She has two daughters.  One is in her last year at the University.  The other, 16, will be finishing high school.  It took great sacrifice to be able to educate her daughters because her husband abandoned her.  She was responsible for supplying them with all of the necessities.\r\n\r\n Their living conditions are humble.  They came to work with Adim through a promotion done in the region.  They liked the way Adim works.  They do not have collateral for a loan, but Adim had faith in them.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She is a native of the city of Cusco but has been living for more than a year in Pisac, located in the province of Calca. Pisac is an obligatory stop if one is on his way to the sacred valley of the Incas; this site has some beautiful Inca mausoleums and every day there is a traditional fair in the town center where handicrafts made by locals are sold.\r\n\r\nNatividad is 47 years old and alternates her household responsibilities with business; she is a single mother of three (25, 20 and 12 years old) and she works in the central market, next to the crafts fair in Pisac, selling fruits and vegetables. She shared with us that she wanted to sell handicrafts here to the tourists visiting the archeological complex of Pisac, but the craftsman union would not allow her to join them; she found no better way than selling fruits and vegetables next to the craftsmen. This was a good idea because the tourists and craftsmen were a big market for her; she realized she could sell these items to them since nobody else would; she noticed this was a new market and little by little it attracted more women with diverse products to the area; nowadays the area is growing and becoming more diverse.\r\n\r\nNatividad is requesting a loan to buy more fruits and vegetables in bulk and then sell them in the big fair of Pisac.

He is 34 years old. Claro is the group leader of an 11-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nClaro is single. He owns and operates a general store.  The main source of income for the business comes from selling food & daily use products in the local community. Claro has been engaged in his business for over 18 years and earns approximately 2,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) a month in these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Claro joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Claro is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & as working capital. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Claro from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisher-folk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Marina and her husband go to the fields very early each morning, to trim their cacao and citrus fruit plants.

She also has the help of her sister in food preparation and waiting on the public, and pays her daily for her help.\r\n\r\nShe likes her job because it allows her to have income to pay for the household expenses.  In the past she had an accident that made it impossible for her to work in a company.  When she recovered, seeing the need to have a trade she decided to get started in this business.  Now she sees that it is profitable for her, so she decided to continue making her business grow and in time open a restaurant in her house.\r\n\r\nThis will be her second loan with the MFP institution.

Their land is rich and gives them a good harvest. Their principal crops are maize (corn), hot peppers, vegetables, okra, tomatoes, and manioc. The problem for these people who dwell along the river is that when the river is in flood, they have no more work and spend all the money they earned during the last farming season on foodstuffs. When the waters recede, they have no money left to pay for laborers who are indispensible to them in sowing the land.  <P>\r\n\r\nThe custom of borrowing against the new harvest does not make them more secure and indeed leaves them worse off. They sell their future harvest at a laughable price to weathier persons so that they have the cash needed to do their farming. Weary of this practice, Donatien Pierre K.  has requested a loan of 130,000 F CFA which will allow him to farm about 1.5 hectares, growing the aforementioned crops.  \r\n\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":237859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"cultivating 1.5 hectares in corn (maize) and hot peppers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"Porto-Novo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.483333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2008-12-11T18:10:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Donatien Pierre","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":130000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":16250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14821557},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20357823},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:31:44Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27046873},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T10:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35938491},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44396157},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":32500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T17:08:35Z","rounded_local_amount":35475.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52904034},{"amount":34.39,"local_amount":16250,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-21T07:47:01Z","rounded_local_amount":17737.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126042}],"funded_date":"2008-12-11T23:47:59Z","paid_date":"2009-08-21T07:47:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":83156,"name":"Atsina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Atsina D. sells fish which she buys from the fishermen, bringing them home for processing and preservation, and then sending them to the market for sale, at Bantama near Elmina.

Judith was born on June 10, 1975 in Porto-Novo, the administrative and political capital of Benin.  She traces her roots to DANGBO, a village of OUEME county in southern Benin.  She has been divorced for eight years and has no children.  Judith rents a place in Kowegbo, an outlying district of the city of Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin.  She sells rich damask fabrics.  She is a seamstress by training, though she left this trade because it was no longer doing well for her.  She started selling fabrics eleven years ago and has a sizable number of customers.  She's thinking of diversifying her business.  She wants to sell more fabrics, some jewelry, and necklaces.

With five years of experience, he has a good command of this business, which he learned from one of his sisters. \r\n\r\nConcerned about satisfying his numerous customers, he decided to collaborate with Soro Yiriwaso.  He is on his first individual loan and intends to buy a sizable quantity of condiments of different types.  Supplies are gotten in Bougouni and in Bamako (capital of Mali) from wholesalers.  And sales are made retail at the same marketplace, cash or credit accepted, to mostly women customers. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Mr. Niar\u00e9 intends to realize a monthly profit of 26,500 francs CFA that will be used to expand his enterprise and to meet his family's needs.  He envisions opening a shop in the years to come. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

He is 42 years old, married, and the father of 4 children who are 5, 3, and 10 months (twins).  The oldest goes to school.  He attended 11th grade, but was not able to continue because he was drafted into obligatory military service.  He lives in his own house with his family, and doesn't support anyone else besides them.\n\nHe left Tete province for Boane to fulfill his obligatory military service in 1984.  After finishing his military career, he decided to continue to work in the Ministry of Defense as a driver.  Later, he married his wife and they secured a house in Bairro 07 in Boane district, where he lives now with his family.  He has been at this job for more than 24 years and earns a monthly salary of 3,300 MZN.  He uses this to pay for household expenses and he even saves some in his bank account.  \n\nHe has had loans with the Millennium Bim bank, but he later decided not to continue with them.  He found out about Hluvuku through friends who are also clients of the institution.  This is his 2nd loan, which has a value of 10,000 MZN.  He plans to use it to buy construction material (rebar, support beams, cement, sand, etc.) in order to finish with his work [building his house].  The previous loan was for 7,000 MZN, for the same purpose.  \n\nIn the future, he would like to request more loans to perfectly finish and furnish his house in order to offer better living conditions

However, she also keeps some products at home in case some of her customers need something she can sell them.  They buy these parts and products in Guayaquil and in Manta.

However, due to lack of resources, she is unable to move.  She is a single mother of three children all of whom emigrated to another country in hopes of earning money since unemployment in Nicaragua is extensive.  Thanks to the funds they send home she managed first to open a small grocery store and improve her home to leave a proper home for her children.  Now, she changed her type of business and opened a store where she sells clothing, shoes and toys; she used funds that her children sent her as well as financing to cover costs.  She has many years experience in sales but profits the last few months have been low due to the unemployment crisis and the draught.  With this loan she intends to buy clothing, shoes and lots of toys for the holiday season and hopes to recoup since sales should be better because many folk return home and try to make their children's wishes come true.  She also hopes that her own children will return soon so that she can be with them.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":417093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy clothing, shoes and toys.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-11-01T07:01:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lili Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.66},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.79,"local_amount":1375.86,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T10:56:36Z","rounded_local_amount":1421.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110601710},{"amount":64.54,"local_amount":1290.8,"processed_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T09:51:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1333.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118003155},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:14Z","rounded_local_amount":1377.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841314},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":1333.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1377.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874226},{"amount":167.86,"local_amount":3357.15,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:30:29Z","rounded_local_amount":3468.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604128},{"amount":70.73,"local_amount":1414.54,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:41Z","rounded_local_amount":1461.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821364},{"amount":94.74,"local_amount":1894.99,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1957.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561380}],"funded_date":"2009-11-19T12:54:14Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T09:03:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":152966,"name":"Nhem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nhem S., 39, is married with four children.

In the future, she wants to open a mini-market and hire employees so that she can dedicate her time to raising her family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":527630,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase rice, canned goods, and cookies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Fortin)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-04-22T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcia Gregoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":70.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":70.07},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":72.23},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":73.69},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":75.57},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":77.68},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79.47},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":81.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.07},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":72.23},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.57},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.68},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.47},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.25,"local_amount":70.25,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:25Z","rounded_local_amount":70.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708357},{"amount":70.07,"local_amount":70.07,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:15Z","rounded_local_amount":70.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151891551},{"amount":72.23,"local_amount":72.23,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":72.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631802},{"amount":73.69,"local_amount":73.69,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:36Z","rounded_local_amount":73.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845687},{"amount":75.76,"local_amount":75.76,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:03Z","rounded_local_amount":75.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172111965},{"amount":77.49,"local_amount":77.49,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":77.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405370},{"amount":79.47,"local_amount":79.47,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:04:54Z","rounded_local_amount":79.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182543850},{"amount":81.04,"local_amount":81.04,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:09:14Z","rounded_local_amount":81.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188680611}],"funded_date":"2010-04-24T21:35:14Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:09:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":198738,"name":"Thu's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"T.

She sold these to people hosting birthday parties.  With her first attempts, she increased her investment several times over and, with the savings from her business and her husband's savings, she started selling food products and other products with which Colombian families fill their daily shopping baskets.  Today her business is a large store.\r\n\r\nRoci\u00f3 M. lives in the town of Soledad, 15 minutes from Barranquilla, with her husband and three children aged 1, 2 and 6.

Her business has a working capital of 2,463,730 colombianos, her accounts receivable period is 2 days and her inventory turnover period is 14 days.\r\n\r\nThis is Roci\u00f3 M.'s first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she plans to invest it in buying a sack of rice, a sack of sugar, two 5 gallon cans of oil, one large and one small box of sardines, toilet paper, disposable diapers, soda, toothpaste and general sweet treats.
