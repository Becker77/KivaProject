Anita has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Anita joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Anita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Anita from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

The members sell perfume, earrings, necklaces, pots, napkins, pastries and toys.  During their time with Emprender they have participated in 6 loan cycles; the founding members of the bank have remained, and they have expanded their membership by 10 percent.\r\n\r\nSenora Rosse Es is the leader, president, and one of the founding members of the bank.  This is her 6th loan cycle, and she is taking on the position of bank president.  She has been a merchant since she was very young; she sells jewelry and other miscellaneous items, including cosmetics.  She has 3 daughters; the middle daughter helps her with the sales.  Her husband does not generate much income, and for this reason she must continue to work to support her family so that she can help her husband so that the family lacks for nothing in the home, and so that she can proviD. support for the education of her children so that in the future they can have a profession and a better economic situation.  Her participation in the group came about thanks to her companions who invited her to join the group.\r\n\r\nThe loans they obtained were invested in their capital and were also used to allow the members to travel to sell in markets in other regions of the country such as Santa Cruz and Cochabamba.\r\n\r\nPatricia is one of the organizers and founders of a group that evolved into the communal bank Nueva Luz; she has worked with Emprender for 3 years.  She is the treasurer of the bank, and is one of the most dynamic members of the group; she has been very demanding of the other members during the time she has been with the group.  \r\n\r\nPatricia sells a variety of products (jewelry and other consumer goods) with her cart.  She travels with her products to markets and fairs to sell her goods.  She works with her husband in this business.  She has 3 daughters; her oldest daughter is 12, and the younger ones are 8 and 3 years old.  The loan she obtained helped her substantially in being able to improve the economic status of her family, and to proviD. a better life for her children, as she was able to generate an increased income by increasing her working capital. \r\n\r\nPatricia will use this loan to invest in the purchase of a store or sales post in one of the markets.  Her wish is to be able to have her own home and a store.  She hopes that these dreams will become reality in the future.  \r\n\r\nCristina Es, one of the founders of the bank, currently sells cosmetics, socks, rings, wallets and other items from a cart.  Cristina is an enterprising woman who supports her 2 daughters on her own.  She came to know the financial institution Emprender thanks to her companions, who invited her to become part of the group.  In this way she was able to access a loan, which helped her to increase her merchandise.  This was a great help to her, as thanks to the loan, she was able to pay for the education of her daughter who is in school.  In addition, Cristina makes quilts and bed sheets by hand in her free time.  \r\n\r\nAll of the members are grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the confidence they have provided in granting this loan.

Matilde is responsible for supporting the children and paying the family's other expenses because her husband abandoned the family several years ago.  She is an amazing mother who has managed to raise her children while working hard to support them.  Matilde operates a business selling fresh vegetables and grains, along with other produce.  She buys the products herself from a farm in the country and brings them to her town for sale.  She is applying for a loan so that she can buy potatoes, cheese, beans and meat that she will resell.

This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nNehemia is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Nehemia from ASKI.

It has 38 branches covering the central and northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk, and small business entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Cienaga Grande Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"The women of this communal bank come from the community of Cienega Grande.  This community is located in a rural area within the Department of Solol\u00e1.  The most common crops grown in the community are corn and potatoes.  The residents are indigenous and the vast majority of them wear traditional clothing.  The women can be seen walking around the town wearing short or long skirts and huipiles\u2014traditional blouses made of handmade fabric\u2014or embroidered blouses.  Many of the men wear Western clothing, though some of them still wear traditional clothing.<p>\r\n\r\nMost of the members of the bank sell traditional clothing for a living.  Selling traditional clothing in the rural areas is a lucrative business because there is much demand for it, especially among women.<p>\r\n\r\nSome of the women in the group are going to invest their loans in other types of businesses, including a shoe store, a furniture store, a tortilla shop, and a shop that sells poultry.  The Brisas de Cienega Grande group includes a variety of non-traditional businesses.  This can be a factor that helps the women\u2019s business development in the communal bank, since all of them share their experiences with their various businesses.<p>\r\n\r\nMost of the women said that things were going well with their respective businesses.  When asked about competition, they said that it was present, but that it did not prevent their businesses from being successful.  The women who sell traditional clothing mentioned that all of their products are sold within the community.<p>\r\n\r\nThe members of the Brisas Cienega Grande group say that they enjoy working in a communal bank, mainly because they would not have been able to obtain a loan otherwise.  They also enjoy working together because they know each other well and know that they all have excellent credit records.<p>\r\n\r\nAnother factor that makes this group unique is that all of the women are able to support their children\u2019s education, and all of them send their children to school.  While it might seem like this should be the rule, this is unfortunately not the case in Guatemala, where the illiteracy rate is very high.  These women are thus helping their country to develop not just economically, but also socially.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Chris Knutson, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nLas mujeres de este banco comunal provienen de la comunidad Cienega Grande. Esta comunidad est\u00e1 ubicada en un \u00e1rea rural dentro del departamento de Solol\u00e1. En esta comunidad la siembra de ma\u00edz y papa es lo m\u00e1s com\u00fan . Los habitantes de esta comunidad son ind\u00edgenas y la gran mayor\u00eda utilizan trajes tradicionales. Las mujeres caminan con cortes, faldas largas, y huipiles, blusas tejidas a mano, o blusas bordadas alrededor del pueblo. Muchos hombres utilizan ropa occidental, sin embargo se encuentran un grupo que todav\u00eda preservan su vestimenta tradicional. \r\n\r\n<P>La mayor\u00eda de clientas trabajan con ropa t\u00edpica. La venta de ropa t\u00edpica en las \u00e1reas rurales es un buen negocio porque hay mucha demanda por ella, especialmente el sector femenino de la poblaci\u00f3n. \r\n\r\n<P>En el grupo tambi\u00e9n se puede encontrar mujeres que van a invertir su cr\u00e9dito en una zapater\u00eda, muebler\u00eda, tortiller\u00eda y venta de pollos. En Brisas de Cienaga Grande se puede encontrar una variedad de negocios at\u00edpica. Esto puede ser un factor que ayude al desarrollo de las empresarias dentro del banco comunal porque todas intercambian experiencias de sus distintos negocios. \r\n\r\n<P>La mayor\u00eda de se\u00f1oras comentaban que les iba bien con sus respectivos negocios. Cuando se les pregunt\u00f3 sobre la competencia, ellas dijeron que si estaba presente pero no era un gran inconveniente para el \u00e9xito de sus negocios. Las se\u00f1oras que venden ropa t\u00edpica comentaron que todos sus productos se venden dentro de su comunidad. \r\n\r\n<P>Las Brisas Cienega Grande dicen que les gusta trabajar en un banco comunal, principalmente porque de otra manera ellas no hubieran podido sacar un pr\u00e9stamo. Tambi\u00e9n les gusta trabajar en conjunto porque todas se conocen bien y saben que todas tienen un record crediticio excelente. \r\n\r\n<P>Otro factor que hace a este grupo \u00fanico es que todas las se\u00f1oras realmente apoyan a la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos. Todas mandan a sus hijos al colegio. Aunque al parecer esta deber\u00eda de ser la regla, no es la realidad de Guatemala. Los \u00edndices de analfabetismo son alt\u00edsimos. Es por eso que estas mujeres no solo ayudan al desarrollo econ\u00f3mico del pa\u00eds, sino al social tambi\u00e9n."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3600,"image":{"id":166073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

They now have savings of GS.1,500,000 on deposit at a local Cooperative.  Moreover, they sponsor activities such as raffles and food sales to support a Caja D.

Now, he is fighting to recover and it is difficult to return to work.  Still, he is thinking about the future and hopes to save enough money for retirement and to better provide for his household.  \r\n\r\nDona Maria has been running a business selling second-hand clothing and cosmetics out of their home for 8 years, and also traveling to visit customers.  She first started the business to help generate more income for the family.  She specifically decided to sell second-hand clothing since she did not know what type of work she could do after she was previously a pork butcher.  They previously owned a small store, but they could not continue running the store while his illness required him to stay in bed.  Since she knew they still had to provide for the children, she began searching for other work.  She decided to sell second-hand clothing such as shirts and pants.  Since men started coming to the house to purchase pants, she decided to expand the business by traveling and selling on certain streets to earn more money.  The money she is requesting in the loan will be used to make necessary investments to buy additional merchandise for her business to meet the demand of the customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Josh Wilcox, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":267357,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-10T18:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria De La Concepcion ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":833.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.12,"local_amount":842.3,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:30Z","rounded_local_amount":842.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092061},{"amount":41.21,"local_amount":824.36,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":824.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985443},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:29Z","rounded_local_amount":833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446059},{"amount":41.92,"local_amount":838.39,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":838.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956696},{"amount":41.43,"local_amount":828.27,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-05T09:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":828.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66055587},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599722},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:49:12Z","rounded_local_amount":833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035612},{"amount":125.01,"local_amount":2499.99,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:33:31Z","rounded_local_amount":2499.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789988},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:32:32Z","rounded_local_amount":833.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680679},{"amount":41.63,"local_amount":833.37,"processed_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:46Z","rounded_local_amount":833.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075230}],"funded_date":"2009-02-11T10:48:23Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Josh Wilcox","image":392254}},{"id":91785,"name":"Fatou Bintou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Fatou Bintou S., 34 ans est mari\u00e9e avec 03 enfants  en charge.

But most of all they are the best weavers in the Cusco valley. They have a very distinct technique and make scarfs, blankets, lace, ponchos, caps and beautiful works depicting nature. All of this is done by hand and with natural dyes. All of what they know they learned from their ancestors, and this knowledge is passed on from generation to generation. It also allows them to participate in the tourism industry, and they are very friendly people who want to share and keep their traditions alive. <p>\r\nWith the loan, the members will purchase seeds for their new crops, some heads of cattle for livestock, and alpaca and sheep fleece so their wives can continue weaving.

is a resident of San Vicente, Quirino, Isabela. She is already 55 years old and married to Nelson, a farmer.  They are blessed with three children: Janet, a 30-year-old computer-science graduate who is now working as a domestic helper abroad; Jonel, a 27-year-old driver\/mechanic graduate; and Joenard, a 23-year-old security guard. Lilia was glad and proud of her children because they learned to combat poverty by looking for a job. She just hopes that they will someday become successful with their chosen careers.  \r\n<p>\r\nLilia used to manage a sari-sari store (community-based store) in their village.  But for some reason it went bankrupt and closed for a time.  She is now asking for financial assistance from the lenders so she can be able to reopen her store. Her request of PHP 10,000.00 will be used to buy different groceries that she can display and offer to her customers. She is working hard to uplift their living conditions. According to her, she must be very patient in order to achieve her goals in life. \r\n<p>\r\nShe is thankful that her children also help them with their needs. Despite this, she still wants to have her own business and not depend too much on her children since they also have their own families.  She was very excited to have her store back that used to be her partner in sending her children to school.

She earns her living by buying and selling ready-to-wear clothes and accessories. Her husband Adelino A., who is 26 years old, works as a family driver to earn his living. They have an 8-year-old child. Maicel joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Maicel has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 13,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 5,000 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth cycle loan, she is borrowing 17,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase more stocks to sell, so that she can continue saving up for the future education of her child. Maicel is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

As soon as she attains enough funding, Ashley plans on resigning from her current job and completely dedicating herself to starting the Capital Area Phoenix Initiative. \r\n\r\nAshley decided to start this non-profit because on a daily basis, she witnesses how challenging it is to navigate the medical system, especially with an isolating condition like HIV\/AIDS. This non-profit will help clients apply for Medicaid, insurance, food stamps, and find counseling and support. Furthermore, Ashley is dedicated to educating the public about the prevention of HIV\/AIDS as well, which differentiates her agency from others. Once Ashley finishes her certification for Medicaid at the end of November, she will be able to start taking referrals and working with clients. \r\n\r\nAshley plans on hiring six employees in the beginning to help her accomplish the tri-fold vision of her business: outreach and prevention, case management, and ultimately, a free clinic. Her goal is to open her doors on World AIDS day on Dec. 5th to offer free AIDS testing. Aside from applying for non-profit status, Ashley\u2019s biggest challenge was finding a space for an office that would be located within a larger building so that clients could enter the building without fear of being noticed. Ashley is very proud that she found the perfect location after looking for quite a while. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Ashley plans on buying office equipment and signs. Ashley\u2019s motivation is unstoppable because \u201cI want to be a better person and be more humble about helping others. That\u2019s my goal in life. This infection could happen to anybody at any time. It doesn\u2019t differentiate between race, age, or gender. My goal is to prevent more people from getting this.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4775,"image":{"id":632178,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"Office

Her family economy at that time was very poor because of lack of money and her husband was not in good health conditions. With the borrowed money from the Fund, she started breeding pigs. At first, she had one pig, and the number of pigs increased gradually. Her profit from breeding pigs was used to help her son build a house, and furnish her own home. Currently, she is breeding 30 pigs, each of 45kg and they are all ready to be sold. This time, she wants to borrow 1200 USD to expand her farm and buy more pigs. Her average income is 300USD\/ month. \r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb M\u1ea1c, 60 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 1995.

Three years ago, she decided to open her business, and due to her ability to cook, she chose to open a restaurant, which she started in her home.  Now it is located on one of the main streets of her town, which guarantees her sales.  Elizabeth offers lunch and dinner.  Her work begins every morning very early when she buys fresh ingredients for the meals that she needs to prepare.  At midday when she has many more clients, she needs her children and her mother to attend to the customers.  At night she has to clean.

A. lives in Santa Tecla, in the department of La Libertad. No one ever taught her how to cook, how to manage, and much less how to run a business. Her dreams were precisely to have her own business with her mother. With perseverance and faith in herself and the support of her family, she has had a small store for five years in her own house, where she started selling tortillas. Now she sells all kinds of products that are used on a daily basis. Curiously, her only daughter, Erica, is also 5 years old, which clarifies the great turn that Ana Cecilia took in her life in only half a decade. Ana is requesting a loan, since she considers this to be the right time to bet a little more on her family and buy new merchandise to grow her store. As life has taught her, desire, accompanied with effort and patience, leads to results. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva

El mes de octubre es una temporada donde hay gran demanda de flores y el precio sube, por ello trabaja junto a su esposa para la recolecci\u00f3n y preparaci\u00f3n de los ramos que transporta al mercado de flores de su ciudad, esta es una labor de mucho cuidado para no maltratar los p\u00e9talos. Mateo tiene la esperanza de que durante la \u00faltima semana de octubre podr\u00e1 obtener muy buenas ganancias, debido a la tradici\u00f3n en estos d\u00edas de visitar los cementerios. Y con estas ganancias podr\u00e1 solventar la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos.\n\nDurante sus tres cr\u00e9ditos anteriores con MFP, no tuvo dificultades de pago. Asimismo, su cargo como tesorero de su banco comunal lo viene cumpliendo responsablemente. Con el dinero que ahora solicita comprar\u00e1 semillas de arvejas e invertir\u00e1 en el preparado de la tierra para su pr\u00f3xima siembra.","en":"Mateo is a man with a great sense of humor; he is 40 years old and is the father of 5 children.  He has been involved in agriculture since childhood.  Currently, he is sowing potatoes and peas on a rented plot where he pays 1200 soles per hectare per year; at times he works just to pay the rent.  Therefore, Matthew works very hard to make the most of the land and has set out to plant gladioli, which has proved very profitable.  The month of October is a time when there is a great demand for flowers and the price rises, so he works with his wife to collect and prepare the bouquets that he then transports to the flower market in his city.  He must work very carefully so as to avoid damaging the petals.  Mateo is hoping that during the last week of October he will be able to have very good earnings, owing to the tradition in this area of visiting cemeteries during this time of year.  With these earnings he will be able to afford to educate his children. \r\n\r\nDuring his 3 previous loans from MFP he had no difficulties making the payments.  Also, he has carried out his position of treasurer with his communal bank very responsibly.  With the money that he is currently requesting he will buy pea seeds and will invest in preparing the earth for the next harvest.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

Their warmth and friendliness allow visitors to feel at home.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Aurelia F. is an active member of the Santa Ana Communal Bank.  She is 60 years old and lives in Santa Ana Parish with her husband.  Their three children are adults with their own families.  They all live under the same roof but assume different responsibilities and make sacrifices for the other family members.  Her husband works as a cattle dealer.  \r\n<p>\r\nAurelia prepares and sells food.  She butchers her own pigs for making savory dishes such as roasted pork, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sancocho\" target=\"_blank\" >sancocho<\/a>, blood sausage, etc.  Aurelia has been in this business for 20 years and says that there are both good days and bad, but she always manages to earn a little bit of profit.

Rosario has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately $100 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosario joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Rosario has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding her business. \r\n\r\nRosario is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP which again will be used to invest in her business. This will be her 2nd loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

These days, her working capital went from 200,000 francs to 800,000 francs [$500 to $2,000 USD];  her booth, which was constructed of fragile materials in the beginning, has become an actual bar--restaurant, where customers benefit from the comfort.  Ms. A. helps her husband a lot at home.  With her profits, she has created two other sales outlets and has acquired a parcel of land.  She was born around 1975 in Bonou in the wealthy county of Oueme.  Married, she is the mother of three children, one of whom is in school.

She lives in the village of Prk Paraiso, Brgy Taloc, Bago City, Negros Occidental. She is 56 years old and married. Her husband, Rafael D., manages their 1.25-hectare rice farm. He also helps Leonora run their other business ventures. Together, Rafael and Leonora have 5 children, 3 of whom are already married. The other 2 are still single and live at home. Leonora has 5 grandchildren. \r\n\r\nLeonora buys and sells rice because rice production is prevalent in their community. Her trading business was earning her a good income, but when the opportunity to join NWTF-Project Dungganon came, she did not hesitate, and expanded her business activities to include pig fattening in 2001. Leonora treated this new business as a way to secure additional income. Every time she sold a hog, she would save a portion of the proceeds in her emergency fund. She also used the income to pay for her children's tuition. With the added income from hog-raising she was able to earn an average monthly income of 30,000 Philippine pesos, or about $630 US, good income that provides a comfortable living for her family.\r\n\r\nBecause Leonora is a responsible businesswoman, repays loans well, is very responsible and has good leadership qualities, she was elected as a center chief by other members of NWTF-PD. She wants to prove and teach other members that being a hardworking person helps improve one's standing in life. Even with the added responsibilities, Leonora continues to do well in her business activities and is a good center chief.\r\n\r\nFor her previous loan she borrowed 25,000 pesos, or about $525, as additional capital for her rice trading business and pig fattening venture. The loan was paid in weekly installments and was repaid without delay. For this loan, Leonora's 16th, she is requesting 29,000 pesos, or about $625, to be used as additional capital for her businesses. Income resulting from the loan will be used for the education of her children and daily household expenses.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to surpassing their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project

Winter temperatures can average -20 Celsius.  60% of the city population live in tents called gers, with wooden frames covered by layers of wool felt. On average, households located in the Ger Districts use 5 tons of coal and 1.5 tons of wood per year. 60% of the pollution in the city during the heating season is attributed to coal burned in the Ger Districts. The bottom fifth quintile spend as much as 40% of their monthly winter income on heating fuels.\r\n\r\nXacBank has worked with MicroEnergy Credits to launch a line of eco-products consisting of energy efficient stoves and ger blankets, which will reduce energy consumption.

She is married to Andres, age 55, and they have five children together: Alejandro (15), Paulo (14), Ever (11), Ana (10) and Lucio, who is 8. Although she can't read or write, she has no patience for discrimination. She has a great attitude that has earned her plenty of respect from everyone she knows, both young and old. Bertha and her husband have been farming coffee, bananas and maize for about 10 years. In order to better tend the crops, her husband often sleeps in a hut out on the fields. Bertha looks after the business end of things, but also helps with the crops whenever it's necessary.

Crisoforo has two children of 24 and 17 years of age who help him in the business. <\/p>\r\n<p> In order to grow his production, he needs a loan for $925 dollars which he will use to purchase supplies and materials, needed to continue working and to be able to distribute his clients\u2019 orders.

(standing second left with clinic staff) is a general practitioner managing his own private facility in Kisumu, Kenya.  He is 44 years old and lives with his wife and six school-aged children.  He was employed by the government for the first three years of his career.  He then worked at a private hospital for six years before starting his own practice in 1997.  He ran his current facility on a part-time basis using it primarily for admissions, while his main practice remained in the center of town.  He gradually focused his efforts on building a larger out-patient facility at this location and eventually shifted his client base here three and a half years ago.  Besides general curative services and an observation ward, his facility offers a pharmacy, a laboratory and maternal and child health services.  Dr. O. attributes his success to hard work, perseverance and assistance from KMET\u2019s\/KIVA's previous three microfinance loans.  He has been able to expand his facility, increase the number of services he offers and improve the quality of care he provides.  Dr. O. also carries a very good reputation from his many years of good work in Kisumu.  His practice continues to grow as he attracts more corporate clients as well as private patients.  Dr O. plans to purchase additional of drugs in bulk with US $1200 he has applied for.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>\r\nDisclaimer: Due to recent events in Kenya, the security situation in many communities remains unsettled, affecting many local businesses.

At the age of 57 and with an unemployed husband, she needs to be productive to be able to support her two children, who do not have enough education and are 26 and 28. Before ASHI came into her life, Arselinda and her family succumbed to poverty. The income she had raising and selling goats wasn't enough for her to be able to finance her family's daily needs. Goat is not salable in the province and not as expensive when sold to people unless one has a large volume of goats for selling.\r\n\r\nThrough loans, she was empowered to start up another business fattening hogs in addition to her current business. This business gives her profits as much as double the capital. However, she wanted to request a much bigger loan to be able to grow her business further and to be able to make it more sustainable with larger profits. Arselinda also wants to reinvest her profits into opening a variety store in the next few years.\r\n\r\nFor her personal and family life, she wishes that she will be able to build a concrete house for better

She is 24 years old and married with four school-aged children. To make a living, Romelyn has a business making and selling breads, cakes and hotcakes. She has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 20000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Romelyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make her baked goods. This will be the first loan taken out by Romelyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC: GDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nLodivina is married and has two infant-aged children. To make a living, Lodivina owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Lodivina has been engaged in her business for over 11 years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Lodivina joined  Kiva partner ASKI in order to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lodivina is requesting a new loan of 32,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the firstt loan taken out by Lodivina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1650,"image":{"id":720424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizers such as manure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Cabisera 17-21, Ilagan, Isabela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":123,"posted_date":"2011-03-11T19:58:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1650,"lender_count":58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lodivina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilibeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":71000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":71000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1650,"local_amount":71000,"processed_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-18T07:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":71849.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216836338}],"funded_date":"2011-03-15T20:08:11Z","paid_date":"2011-07-18T07:50:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emina Tudakovic","image":825486}},{"id":285256,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose A. is a fishmonger from the village Ntranoa, near the fishing town of Elmina.

Even though the value of her fixed assets has not increased, her business generates good profitability from her sales and a high product turnover.  Her customer base has increased because the celebration of love and friendship (the Colombian equivalent of Valentine\u2019s Day) is in progress.  During this time, her sales rebound throughout the entire month and she acquires new customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor this reason, she is applying for a Kiva loan.  Elsa will use the money to buy merchandise for her outstanding orders such as stationery, Valentine and friendship cards, sandals, accessories, and other products that have high turnover.  When she started her business, Elsa only sold candy from a small space.   She then received a request from a customer who wanted to buy an iron, so she gradually began offering other merchandise to neighbors, housewives, relatives, and friends.  Her customers have even referred new buyers to her.  As a result of disciplined work, Elsa used her earnings to buy display cabinets and order more goods to achieve the wide variety that she offers today.

He has learned to raise them well so that he can market them. Sharifjon is married and has 4 children to provide for. To support his family, he has to invest in his livestock business and, consequently, he's approached IMON International to apply for a loan that will allow him to purchase calves and feed for them, which will, in turn, increase his income from the milk, meat, horns, etc. that cattle provide. <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<P>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

They are semi-literate, but they have great desires to improve.  These women shop every Monday; it is the best day to stock up, after the week end the sales are better.\r\n\r\nJosefa del Carmen P.

On the menu you will find dishes like the traditional rice and beans, tamales, meat, roasted chicken and pork, tajadas (fried plantain slices) with cheese, etc.  She works with Adim because one of the customers encouraged her to join a supportive group.

Flora is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Flora joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Flora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000.00 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional animals. Flora is requesting a new loan of 3000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional animals. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Flora from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She also plans to buy a canter truck to hasten the delivery of her products to different locations. She is 34 year-old Yolanda D., who lives in the village of Brgy. Guimbala-on Silay City Negros Occidental. \r\n<p>\r\nHer husband Welfredo drives the jeep they own to deliver the soft drinks that they sell on a wholesale basis to different vendors around town. Yolanda also sells the soft drinks retail to her neighbors. \r\n<p>\r\nThe couple has 4 children who are between 6 and 18 years old. They all go to school at present. Yolanda and Welfredo already had this business even before she joined NWTF Project Dungganon in 2006, but it was the need for more capital to fund their expanding operations that prompted her to join. With the help of her loans she is able to purchase larger quantities of soft drinks to distribute to a network of regular stores that they have developed a relationship with over the years. \r\n<p>\r\nTo supplement their income, Yolanda also sells fruits, such as bananas, and used clothes in the store adjacent to her house. She earns about PHP 9,550 from her business activities and it helps a lot in paying for the education of her children and defraying the household expenses while allowing her to save up for the future.\r\n<p>\r\nIn her previous loan Php 23,000, she used it as additional working capital for her wholesale and retailing of soft drinks. The said amount was fully paid within her loan term, and contributed to the maintenance of her good credit performance with NWTF-Project Dungganon. Now she borrowing  for her 8th cycle loan the amount of Php 25,000 which she intends to use to fund the buying and selling of bananas and purchase soft drinks in bulk. The income from it will be used to take the next steps in her journey toward the fulfillment of her dreams.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros  Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project \"Dungganon\" (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\").

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMarites is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Marites owns and operates a furniture-making business in the manufacturing sector. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from making and selling dining furniture to local businesses and community members. Marites has been engaged in her business for over fifteen years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Marites joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marites is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which she will use to purchase raw materials to make additional furniture. This loan will be Marites's first loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees for her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

The owner, Ernestina C. R., 52, is a stout-hearted woman who provides careful attention to every person who enters this business, which has given her everything and to which she has dedicated herself.  Ever since she was left a widow with 3 children, she has been responsible for all of the income and decisions of the home.  Through her efforts she has managed to put her children through school.  Already one of them is a professional, and he has a  family and a new income to cover the household expenses.  Ernestina's business meets the needs of neighboring families, who use it to access grocery products that are typically bought by local households.  She needs a loan in the amount of $2.3 million Colombian pesos to invest in the purchase of cooking oil, rice, grains, drinks, and meats, in particular.  This is her 3rd loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo; with the loans she has taken from this organization she has managed to increase her sales and support the education of her children.  Her dream is to see her two unmarried children become professionals and have the possibility of a better future.  Ernestina takes great care to improve the services to her customers so that her business will be sustainable in the market and her income will increase over time.  Her greatest challenge was being left alone with 3 children after the death of her husband.  She wants to expand her ability to receive credit so that she can provide a better offering of products to her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva

Her husband, Samuel R., 46, works as a carpenter, and they have five children ranging in age from 13 to 26 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nJosephine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 13000, thereby uplifting the family's standard of living.  In order to continue to save up for her planned business expansion, Josephine is requesting her sixth loan in the amount of PHP 17000 as additional working capital for her enterprises.  Josephine R. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.<p>\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking  the link to the   NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our
