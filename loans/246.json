It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She wants to increase the number of chairs she has because of the high customer demand for renting chairs for their parties in this season. The amount of money she has isn't enough to pay, so she needs to take a loan of $3,000 from FATEN. When Fatema gets the loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will purchase chairs and increase the number of rental chairs.

Both of her daughters are married and on their own. Since 2000, Altantsetseg has made a living selling children\u2019s clothing at the largest outdoor market in Mongolia. She started out by renting a small stall but has done a good job of increasing her capital and attracting more customers. Today she has many regular customers who enjoy doing business with her. She is applying for a loan for 1,200,000 MNT (Mongolian Tugriks) to buy more children\u2019s clothes to sell this autumn and winter.

Subsistence is always a battle in this arid region, where most people still depend on rain-fed cultivation of their staple crops: millet, yams and peanuts.  Investment in irrigation here can improve crop yields dramatically, increasing the surplus that the villagers sell for much-needed cash.  The leader of the Thialene group, Alioune S., describes their plan to invest loan funds in an irrigation pump:  \r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThe loan will be used to provide the group members with an irrigation pump with a capacity of 300 cubic meters per hour, which can irrigate 10 hectares of land.  The pump will be managed by a maintenance person who will take charge of ensuring its good working condition.  The team overseeing this project will make regular visits to all the fields where the pump is being used, and as soon as the first harvests begin we will start to collect the loan repayment without any difficulty.\u201d \r\n\r\n<p>Original French:  \r\n\r\n<p>\"Il s\u2019agit de mettre \u00e0 la disposition des membres du groupement un groupe moto pompe d\u2019une capacit\u00e9 de 300m3\/heure pouvant irrigu\u00e9 10 ha de culture et sera g\u00e9r\u00e9 par un pompiste qui assurera l\u2019entretien et le fonctionnement.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities.  Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members.  However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income.  This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.  Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":1744,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Irrigation pump","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Nder","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.255 -15.887222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2006-11-04T17:46:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alioune","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-11-19T03:13:17Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":975,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":294,"local_amount":294,"processed_date":"2007-03-21T02:06:28Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":294,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10817},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-04-16T21:55:14Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13108},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:56:09Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16912},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:56:29Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16928},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:56:43Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16944},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:56:58Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16960},{"amount":40,"local_amount":40,"processed_date":"2007-05-29T19:35:26Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":18496},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T04:03:39Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41445},{"amount":20,"local_amount":20,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T17:04:48Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50186},{"amount":855,"local_amount":855,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:40:58Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-08T18:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":855,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63339}],"funded_date":"2006-11-05T03:13:17Z","paid_date":"2007-10-06T00:40:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":5437,"name":"Abigail","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Abigail is a hairdresser.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Winter temperatures can average -20 Celsius. Sixty percent of the city population live in tents called gers, with wooden frames covered by layers of wool felt. On average, households located in the Ger Districts use 5 tons of coal and 1.5 tons of wood per year. Sixty percent of the pollution in the city during the heating season is attributed to coal burned in the Ger Districts. The bottom fifth spend as much as 40% of their monthly winter income on heating fuels.\r\n\r\nXacBank has worked with MicroEnergy Credits to launch a line of eco-products consisting of energy efficient stoves and ger blankets, which will reduce energy consumption.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":483045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Kalala has many years of experience in this business.  Kalala needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Kalala joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Kalala's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Kalala P. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Development Group-Lugazi. She is 40 years old and happily married with two kids, both of whom are attending school in Namengo-Lugazi. \r\n\r\nTo get a viable and sustainable financial means of subsistence that she and her family could rely on, she began her fish selling business two years ago. To take root in this business, she had to use savings from her bar business, which is still a side business for her. In a week, out of her fish business, she makes profits totaling up to 500,000 shillings.  \r\n\r\nUnder the auspices of this loan, Fatuma wants to boost her business by buying more fish to resell and some to smoke and keep as reserve just in case client demand goes up. Just like in any other part of Uganda, fish customers in Lugazi normally have preferences, some an inclination for smoked fish and some fancy fresh fish. The upshot of increased sales, Fatuma gleefully says, is going to be an increase in profits for her business.

From very early in the morning she opens her store hoping that neighbors will come to buy the things they need.\r\n\r\nShe is a very cheerful and attentive vendor, always welcoming guests with a smile and willing to help them with their purchases. What she likes about her job is talking with her neighbors. She has been running this business for one year now and believes that the hardest part is having to spend all day in the shop without the possibility of leaving.\r\n\r\nOver time, she hopes to expand her store and fill it with more merchandise to offer customers a better variety of products. This is her fourth loan with MFP and she is willing to pay all her dues on time, as she does not want to cause problems for the community bank, which is beloved by the other members. \r\n\r\nWith the additional 1200 soles requested she will buy more products to improve her store.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":629635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy more products to stock her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-04T06:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":450,"local_amount":1200,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1259.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349785}],"funded_date":"2010-11-04T19:37:05Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:12:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":248024,"name":"Nicolas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nicolas is 35 years old.

This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing 29,500 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase new materials for fishing. She wants to continue to save up for the future, sustain their daily needs and provide for the education of her children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He\u2019s been selling seafood for the last two years.  He and his life companion decided to go into this business together because of the need to earn income to subsist.  Julio and his life companion buy fish and shrimp in one of the country\u2019s ports every week.  They prepare their coolers with enough ice and place 50 pounds of shrimp and 50 pounds of fish in them.  They buy directly from the fishermen so they earn a good profit margin.\r\n\r\nHe is asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan to buy larger amounts of fish and shrimp because they sell it quickly and at a good price because they\u2019ve staked out a market in the north of the country where fish and shrimp are scarce.  To go sell there they take up to three buses with their merchandise and it takes an entire day to sell their merchandise.\r\n\r\nJulio sees the seafood selling business as quite a good source of income but at the same time it requires much sacrifice so he plans to save up some of the income he earns to be able to buy himself a car to have his own means of transportation and sell his seafood faster.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":894571,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Before joining TYM, her life was very difficult.  Her husband Le Xuan Tu is a veteran.  He did not have a fixed job; their children are all small; and they did not have any fund to start a business.  Since 1992, she started to borrow from TYM Fund but she did not use her loan quite effectively.  In 1999, with the new trend of economic model that focuses on all three components: farming, fishing, and breeding, Mrs. T. discussed with her family and decided to change to his new model.  She now has 3.2 acres of garden, 7 perches of pond with hundreds of fruit trees, and 750 ducks, chickens, and grooses.  She would like to borrow 450USD to buy food for her poultry.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Th\u00e0nh l\u00e0 m\u1ed9t trong nh\u1eefng th\u00e0nh vi\u00ean \u0111\u1ea7u ti\u00ean c\u1ee7a Qu\u1ef9 T\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng t\u1ea1i x\u00e3 Minh Ph\u00fa.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":227778,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To lend money to more people","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-21T23:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria A.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":72727.27},{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":72727.27},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":72727.27},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":72727.27},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":72727.27},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":72727.27},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":72727.27},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":72727.27},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":72727.27},{"due_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":72727.27},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":72727.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":59.09},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.09},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.09},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.09},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.09},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.09},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.09},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.09},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.09},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.09},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.1}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59.09,"local_amount":72727.27,"processed_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:15:21Z","rounded_local_amount":73272.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970802},{"amount":59.09,"local_amount":72727.27,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:16:59Z","rounded_local_amount":73272.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14887020},{"amount":59.09,"local_amount":72727.27,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:37Z","rounded_local_amount":73272.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436280},{"amount":59.09,"local_amount":72727.27,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:30Z","rounded_local_amount":73272.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130552},{"amount":59.09,"local_amount":72727.27,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:51Z","rounded_local_amount":73272.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027349},{"amount":59.09,"local_amount":72727.27,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":73272.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613350},{"amount":59.09,"local_amount":72727.27,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":73272.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010431},{"amount":59.09,"local_amount":72727.27,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":73272.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232742},{"amount":59.09,"local_amount":72727.27,"processed_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":73272.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664558},{"amount":59.09,"local_amount":72727.27,"processed_date":"2009-09-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:47:33Z","rounded_local_amount":73272.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105289},{"amount":59.1,"local_amount":72727.3,"processed_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":73272.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022434}],"funded_date":"2008-11-25T12:23:12Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":79205,"name":"Consuelo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Consuelo is a member of the Manantial (\u201cSpring\u201d) Village Bank.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling different kinds of vegetables in the local community. Alma has been engaged in her business for over eight years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Alma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used for additional capital to buy more vegetables to sell. Alma is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to buy additional products to sell. This loan will be the sixteenth loan taken out by Alma from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Norma Garc\u00eda is 42 years old, married, and has two young daughters.  Sra. Norma operates a firewood business from her home.  This is not a small business since she has to buy large pieces of firewood and is responsible for splitting them into smaller logs before distributing them to nearby stores or selling them at the market. She has 15 years of experience in this business.  However, it is important to mention that she also had a grocery store, but she had to close it down because too many customers purchased on credit and never paid her.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Norma is requesting a loan so that she can expand her business.  Her dream has always been to prepare her daughters so that they could study at the university and provide them a better life with all the conveniences.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

She is 40 years old. Jovita is widowed and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Jovita owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling coco and wood charcoal in the local community. Jovita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Jovita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jovita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Jovita is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional charcoal to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Jovita from HSPFI.

They all live in a little house that\u2019s humble but theirs.  Since childhood Mateo has been farming, an activity that has provided sustenance to support his family all this time.  His children are strong enough now to help him with the field work so the entire family, including Antonia, works hard in the fields.  \r\n\r\nHis main crop is peas since that\u2019s what earns the most income but he also grows potatoes, lima beans and corn.  The main difficulty this tireless father faces throughout his life is the lack of capital to expand his crops and produce in larger quantities, a situation he\u2019s been managing thanks to the coordinated work with his communal bank.

I am a single mother with two children who rely totally on me. I am a very responsible person and am always very happy with everything God has given me. I really want to get ahead in life. Currently I need a loan so I can purchase additional merchandise, seeing the Christmas season is coming and during this time sales are really good. In this way, I'll be able to improve my business and quality of life and support my family, which is the important thing in my life.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Todd M.

She had to search for a source of income since she wanted to provide a better life for her child.  She began the business in March 2007, which is part of a family tradition.  She first started by helping her mother at her stand.  When she realized that she was doing well, she spoke with her mother about helping her to become independent and begin her own business.  She started with a small investment and thanks to God, the business has been progressing very well.  She is already better stocked than when she started and has included canned food and basic vegetables for the preparation of shellfish.  She needs a loan of $12,000 MXN that she will repay in 12 installments.  With this credit, she is going to purchase merchandise to be well-stocked since a good time of year is approaching when a lot of shellfish is sold and consequently she sells a lot of her products.<br

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A wholesale produce business, she says, involves less transportation costs as, for the most part, farmers bring in deliveries fewer times in a given period.\r\n\r\nWith the loan, Hadijah  plans the construction of a much bigger food stall for herself and she also wants to foot the costs of increased fruits and vegetable supplies to her workplace.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":517769,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To construct a much bigger food stall and to pay for increased fruits and vegetable supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Kampala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.315556 32.565556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hadijah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kigozi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saidat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Halima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Takia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":2950000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":737500},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":737500},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":737500},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":737500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":362.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":737500,"processed_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:52:37Z","rounded_local_amount":746162.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136733950},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":737500,"processed_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:48:24Z","rounded_local_amount":746162.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144767232},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":737500,"processed_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-20T07:45:48Z","rounded_local_amount":746162.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152662256},{"amount":362.5,"local_amount":737500,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:46:14Z","rounded_local_amount":746162.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159689032}],"funded_date":"2010-04-11T13:48:36Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:46:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":194801,"name":"Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"      El se\u00f1or Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe H. y su esposa la se\u00f1ora Martha Rangel son padres de familia.\nEsta solicitando un pr\u00e9stamo para pagar los gastos m\u00e9dicos que  necesita su hijo ya que sufri\u00f3 un accidente, lo atropello un carro y la persona no se quiere hacer responsable. \nY necesitan hacerle varios estudios y operaciones, ellos no cuentan con el dinero necesario para poder realizar los estudios m\u00e9dicos que necesita su hijo.

They live together in their own home.  Since she was very young, Teresa has worked as a clothing-maker. At first she worked in workshops where she received a fixed salary.  This work gave her excellent experience in this field, eventually enabling her to start her own clothes-making workshop in her home, where she continues to work today.  Working from home enabled her to make dresses while also watching over her children.  Teresa makes her clothing to order, making things like jeans and pants from other materials, as well as blouses.  Lately she is only making clothes in warm fleece fabric on account of the cold winter weather.  These clothes are often sent to the interior of the country.  Depending on the amount of clothing orders she has waiting to be completed, her daughter Carmen will occasionally help her to make the clothes; although Teresa has passed her clothes-making knowledge on to her daughter, what Teresa wants most is for her to go to school to learn a profession.  In the future Teresa hopes to expand her workshop, purchasing machines and hiring staff, and herself assuming the role of a businesswoman running her own small company.  This is her fifth loan with MFP, and she has always shown herself to be very responsible with her payments.  With the loan that she requests, she will purchase material to complete the clothing orders that she has pending.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":560888,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Comprar material para continuar confeccionando prendas que tiene pendiente.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":104.54},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":108.34},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":113.37},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":119.23},{"due_date":"2010-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":124.59},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":129.93}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.34},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.69},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.49},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.58},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.34,"local_amount":104.54,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:40Z","rounded_local_amount":105.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673510},{"amount":38.69,"local_amount":108.34,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:01Z","rounded_local_amount":109.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887329},{"amount":40.49,"local_amount":113.37,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:45Z","rounded_local_amount":114.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154340},{"amount":42.58,"local_amount":119.23,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":120.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449636},{"amount":44.5,"local_amount":124.59,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":125.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588345},{"amount":46.4,"local_amount":129.93,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:32Z","rounded_local_amount":131.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724838}],"funded_date":"2010-07-02T13:10:04Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":215285,"name":"Vergie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vergie M. is from the village of Mialem, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental.

They live in Malambo, a municipality in the metropolitan area of Barranquilla.  He has a business there offering washing machines for rent.  He also sells fried food daily.\r\n\r\nHis experience dates back to when he lived in Ci\u00e9naga, a municipality in the Magdalena department.  He had a washing machine service there, and his wife ran the business because he worked in a company.  When he moved the experience of washing machine service to Malambo, he observed the surroundings and started another business.  He started selling fried food, juice, and cakes by taking advantage of his wife\u2019s culinary abilities and his strategic location.  The location is in front of the place where the municipal bus routes end.  \r\n\r\nBoth businesses have gone very well for him .  This is because he has managed to buy more washing machines and domestic appliances, which improved his infrastructure.  His greatest challenge is having little working capital.  That is the reason he is requesting a Kiva loan, which is his first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use the loan to buy one washing machine, a heater, one blender, and a bicycle to transport his machines.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to get his own house and to increase his possibilities in the market by offering timely services, more each time.  While this is happening he will continue putting forth his effort to keep his profitability at no less that 56% in order to always be effective in the market.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":787443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Machinery

Being single, she manages her own household while operating her business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nNimfa operates a junk shop. Trash is not actively segregated in the Philippines and, while waiting for their local dump trucks, people scavenge garbage dumps and trash bags for recyclable materials like metal, copper, plastic, paper and other materials. They sell these items to junk shops like Nimfa\u2019s for a little profit. Junk shops then stack, clean, and gather huge quantities of these materials and sell them back to foundries, like factories, and others of the like. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of PHP500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan. She will be incorporating the loan into her current revolving fund, used to buy trash from collectors and for the maintenance of her motorcycle cart. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNimfa dreams to have a much bigger place for her business. She also hopes to have her motorcycle paid soon. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":805093,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Recycling","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to pay for scrap materials that she buys for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-07-05T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nimfa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.32,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2313.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636988},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.65,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:49Z","rounded_local_amount":2891.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005298},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.03,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2313.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764466},{"amount":26.67,"local_amount":1067,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1157.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571590}],"funded_date":"2011-07-05T23:21:45Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":317731,"name":"Mar\u00eda Josefina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Se\u00f1ora.

48 years old, has realized her dream of having a restaurant.  She and her husband have worked hard for 7 years at the restaurant, and both work day after day to improve it.  Before she was interested in opening a restaurant, Mercedes worked cleaning different homes.  She only did this work for small periods of time because she admits that it is very tiring.  Nonetheless, she had to work because her husband had lost his job and she had to maintain her home.  When they had saved up some money, she and her husband decided to turn a room in their home into a restaurant that they named \u201cPicanter\u00eda C..\u201d  Little by little it grew, and today they are still ambitious.  They would like to buy better furniture and expand the restaurant.  On the other hand, they also rent two washing machines to their neighbors.\r\n<p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Laura Westin, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n<p>\r\nMercedes a sus cuarenta y ocho ha sabido hacer realidad su sue\u00f1o de poder tener un restaurante.

Antes de animarse a abrir su restaurante Mercedes trabajaba ofreciendo servicio de limpieza a distintos hogares. Este trabajo solo lo hacia por peque\u00f1as temporadas porque nos afirma que es muy cansado; sin embargo, era una obligaci\u00f3n, ya que su esposo en ese entonces hab\u00eda perdido su trabajo y tenia que mantener su hogar.  Cuando tuvieron algunos ahorros su esposo y ella decidieron ambientar una habitaci\u00f3n de su casa para abrir su restaurante \u201cPicanter\u00eda C.\u201d. Poco a poco han ido creciendo y hoy en d\u00eda ambicionan aun m\u00e1s, pues quieren implementar su local con mejores muebles  agrandarlo.

Ferdinand is a farmer with sugarcane plantations, pineapples, matooke, beans, maize, and plantains as well as keeping animals like pigs, cows, poultry and sheep; that is why his home is always full of commotion, both from people and animals. He started his businesses in 1970 after he resigned from work in the tea factories. He started very small, and a few years down the road, he did not regret his move. But again, life these days is more favorable, as he is able to get money to employ labor on his farms as well as paying school fees for his children and grand children. He is a married man with 7 children, 3 of whom are still in school. He also pays school fees for 5 grandchildren, since their parents past on.

She lives in her parents' house, and she wants to help them with household expenses and make it possible for them to take it easy in their old age. Violeta's days are very busy, since she has a popular restaurant and she has to run around waiting on all of her customers. Her meals are highly regarded by the diners, because she's a good cook and, even though she is still young, she feels that she has lost years of work. What she likes most about her business is cooking, which does very gladly. She's been doing this for 2 years and she considers the most difficult part to be having to wait on the customers all by herself. In the future, she hopes that her business will grow and become one of the most well-known restaurants in the city of Juliaca. This is Violeta's third loan with MFP and she knows that she has to make her payments on time. She is very happy with her communal bank and is always up-to-date with all the agreements among its members. With the 700 nuevos soles requested, she will buy new pots, plates and silverware, since the ones she currently uses are wearing out. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tara Binetti, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Jasmine has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Jasmine joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jasmine has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to repair an existing engine. Jasmine is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to repair an existing vehicle for better service. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Jasmine from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

La Sequita is a parish whose residents are honest people who only know how to work and be dedicated to their families.\r\n\r\nWe find Maryorie here.  She is 39 years old, married and has 6 children.  Three of them are adults but five still live with her.  Her husband is a cabinet maker.\r\n\r\nHer husband has a workshop where he makes all kinds of wood-based items like furniture, chairs and beds but his specialty is making furniture for sewing machines.  He has had this business for 25 years in the same parish and in his home.  He works from Monday through Saturday from 8am until 5pm.
