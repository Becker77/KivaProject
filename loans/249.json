She plans to invest this loan in merchandise for her store. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2350,"image":{"id":448410,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To invest in her grocery store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-12-14T17:40:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2350,"lender_count":67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cesar Mauricio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isidora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nelida Eulogia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Noemi Maura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gaby Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenia Yanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Violeta Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karen Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":6800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1360},{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1360},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1360},{"due_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1360},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1360}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":470}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":470,"local_amount":1360,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:15:29Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118064599},{"amount":470,"local_amount":1360,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899659},{"amount":470,"local_amount":1360,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933741},{"amount":470,"local_amount":1360,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661338},{"amount":470,"local_amount":1360,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1360.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694025}],"funded_date":"2009-12-29T14:22:35Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":166117,"name":"Liz Danisa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Nuestra socia Liz Danisa tiene 31 a\u00f1os, es madre soltera y tiene tres hijos y es padre y madre de sus tres hijos: Liz Magaly tiene 11 a\u00f1os, Tania tiene 4 a\u00f1os y Alex tiene 3 a\u00f1os.

Go #1. He is 35 years old, single, and has four children who are 2, 9, 11 and 14 years old. The oldest child is in 7th grade, and the youngest is in 1st grade. Gabriel himself was only able to complete school through the 10th grade.\r\n\r\nGabriel owns a footwear business in the Waterside market, which is the largest market in Monrovia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ikrom is 24 years old. He is married and has two kids. This gentleman is a vegetable producer with more than six years of experience. Ikrom works all day on the land. He is involved in the whole production process, including post-harvest and selling. It is relevant to explain that the production of vegetables requires adequate fertilizer in order to generate the expected harvest. Nutrients and chemical fertilizers are needed throughout the process. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Ikrom is having difficulties getting into the market with his product due to the fact that he doesn't have enough organic matter to incorporate into the soil. There isn\u2019t enough fertilizer and the soils are poor in nutrients. It is for these reasons that his harvests aren\u2019t going well. Ikrom lacks the capital to be able to correctly prepare the land and thereby achieve a successful harvest so that he can sell his vegetables in the different markets. He is hoping for your generosity and is very thankful to all of you.    \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 35 years old, is divorced, and has 3 children who are 15, 10 and 4 years old. The two older children attend school. Recardina only studied through 7th grade, and didn't continue because of a long illness. She lives with her children in a house provided for her by family members and helps support her siblings by sending them money to help with household expenses.\r\n\r\nShe left Magude for Boane with her parents in 1987, in search of better living conditions. She has had her own business for more than 16 years, having started after her separation, and has one employee who helps her with her work. She has a monthly income of around 6000 Meticales. She uses this money to cover household expenses and she is also able to save some in her bank account.\r\n\r\nRecardina has never taken out a loan with another bank. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] through friends who also work with the institution. This is her 2nd loan, for the amount of 9000 Meticales. She plans to use this money to buy construction materials (metal plates, beams, cement, iron, sand and other items) in order to continue working on the construction of her home. Her earlier loan was for 9000 Meticales and was used for the same purpose. \r\n\r\nShe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. In the future she would like to apply for more loans to finish her house and offer her children a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine

pesticide-selling venture. In that season, Inomjon acquired adequate income and that income was used to improve his home and to save for the children\u2019s education expenses. \r\n\r\nBecause he spent the season diligently selling fertilizer, his own land is unprepared for planting. Currently, it is the rainy season, the  appropriate and suitable time for planting. Inomjon has taken the initiative to resume working on his land while selling fertilizer. He requires funds to purchase farm supplies such as seeds and fertilizer. Inomjon is optimistic that his venture will be successful and all his efforts will improve the family\u2019s welfare.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes having been a key post along the Silk Road and having witnessed the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She came from San Mart\u00edn looking for a better future in this red land, and it has gone well for her up to now since she has always worked in her store, and as she has mentioned to us, thanks to her husband's work and her own effort she has been able to build them a house and give them a decent place to live with their children.\n\nWhat Elvira likes most about her work is that there is always some movement. What she does not like is that often some people come who want to buy products on credit and who are late in paying off their bill.\n\nShe hopes that later she will be able to expand her store. She has not done it yet because she has always used her earnings to expand her house.\n\nThis is Elvira's third loan with MFP. She is a little dissatisfied with her group because some of them do not pay on time. In the end they always end up paying, but sometimes they get behind. With the 1000 soles she asked for, Elvira will buy groceries and drinks so she can keep doing her work. She hopes to continue working with the institution since she is grateful for the amount they have lent her and for the low interest rates they offer.\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":856970,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy groceries and drinks so she can keep doing her work.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-05T19:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":154.42},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":155.38},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":163.69},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":168.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":176.05},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":181.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.91},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.27},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":61.38},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":63.22},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.02},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":116.18,"local_amount":309.8,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:42Z","rounded_local_amount":317.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851241},{"amount":61.38,"local_amount":163.69,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:04Z","rounded_local_amount":167.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666420},{"amount":63.22,"local_amount":168.59,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:41Z","rounded_local_amount":172.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621575},{"amount":66.02,"local_amount":176.05,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:07Z","rounded_local_amount":180.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245434},{"amount":68.2,"local_amount":181.87,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":186.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099890}],"funded_date":"2011-09-18T15:19:19Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":334731,"name":"Moses","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Moses is 44 years old and married with six children, living in his own house in Masindi, Uganda.

The most common crops in this area are fodder (to feed cows to produce milk) and maize to prepare Ugali \u201chard porridge\u201d. \r\n\r\nRichard, who has been farming for the last seven years, keeps cattle, poultry and trees on his piece of land. He is seeking a loan for purchasing a chaff cutter. Dairy cows prefer their fodder cut into pieces of a certain size. Not so big that it is hard to digest and not so small that it is not \"fun\" to chew. A chaff cutter solves this problem perfectly. Electrically operated, a chaff cutting machine chops fodder into small, even pieces that the cows will enjoy chewing. The other advantage of the machine is that different grasses can be fed into it to achieve a desired feed ration. This creates mixtures that lead to higher milk production, since the cows cannot select what to eat and what not to. The increase in income from this asset will uplift the livelihood of Richard's family.

Yao Adj\u00e9t\u00e9 was bon in 1954, he is father of four (04) children born to different mothers and is in charge of eleven (11), other children. As a volunteer school teacher, he earns a miserable and irregular salary, and as a result, his life is miserable. After his marital mishaps, he pulled himself together and currently shares his life with only one woman in his village \u201cAlinka\u201d. The village currently suffers from lack of clean water chiefly during the dry season where water becomes a scarce commodity. Women and children go a long way to buy water.\r\nHe is very dynamic and sociable, and as the president of the village development committee (CVD), he had the idea of initiating a drilling to help the population find potable water in the village. The ever growing density of the local population fostered the profitability of the project. The rigorous sense of management shown by Mr. N. with his (03) credits which he promptly reimbursed allowed us to believe in his abilities to succeeded in this ambitious and humanitarian project.    \r\n\r\nOn that purpose, he applied for a credit of $2,000 that will allow realising the drilling from which the water will be sold to the population. Note that in Togo, water is not free of charge. It is sold and at a high price in places where it is scarce. \r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMonsieur N. Yao Adj\u00e9t\u00e9, n\u00e9 en 1954, il est p\u00e8re de quatre (04) enfants de m\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente et a \u00e0 sa charge onze (11) autres personnes. Enseignant volontaire avec un salaire minable et irr\u00e9gulier, il m\u00e8ne une vie de mis\u00e8re. Apr\u00e8s ses m\u00e9saventures conjugales, il s\u2019est ressaisi et vit aujourd\u2019hui avec une seule femme dans son village natal \u00ab Alinka \u00bb. Ledit village souffre terriblement de probl\u00e8mes d\u2019eau potable, surtout pendant la saison s\u00e8che o\u00f9  l\u2019eau devient une denr\u00e9e tr\u00e8s rare et tr\u00e8s cher. Les bonnes femmes et les enfants parcourent de longue distance pour aller payer de l\u2019eau. Tr\u00e8s dynamique et sociable, et en sa qualit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9sident du comit\u00e9 villageois de d\u00e9veloppement (CVD), il eut l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019initier un forage pour aider la population \u00e0 trouver de l\u2019eau potable sur place dans le village. La densit\u00e9 de la population sans cesse croissante dans cette localit\u00e9 favorise la rentabilit\u00e9 de ce projet. La gestion rigoureuse dont Monsieur N. a toujours fait preuve \u00e0 travers ses trois (03) cr\u00e9dits re\u00e7us et rembours\u00e9s promptement permet de croire \u00e0 la r\u00e9ussite de ce projet ambitieux et humanitaire.\r\n\r\nPour ce faire, il sollicite un cr\u00e9dit de $2000 qui servira \u00e0 faire le forage dont l\u2019eau sera vendue \u00e0 la population.

Ernesto Z., 45 years of age and married, is a native of Homoine, Inhambane province. Due to an early marriage, he never attended school beyond the 7th grade. Once he discontinued his studies, he began to work for a civil construction company to help confront the great challenge of being a father at the young age of 16. Months later, once his contract ended, he started an unsuccessful firewood cutting business. He started selling cow\u2019s milk and raising chickens, an activity he continues to this day. Through conversations with friends he learned of Hluvuku-Adsema (Field Partner), who he became acquainted with and solicited a loan for the purchase of egg-laying hens. His income helps him support familial expenses, and his children\u2019s educational and health expenses, as well as invest in the construction of his house. With this loan he intends to buy hens to supply the market of Boane with fresh eggs, as well as sell chickens and milk. His business\u2019 impact on the community is a positive one because beyond providing employment for himself, his wife, and children, he also plays an important part in the supply of animal protein, calcium and other vitamins derived from cow\u2019s milk, thus contributing to the essential nourishment of the community. His future goals include expanding his business and diversifying his products. <p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>Jos\u00e9 Ernesto Z., de 45 anos de idade, casado, natural de Homoine, provincial de Inhambane. Devido ao casamento precoce n\u00e3o estudou para alem da 7\u00aa classe, logo deixou de estudar e come\u00e7ou a trabalhar numa empresa de constru\u00e7\u00e3o civil, para conseguir enfrentar o grande desafio de ser pai com idade menor de 16 anos.\r\n\r\nMeses depois, findo o contrato de trabalho,  pensou e fez numa actividade de corte de lenha e, segundo conta, n\u00e3o teve sucesso. Come\u00e7ou a vender leite de vaca e a criar frangos de corte, actividaes que exerce ate hoje .\r\n\r\nAtrav\u00e9s de conversas com amigos soube da exist\u00eancia da Hluvuku- Adsema , aproximou-se e solicitou um empr\u00e9stimo para compra de galinha poedeiras de ovos.\r\nCom os rendimentos suporta as despensas familiares, investe na amplia\u00e7\u00e3o da sua casa, despesas  de Sa\u00fade, Educa\u00e7\u00e3o para os filhos.\r\nCom o valor do empr\u00e9stimo pretende comprar poedeiras para poder abastecer o mercado de boane com ovos frescos, para al\u00e9m da venda frangos e leite que j\u00e1 exerce actualmente.\r\n\r\nA actividade tem um impacto positivo na comunidade porque para alem de providenciar emprego para ele pr\u00f3prio mais a sua esposa e filhos, desempenha um papel importante no fornecimento de prote\u00edna animal, c\u00e1lcio e outras vitaminas provenientes de leite de vaca contribuindo para a seguran\u00e7a alimentar e Nutri\u00e7\u00e3o da comunidade.\r\n\r\nTem como perspectiva, fazer crescer o neg\u00f3cio cada vez mais, diversificando os produtos.

At 50, she has managed to have her own house. She lives by herself since she never had children with her ex-husband, who she divorced. She is an adept artisan and utilizes the bulrush (a wetland plant) to create beautiful and striking artisanal pieces, which she sells to her customers at a good price. Although she did not finish primary education due to the lack of necessary funds, she was not discouraged. She followed her plans to have a dignified life and to continue with the things she has always dreamed of doing. She has fought hard to forge a good life. She knows that she still needs to continue making jewelry. She has spent 20 years in this business. What she likes the most is that she can make new, creative designs which result in improved sales. What she finds the most difficult is to make the small details to her pieces to make them more beautiful. \r\n\r\nIn the future, she dreams of having her own store where she can sell her pieces with the most comfort and tranquility. It is her first loan with MFP and she is very happy for this opportunity. She understands that she must pay the loan on time and is determined to do so. The communal bank is very beloved, as it always provides council for the other members.

The oldest daughter of the five children is 17 years old and goes to Gurvan-Erdene University in the city and the other four children are high school students. Chagnaadorj's family moved to the capital city from Arhangai province 6 years ago, in search of a better life for his family and better business for himself. He owns a small old car that he uses as a taxi in the city. He also makes horse saddles from wood. He learned how to make horse saddle from his dad and his children help him in making various size saddles. His wife sells the saddle at the local market. He has been making saddles since 2003 and today it has grown into a family business in which almost all family members contribute in one way or another. He says that he would like to make his family business bigger and secure his children's future. He requests a loan to purchase saddle wood and other necessary materials for his saddle-making business.\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

Leone. They have come to SMT\/Kiva Lenders to apply for a loan of SLL 500,000 per member to expand their businesses. With the help of this loan, they can add more goods to their businesses, make more sales, earn more profit and consequently improve their standard of living. \r\n\r\nThe leader of this group is Mariatu K.. Mariatu was born in the small town of Yoni, in northern Sierra Leone. The 40-year-old is married to a professional worker and they have 4 children.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She tells us that she is not always able to meet her customers\u2019 needs, due to a lack of working capital.\r\n\r\nShe received literature from Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya, telling of the entrepreneur support programs and she liked the idea, so she requested a loan.  She is grateful for the trust and values the opportunity that the institution has given her.  She will use the money to buy bookstore items, such as notebooks and paper.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":545792,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Coronel Oviedo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.416667 -56.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eusebia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":2300008,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":172272},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":176657},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":181154},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":185765},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":190494},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":195343},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200315},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":205414},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":210643},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":216005},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":215946}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.61},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.45},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.4},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.38},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.39},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.41},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.46},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.55},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.66},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.79},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.96},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.06,"local_amount":322272,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":332079.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151898320},{"amount":38.4,"local_amount":176657,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":182032.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159638563},{"amount":39.38,"local_amount":181154,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:18:42Z","rounded_local_amount":186666.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166852571},{"amount":40.39,"local_amount":185765,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":191418.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172119350},{"amount":41.41,"local_amount":190494,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:15:02Z","rounded_local_amount":196290.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177413352},{"amount":42.46,"local_amount":195343,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":201287.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182553030},{"amount":43.55,"local_amount":200315,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:15:14Z","rounded_local_amount":206410.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188689471},{"amount":184.35,"local_amount":848008,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":873813.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191428758}],"funded_date":"2010-06-01T15:37:05Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:39:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

She has 6 children from her first marriage, who are all working independently in the city of Lima. Currently, she is sharing her life with Julio, age 49, with whom she has a 22-year-old son, Michael. They live in their own house which is made of wood. For more than two years, Felicia has worked selling food in her restaurant located in a space in her house. The restaurant is affectionately called \"El Moreno\" [\"Brown-Skinned Man\"]. She also prepares sweets and mazamorras [corn puddings] in the evenings, which she offers on the street. In addition, some days she helps her husband cultivate his crops of avocado, coffee and bananas, since both of them have worked in agriculture for 19 years. What Felicia loves most is cooking and selling what she prepares, since her earnings allow the family to live comfortably. For that reason, she now wants to construct a house of solid materials, expand her restaurant, add beverages to her offerings, and plant more coffee so that she can become a recognized and significant producer of this crop in her area. This is her seventh loan with MFP, and she is enthusiastic about continuing to work with her communal bank, because it is made up of good people who have a strong sense of solidarity and are very dependable, like she is. With the loan she is requesting, she will buy several sacks of fertilizer or compost which she will spread on her banana fields.        \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":578439,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buying fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-04T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felicia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1057.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269246}],"funded_date":"2010-08-05T00:06:08Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":224089,"name":"Filomena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Filomena M., age 36, owns and operates a general store in the village of Calamagui, San Paublo, where she sells a variety of different products.

ventures:   abaca weaving, food vending and general store businesses.  She lives in Mantija 2, Mantija, Danao City. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her abaca weaving, food vending and general store businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 7,500. Gemma is now borrowing PHP 11,000 so that she can use the money as additional working capital.  This will be her 3rd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon.  Her previous loan of PHP 7,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.  \r\n\r\nGemma aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n About NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives with his wife and two children ages 9 and 3, in an urban area called Orquideas, which means Orchids.  The town was named for the discovery of its many orchids and you'll find a park full of the flowers there.   Geovin's mother taught him about the business and how to buy meat at the best prices.  When she became ill, Geovin took charge of the business.   He's been running the small butcher's shop for 8 years, working on his own from very early morning when he buys the meat, until the end of the day when the market closes.  Geovin aspires to grow his business into a large shop.  For that he not only needs to continue working hard, but also needs capital to invest.  He is requesting a loan to purchase more meat, as well as a freezer.  In the next 5 years, he would like to be able to purchase a car so that he can transport the meat more easily.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":641577,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase meat and a freezer to help grow his butcher business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Orquideas)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-11-17T16:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Geovin Andres ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":75.04},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":75.23},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":76.28},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":78.05},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":81.42},{"due_date":"2011-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":81.75},{"due_date":"2011-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":84.04},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":85.59},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":87.85},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":89.61},{"due_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":91.69},{"due_date":"2011-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":93.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.04},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.23},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.28},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.05},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.42},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.75},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.04},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.59},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.85},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.61},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.69},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150.27,"local_amount":150.27,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:09:07Z","rounded_local_amount":150.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188681385},{"amount":76.28,"local_amount":76.28,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:46:12Z","rounded_local_amount":76.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191379701},{"amount":78.05,"local_amount":78.05,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":78.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195797695},{"amount":81.42,"local_amount":81.42,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:22:04Z","rounded_local_amount":81.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201240358},{"amount":81.75,"local_amount":81.75,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:45:50Z","rounded_local_amount":81.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206106291},{"amount":84.04,"local_amount":84.04,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-20T07:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":84.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211863044},{"amount":85.59,"local_amount":85.59,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:40:58Z","rounded_local_amount":85.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216459524},{"amount":87.85,"local_amount":87.85,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":87.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221623369},{"amount":89.61,"local_amount":89.61,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":89.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226992633},{"amount":91.69,"local_amount":91.69,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":91.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232751727},{"amount":93.45,"local_amount":93.45,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:32:21Z","rounded_local_amount":93.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238555889}],"funded_date":"2010-12-01T22:59:27Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T09:32:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily charnes","image":51249}},{"id":252781,"name":"Ligia Columbia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ligia de 60 a\u00f1os, tiene una peque\u00f1a papeler\u00eda.

He\u2019s a resident of a small town with a population of 16 000, called Toktogul.

After getting his driver\u2019s license, he decided that his favorite occupation, driving, could also be a good means of revenue. Bakhtiyar\u2019s taxi route is between Toktogul-Bishkek (the capital of Kyrgyzstan). He has acquired regular clients and drives up to 600 kilometers per route. Bakhtiyar sees his car as a main source of income, so he requested a loan in order to replace the engine and some parts. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan.

She earns a minimum of 1,000 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\nTo help her continue to operate her business, Pacita is requesting a loan of 30,000 PHP. She will be using the loan to buy more quantities of quality golf balls to sell. She knows that having a lot of stock will attract more customers to her store.

She's enjoyed weaving cloth since she was a girl, which is how she came to set up a weaving business manufacturing all kinds of hats, \"chalinas\", ponchos and other clothing items.  She sells them to bigger businesses, a good option for her now that she's moved from the country to the city.  Her only source of income before was farming but now she has the weaving business which has helped her to pay for her youngest daughter's education.  Despite having lived in the city for some time, she still works at farming, growing potatoes and maize, which she takes to market for sale at harvest time.  The harvest only rolls around every 6 months, though, and the weaving business provides her with a fixed income.  She truly enjoys her work.  This is her first MFP loan but her credit history is clean.  She's applying for a loan to buy bundles of wool by the kilo so that can continue her weaving business.  She will also buy 3 sacks of fertilizer to grow potatoes.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":229209,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buy wool for weaving business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-11-27T22:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santa Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":167.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9957680},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:04:51Z","rounded_local_amount":167.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10227930},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:04:32Z","rounded_local_amount":167.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423162},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:35:09Z","rounded_local_amount":167.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116405},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:44:54Z","rounded_local_amount":167.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011362},{"amount":53.61,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:10Z","rounded_local_amount":165.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44594942}],"funded_date":"2008-11-28T05:00:29Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T00:55:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":79865,"name":"Rashida Begum Hassan Raza Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rashida Begum is a 30 year old lady and resides in a shrine city named Pakpattan, Pakistan.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.              \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":255990,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy stationary equipment like paper, scanners, and printers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-01-21T01:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Caroline","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:39Z","rounded_local_amount":100875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436409},{"amount":75,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:33Z","rounded_local_amount":100875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130681},{"amount":75,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:54Z","rounded_local_amount":100875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027478},{"amount":75,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:39Z","rounded_local_amount":100875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613479},{"amount":75,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:00Z","rounded_local_amount":100875,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010558}],"funded_date":"2009-01-21T02:12:32Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Napier","image":null}},{"id":88057,"name":"Mirzo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"G. Mirzo is 46 years old. He is married and has four children. Mirzo has been providing transportation services   for the last 2 years. Each day on his lorry he transports water to his neighboring villages of Shavkat, Andarsoy, and Somgar. Mirzo dreams that his children will be educated, and for that he is working hard. As a result the business generates a significant income allowing him to support his family. His daily profit is about 120-130 Somoni ($30-35 USD). Currently Mirzo needs to purchase spare parts for his lorry. For this purpose he requests $800 US Dollars for the term of 12 months. This will be his first loan with IMON International, and his evaluation shows he is qualified to receive the loan.<p>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<p>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p> \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

have steady work. She is 52 and raised two children. Her husband works, but doesn't earn enough to support the family. Matlubahon has a sewing machine and therefore takes orders to sew national dresses. Sewing one dress costs about 10-50 somoni (US $3-15), and if she has regular orders, she can make good money. Matlubahon aims to do quality work, so that she can attract and maintain a steady clientele. Now, as spring draws near, and the season for holidays and weddings begins, Matlubahon seeks to stock up on cloth and accessories.

In order to deal with this problem, Mrs. Khon P. decided to ask for a loan to buy rice seed, fertilizer, and gasoline to pump water to support the rice field. This couple has two children, one of whom is a laborer while the other stays at home to do housework. Her husband is in the picture with her.

Vohidjon works hard to cultivate his products such as potatoes, onions, carrots and other vegetables. He works from early morning until late at night hoping to have a rich harvest. Vohidjon sells his products in the market where they are always in high demand due to their good quality. His work fills him with great optimism and allows him to help his beloved children.

Your support will really help him. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives in the Batahola Norte neighborhood of the capital city of Managua. He is single and lives with his father and two brothers. His father works as an archeologist, which means that he has to travel a lot, so he does not spend much time with his sons. Inti Amaru is a hardworking and talented young man. Despite the fact that his mother passed away 5 years ago and sadness struck the family, he did not leave his studies. Thanks to his father's support, he was able to finish his degree and has been working as an accountant for 2 years, which has given him a chance to start on home improvement. He needs this loan in order to build a protective wall around his yard because he wants to provide safety from the crime that threatens his neighborhood day after day. With this loan, he will purchase construction materials to start building. In the future, he hopes to keep improving whatever is needed in his house, which he has not been able to do so far due to lack of capital. This loan will help him reach his goal of living more comfortably with his brothers so that they can get ahead in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva

Her goal is to grow her business into a store and help her children get a higher education.\r\n\r\nIn the photo that accompanies this profile, Theresa is the one holding the sign.\r\n\r\nAbout LEAP:\r\n\r\nThe Local Enterprise Assistance Program (LEAP) is Liberia's largest and oldest continuously operating microfinance institution with 13 branches across the country.  Founded in 1994, the non-profit organization has survived periods of civil war and severe socio-economic hardship.  LEAP seeks to help rebuild post-conflict Liberia through its group and individual loans to micro- and small-scale entrepreneurs, and puts an emphasis on lending to women.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":510248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

At his young age, he is already a responsible, hardworking man. He is going to high school at night, since due to financial circumstances he wasn't able to finish previously.

To gain access to capital she prefers ASHI to other MFIs because she is motivated by the principles of the institution. After several years of being in the program she talks about the big improvement in her life. She has been able to earn profits from her previous loans that have helped her family meet their daily expenses and children's educational expenses. \r\n<br>Now, Marilyn is applying for a loan of 45,000 PHP to finance her transportation business. She will buy ten rickshaw units at the price of 4,500 PHP per unit. Part of her business plan is to increase the number of her rickshaws to earn more income and at the same time provide more employment, especially to out-of-school youth who want to drive her rickshaws. Because of the many blessings she has received from joining the program, she also wants to share these with other people. What she often wishes is for her children to finish college and earn degrees and for her business to be stable and earning profits. Again, she is hoping for more Kiva lenders to provide her with financial assistance so that she can improve her business and help other

She sells basic groceries.\r\n\r\nAna is enterprising, a good mother, hardworking, committed, and responsible. She works from home which is located in a part of the town which is nestled on the banks of a majestic river. The town is also noted for its traditional weekend strolls, simple buildings made of local materials, wonderful traditional food, and sporting activities. The local climate is warm, tropical, and humid with a temperature that varies through the day between 21 and 35 C. It stays the same throughout the year.\r\n\r\nAna is dark-skinned with long black braided hair and is small in size. Her mother tongue is Guaran\u00ed and she also speaks Spanish as part of her culture and for business purposes. (In the photo she is sitting down and is wearing a flowery blouse and green Bermuda shorts.)\r\n\r\nHer life is shared with her partner who is a driver and her son who is looked after by her mother. They live in their own house made of brick with a metal roof. It has clean water, electricity, and a sewage system. Because she needs to expand her business to earn more money for utilities and family expenses, Ana has formed a bank consisting of a group of businesspeople. They run businesses such as selling cell phone covers, children\u2019s coats, alpaca sweaters, traditional skirts, running a welding workshop, car upholstery workshop, selling milk shakes and juices. The purpose of the group is to seek a loan and expand their businesses.\r\n\r\nAna\u2019s main source of income is from her corner store where she sells basics such as bread, sugar, rice, pasta, oil, soft drinks etc. She works every day because there are always people wanting to buy items. \u201cI work nearly all day long,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause customers come at all hours of the day, and if they find the store shut they go elsewhere. For that reason I cannot close, hardly ever.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2028Ana\u2019s dream is to run a mini-supermarket out of her home. She is seeking a loan because she wishes to buy more stock at wholesale prices for her store.

Caren works as a peasant farmer for a living. Her community of Oyombe A village does not have access to clean water. The water that is used for drinking and cooking is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases. Caren is a friendly member of the community, and has been elected Promoter by her village to help its members obtain safe drinking water.\n\nAs a volunteer Promoter, Caren represents the community on Kiva\u2019s website and educates the community on how to protect their families from unsafe drinking water by using a chlorine dispenser system. Caren and other promoters in her community need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area.

Estrellas De Ccenhuancucho Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cLas Estrellas de Ccenhuacucho\u201d is a rural community bank of FINCA Peru\u2019s Wari-project which provides credit and education services in the rural areas of Huancavelica and Ayacucho. \r\n<p>\r\nBCR \u201cLas Estrellas de Ccenhuacucho\u201d is located in the small community of Ccenhuacucho in the province of Huamanga, Ayacucho, at the border of a small river and on the main paved road of Ayacucho to Peru\u00b4s capital, L.. The little village is known for one particular thing: trout-fishing. The village has a big trout-farm with more than 50 big basins to grow the trout to an \u201ceatable-size\u201d. Along the main road, most of the population (which consists of only 20 families), have a small restaurant where you can eat grilled or fried trout. People traveling from L. to Ayacucho (over 8 hours) stop over on their way to rest a little and eat fish. Also, day-tourists from Ayacucho travel over one hour to eat the trout.\r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, the bank has completed its first loan-cycle after half a year of existence and all 15 female borrowers  paid back their loans punctually throughout the whole 6 month cycle. All the members are wearing their reward for paying back on time: a T-shirt from FINCA Peru!\r\n<p>\r\nThe members of the bank during their first half year with FINCA Peru, besides having learned to be responsible and punctual, have also learned to respect each other and to help other members of the group when they face some kind of difficulty. Another important fact is that the members of the \u201cboard of directors\u201d have learned how to manage their bank, assuming responsibilities they never assumed before in their life. \r\n<p>\r\nThe group was able to save over 1,800 soles (about 600 US$) in the first loan-cycle and will continue to save in the future; following the first loan-cycle most members have kept their savings within their community bank, with the hope of saving more.  For all members, the main use of the savings is for investing in their business or for the education of their children. The money is used to buy school uniforms, supplies, books and even to pay for entering primary or secondary school.  Another dream they have for their savings is to be able to make renovations to their small restaurants or kiosks.\r\n<p>\r\nThe loans range from 200 soles, 400 soles and up to 600 soles. The total of the loans adds up to 5,000 soles among the 15 members. Although many dedicate their time to the same business, every member has a different testimony\u2026.. As is the case of Bertha T. P.. Bertha has 2 businesses: a small grocery-store and the trout-restaurant she has run for over 10 years. But, with her 200 soles loan she will buy new supplies such as soft-drinks, beer, sweets and toilet paper for her grocery-store. When asked about her future, she says that everything she earns and saves is for the education of her children so they can be professionals and keep studying.\r\n<p>\r\nJacinta H.

She has always been interested in making ornamental decorations and her sister taught her how to make these and to knit. Together, they have a sewing workshop in their home. Before, Lidia worked in an accounting firm, but since she retired, she has put into practice what she has learned from her sister. For 10 years, she has worked to make and sell seasonal clothing. This has led to new friends, who eagerly await her visits when she brings clothing and decorations for their homes.

Her major business challenges include ever-increasing prices of charcoal and the rainy season, which hinders her customers to reach out to her. Her monthly expenses include school fees, feeding the family and medication.  She has been in this business for ten years and with MCDT for seven years, servicing her 17th loan. Deborah joined MCDT because it was near her home and it was easy to work with it. She wants to use this loan to buy more sacks of charcoal.

He is 53 years old, married, and father to 3 children, ages 10, 2 and 1.  The eldest child goes to school.  Tiago only finished fifth grade; he did not continue with school because he was drafted for military service.  He lives in his own house with his family and does not support anyone else.\r\n\r\nHe left Tete for Boane to complete his military service.  After demobilization, he continued living in Boane District and remains there today.  He receives a pension from the Ministry of Defense.  He has no employees and receives 4,722 meticais per month.  He uses this money for household expenses and saves some in his bank account.\r\n\r\nTiago has never had loans with other banks.  He learned about Hluvuku through a friend who is also a customer of this institution.  This is his first loan.  He is asking for 15,000 meticais to buy construction materials (cement, stone, sand and other materials) in order to build his house.\r\n\r\nHe promises to pay off this loan promptly so he can take out more loans.  In the future, he would like to ask for more loans to continue construction on his home.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

Edy serves people everyday during the school year.  Her children help her with the work, as during the refreshment break a lot of people come and she can't keep up by herself.  Likewise, she needs help during the evening when it is the other shift.  Working like this, she has been able to generate more sustainable capital, which has allowed her to improve her finanaces and to pay for her children's necesities.  Her children are her main motivation to keep working.  In her sales post she sells sweets and various sodas, and her establishment has been very well recieved.  That is the reason she needs more capital- to ensure greater earnings and to implement improvements to her stall, such as adding display cases and tables.  This is her 3rd loan with MFP.  During the time Edy has worked with her commual bank, she has seen the benefits of uniting efforts for the common good of financial growth, and she is very grateful.

Jennifer is married to Lino, a security guard. Together they are raising two children, one of whom is in elementary school, while the other is still too young to attend school. They have been living in Silang, Cavite the last five years.\r\n\r\nJennifer has a sari-sari (variety) store which she operates on her own every day. It is her daily task to check on which items and which specific brands her customers prefer. After her three years of experience in this kind of micro enterprise, she knows the tastes of her customers and earns PHP9,000 monthly.\r\n\r\nTo help her use the information she has, she is requesting a PHP10,000 loan. She will use it increase her inventory of the most popular items, such as  rice, canned goods, soft drinks, and other daily essentials. \r\n\r\nIt is inevitable for sari-sari store owners to have customers who do not pay their debts. But Jennifer strives to get past this challenge to make her life simpler and better. As much as she wants her business to grow, she desires to have another baby and to lead a simple life. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meetings where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":768246,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy additional merchandise for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-05-13T02:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jennifer","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3573.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211195068},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2859.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474109},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333.35,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3573.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221636890},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":666.62,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":714.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005201}],"funded_date":"2011-05-15T12:34:43Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Margaret Rosen","image":null}},{"id":301986,"name":"Koam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The mother of three children who are still attending local school and are dependent on her income,  Koam, 35, is a fish-paste seller in Siem Reap Province, earning around $3 a day to cover her family's daily expenses.

They work together every day from 8am until 10pm, sharing the work as a couple.  \r\n\r\nOne of their dreams is to have an automobile to carry the supplies they purchase for the restaurant and, during Jaime\u2019s free time, to use it as a taxi to generate additional income. \r\n\r\nThis would be the first loan with MFP and Jaime is very happy for the opportunity and trust. The loan would give them the chance to grow along with their business. He will use the loan to buy utensils and tables for the restaurant.         <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elsa  Mejia Connelly, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":290442,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy utensils and tables for his restaurant","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T09:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":251.19},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":261.23},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":268.31},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":282.42},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":291.09},{"due_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":303.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":315.66},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":330.11},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":343.32},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":353.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.72},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.96},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.43},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.18},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.99},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":99.96},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.53},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.72},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.54,"local_amount":251.19,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:41:22Z","rounded_local_amount":252.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012222},{"amount":82.72,"local_amount":261.23,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:40Z","rounded_local_amount":262.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595802},{"amount":84.96,"local_amount":268.31,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:44Z","rounded_local_amount":269.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990070},{"amount":89.43,"local_amount":282.42,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":283.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211202},{"amount":92.18,"local_amount":291.09,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:07Z","rounded_local_amount":292.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640711},{"amount":95.99,"local_amount":303.12,"processed_date":"2009-09-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:41Z","rounded_local_amount":304.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080192},{"amount":99.96,"local_amount":315.66,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:06Z","rounded_local_amount":316.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996472},{"amount":104.53,"local_amount":330.11,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:22Z","rounded_local_amount":331.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841979},{"amount":220.69,"local_amount":696.87,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:55Z","rounded_local_amount":699.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733760}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T16:02:30Z","paid_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elsa Mejia Connelly","image":null}},{"id":100377,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth V. is a 56 year-old mother of five.

Like all single women, she needs to work arduously every day to be able to get ahead.  \r\n\r\nReyna has an eatery on one of the most beautiful beaches in the country in La Bocana del Palmarcito.  Because she sells at very low prices, she has a lot of customers who come every day to enjoy her dishes.  \r\n\r\nReyna is asking for a loan to buy ingredients for her dishes and offer greater variety to her customers.  Her biggest goal is to increase her sales.  The only help she gets is from a son who lives in the United States.  He helps her with $50.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

He is married and has two children, aged 5 and 3, as well as one child on the way, since his wife is pregnant. His wife is a lawyer and works independently. Henry works as an accountant in a pharmaceutical company. A few years ago, he acquired his house in this neighborhood, and little by little he has been carrying out the necessary improvements to make his family comfortable there. This loan will be used for the same purpose; he will build an additional room, since the house currently only has one bedroom. He will purchase construction materials to start work on this project. In the future, Henry hopes to be able to continue investing in his home and thus giving his family all of the comforts they need. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

Auxiliadora lives with her sister and mother in an annex of the store which the family has been renting over the past 2 months. Auxiliadora and her 21-year-old sister, Angelica, have 5 years of experience managing  a store in San Jose; however, they have recently moved to Turrialba as a result of the separation of their mother and father. \r\n\r\nThe sisters have been working tirelessly from 5:30 AM to 7:00 PM Monday to Sunday in their new store to get it off the ground. Auxiliadora says her sister is better with numbers, so Angelica does all the calculations and determines the prices of products. Although this loan is in Auxiliadora\u00b4s name, the two really work as a team, and Angelica will have significant input into how this loan will be used (especially since she\u00b4s so good with numbers).\r\n\r\nIn their store, the sisters offer everyday products that you might find at your average corner store: instant soups, potato chips, juices, ice cream, kitchen appliances and milk, among other products. As you can see in the picture, inventory levels are low. Auxiliadora and her sister plan to use this loan to invest in more inventory and also to purchase a fridge to keep refreshments cool. \r\n\r\nAuxiliadora\u00b4s short-term goal is to make the store more profitable, increase income and improve living conditions for her family. The income generated from the store's sales combines with the monthly salary that her mother earns as a domestic worker, which amounts to 90,000 colones (180 USD,) as the family's only sources of income. Rent is 30,000 colones per month, not including electricity and water costs. With respect to the store, Auxiliadora hopes to earn enough profits in order to one day be able to purchase the store and the house the family is currently renting (the house and store are attached). \r\n\r\nBoth Auxiliadora and her sister are taking night classes, 3 hours every day, in order to complete high school. When they aren\u00b4t busy managing their store, they do their homework. The sisters hope to graduate from high school within the next 3 years. Angelica mentioned she would like to go on to university and study accounting.\r\n\r\nAuxiliadora and her family face some challenges. The rent payments have become difficult to make, as a result of low sales levels as of late. Auxiliadora is confident that this loan will give her the injection of working capital she needs to turn the store into a better income-generating activity. Another obstacle has been local groups who attempt to break in and rob the store at night. The sisters don\u00b4t seem deterred by the robbers, though. Auxiliadora says \u00a8we have 2 dogs and an alarm, and the police come if the alarm goes off.\u00a8\r\n\r\nWhen asked if they enjoy this type of work, the sisters both replied yes. Angelica says, \u00a8it\u00b4s better to work for ourselves.\u00a8\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":545876,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General
