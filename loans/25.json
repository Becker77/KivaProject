As a single mother, Olinda raised and cared for her 5 children.  At one time she worked for the government as a cook during the day, and at night sold what food she could cook from her doorstep.  With such hard work Olinda was able to send her children to school.  After many years, with the passing of time and now that her children are grown, Olinda would like to be a businesswoman in a market, where she sold groceries for over two years.  With the held of her son she was able to manage her business well and it grew rapidly.  Nevertheless, her children grew up and and formed her own families and could no longer help their mother with the business.  On the other hand, one of Olinda's daughters who lives in Italy has sold her mother's sweaters for her in Italian markets.  Because of this, for now Olinda will continue to knit sweaters to sell in Italy as it is winter time, and knit polos to sell during the summer.  As things are going well, soon Olinda would like to open a knitting work shop in her house so that she can produce clothing in larger quantities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jordan Shanker, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":260604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Purchase supplies to make sweaters","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2009-01-26T00:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olinda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:43:52Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14854270},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:47:03Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27084878},{"amount":50,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-29T08:17:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35978320}],"funded_date":"2009-01-26T00:53:46Z","paid_date":"2009-05-29T08:17:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jordan Shanker","image":null}},{"id":89668,"name":"Elvira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elvira M. is a rice grower.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He got his High School Diploma and was looking forward to going to college, but due to a lack of financial support, he had to set up a petty trade through the help of a distant relative. His business was growing gradually when a friend advised him to learn a trade out of the little he saved. He paid his fees towards a technical vocation. With the help of his younger brother, he was able to handle the business and also learn a trade. Working 7 days a week and 12 hours a day, he earns about Le 1,157,000 every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000.

The loan will help as it will enable him buy more stock and make profit. Changes in cost of commodities are his main challenge.  It results to decreases on sales.  He wants more financing and he is looking forward to this subsequent loan.

She is a proud smallholder woman who started practicing farming out of economic necessity. She learned the trade from her parents, and now she honors them by continuing it. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kakwet, Nandihills, which is in the North rift region of Kenya. Joan is happily married and is blessed with a lovely family. \n\nFor the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming. She grows maize and vegetables, and she also keeps dairy cows. Joan has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with the challenge of delivering the produce in a timely manner to the market. This challenge has not made her give up and she states \"I have to do something for my three children.\" \n\nJoan joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She requests a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Joan is from a remote village that has poor roads, and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables, and tomatoes) which require timely delivery to the market. This loan will help Joan to achieve her dream and reach her goals. \n\nFor smallholder women in Nandihills, accessing a financial solution is tough, but Joan feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva that help women. The benefits of this loan are many and one of them is that Joan will never suffer losses due to delay in delivering produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. As a result, her income will increase. \n\nJoan intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike and help with farm work. Joan will use the loan to improve her living conditions and assure her children of a secure future. You can help Joan with the loan she needs and get her closer to accomplishing her dreams.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2049260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to buy a motorbike","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Nandi Hills","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Joan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3440.65},{"due_date":"2016-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3541.2},{"due_date":"2016-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":3644.69},{"due_date":"2016-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3751.21},{"due_date":"2016-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3860.84},{"due_date":"2016-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":3973.67},{"due_date":"2016-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4089.8},{"due_date":"2016-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4209.33},{"due_date":"2016-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4332.35},{"due_date":"2016-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":4458.96},{"due_date":"2016-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4589.27},{"due_date":"2016-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4723.39},{"due_date":"2017-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4861.43},{"due_date":"2017-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5003.53},{"due_date":"2017-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":5149.74},{"due_date":"2017-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5300.24},{"due_date":"2017-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5455.14},{"due_date":"2017-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":5614.56}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.41},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.41},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.45},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.51},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.61},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.74},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.9},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.09},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.32},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.59},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.89},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.23},{"due_date":"2017-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.61},{"due_date":"2017-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.04},{"due_date":"2017-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.5},{"due_date":"2017-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53},{"due_date":"2017-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.55},{"due_date":"2017-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":3644,"name":"Blanca Nelly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>In the city of Santa Catarina in the state of Nuevo Leon lives Blanca.

Unfortunately in these cases, there is nobody to guide and give us sincere and correct advice or counseling. From this point, people who make these decisions themselves, relying purely on their intuitions and estimations deserve full admiration and respect. These people do not wait for the right wind, but adjust to the existing one and act accordingly. If taking risks and making tough decisions are needed, they do it, and thus prove for themselves. These types of people make a difference and deserve a different life. \r\n\r\nM. Nazgul is forty eight. She and her husband have been raising four daughters. The eldest daughter has turned twenty and the little one has turned nine. To provide for the family, Nazgul\u2019s husband works as both a cattle breeder and a farmer. Nazgul works together with her husband and helps him farm their land. They have been farming the land for the last sixteen years and have become experienced farmers. During this time they have built a home and now want to give their daughters a college education. Nazgul has applied for this loan to pay for mechanic\u2019s services and to purchase some amount of fuel. \r\n\r\nNazgul\u2019s partners: \r\n\r\nS. Orozbek, 55, is married and has four children. Orozbek farms the land and breeds cattle. His sons help him on the field and provide tremendous help in looking after cattle. Orozbek crucially needs fuel to finish farming the land. Therefore he hopes that he will be able to obtain this loan. \r\n\r\nI. Kundusbubu, 47, is a mother of two children. To make a living she and her husband are engaged in farming and raising cattle. Now, their children are studying at school, however, Kundusbubu is already thinking about her children\u2019s future. She needs a loan to buy fuel. \r\n\r\nI. Mairamkul, 34, is engaged in a guest house business. She rents a guest house and leases rooms for tourists. However, her guest houses are traditional yurts - ancient houses of nomads, not ordinary guest houses. Her monthly income is around $330. Mairamkul needs a loan to make a tent over the yurts. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

The country has produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. It is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Today it is home to a complex mix of Islam, Soviet culture, western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet Republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve the country's agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For the first loan, Mrs. H. borrowed 2,000,000 VND (equivalent to 125 USD) and used it to raise pigs.  She soon realized that this investment brings good profit, so she continues to use her next loans to expand her business model.  Her business is doing very good.  Each year she sells about 2 tons of pork.  Mrs. H. uses her income to save and buy some valuable furniture for the house, such as a motorbike, a refrigerator, etc.  She is planning to invest in planting fruit trees.  Since she already has a large garden, this project is feasible, and it promises to bring good profit.  Mrs. H. has 3 children who have a job and a stable income, and one young kid who is still going to school.  This time Mrs. H. would like to borrow 9,000,000 VND (equivalent to 550 USD) to continue to invest in raising animals and farming.  Her family's average income is 3,000,000 VND per month (equivalent to 185 USD).\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nN\u0103m 2002 ch\u1ecb \u0110inh Th\u1ecb H. tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9.

She had always been a housewife, in charge of caring for her four children, who are now grown and have their own families. One of her daughters followed in her footsteps, and, like her mother, sells baby clothes. These days, Nancy takes care of the youngest of her grandchildren while her daughter runs the business. She will continue doing this until he starts attending school, and then will return to her work.

In this plantation, he faces an obstacle because his field is infertile. Thus, Mrs. S. Y. decided to ask for a loan to buy fertilizer to support the field to make the crop more productive. She has a child who is a farmer who helps the father work.

EoT borrowers are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the very end of the loan term.

Most clients start to make payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

She and her family live in a rented ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent, in a ger district on the outskirts of the city. She has a son, 9, and twin daughters, 7, who all attend a local secondary school.\r\n\r\nN. operates a household-goods retail business at the Bumbugur market, one of the largest and most well-known markets in Ulaanbaatar. She sells plastic and glass goods and some electronic goods used in food preparation and home upkeep. Her working capital now exceeds 2,000,000 tugrug and with the business profits, she was able to purchase a car for her husband to start a taxi service in order to supplement the family\u2019s income. She hopes that both her and her husband\u2019s businesses will enable them to have their own house in the future so that they can be more comfortable and stop renting a ger. N. is requesting an 800,000 tugrug loan in order to import more household products from China.\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009. It is the largest micro-finance organization in Mongolia, but also has mainstream commercial operations. XacBank has the vision, scale and innovation to develop and implement new solutions to poverty. It is currently utilizing Kiva\u2019s 0% lending interest rate to return 9% of interest paid from borrowers to them in the form of a savings account at the end of their loans. This not only allows borrowers to gain financially, but also encourages them to save.\r\n\r\nTo get regular updates from XacBank, please join our lending team <A

She lives and works with her husband, with whom she shares her dreams, such as having a well-stocked small business that will allow her to constantly improve her living conditions and prepare her for when they have children. \r\n\r\nShe was born in the traditional and pretty Sim\u00f3n Bolivar neighborhood of Barranqilla, where her widowed mother raised her and her brothers. Her mother had a restaurant there, but she was removed from that location. She continued the business next to the Don Juan creek and next to a dangerous garbage dump. Her mother eventually took Imelda and her brothers to their maternal grandmother\u2019s house to live, so that she could protect them and also continue with the business. The restaurant finally failed because of the constant attacks by thieves and the constant flooding from the previously mentioned creek.\r\n\r\nBecause of these problems, Imelda enrolled in university without economic support from her mother, who had lost everything. Since she had had up-close work experience, she got a job in a restaurant and later in a store so that she could pay her expenses and finish her studies. She never forgot her dream, which was \u201cTo have a well-stocked store.\u201d When she finished her studies, she married Javier P\u00e9rez, who worked in a store and shared the same dream. So, they scraped together 2,000,000 COP to rent their first business location, well stocked with snacks, staple foods, and grocery items. However, they didn\u2019t have enough to buy some types of merchandise. Now Arturo Mart\u00ednez, an advisor with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, advises Imelda and her husband. They participated in business training and received their first loan in the amount of 800,000 COP, which was gradually increased as the loans were repaid. That\u2019s how they have received two more loans, reaching the amount of 3,000,000 COP. With the loans Imelda has managed to increase her working capital and buy vitrines and shelving. They now own the store and they have a big challenge: \u201cTo buy a house so we don\u2019t have to keep moving,\u201d and to invest in improvements in a space that isn\u2019t theirs yet. In order to achieve this, the couple works hard and their love is their greatest motivation. \r\n\r\nDuring this season, Imelda planned to receive a loan in the amount of 2,000,000 COP to purchase staple foods and toys at wholesale price so that she can receive good discounts. The loan will be repaid in two months because this merchandise will be paid for up front by customers [as opposed to being paid for on credit]. This couple is an example of unity through love, persistence, and hard work.\r\n \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":452108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase staple foods and toys at wholesale price.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2009-12-21T08:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Imelda Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":988061},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1011939}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":494.03},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":505.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":494.03,"local_amount":988061,"processed_date":"2010-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:35:30Z","rounded_local_amount":996469.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118077180},{"amount":505.97,"local_amount":1011939,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1020550.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123913403}],"funded_date":"2009-12-21T12:37:45Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":167815,"name":"Santos Mar\u00eda Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nSantos Mar\u00eda Luz E.

Despite their being of inferior quality to those she produces, she is uneasy nonetheless.  For this reason, she must be constantly vigilant of the market in order to strengthen her profitable customers and not have any difficulty in marketing her products.  Another great challenge is recuperating her large commercial customers which are constantly being controlled and having their budgets reduced.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael

She is 50 years old, married, and has 11 school-aged children. To make a living, Evangeline owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Evangeline has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2006, Evangeline joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Evangeline is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This loan will be her seventh from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b><br>\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.

Having been born to a poor family, she left school to help her mother with the household duties. After having spent several years at home, her parents sent her on an apprenticeship to learn to sew. She then specialized in making baby clothing. At the end of her apprenticeship, she was unable to open a workshop and thus had to resort to sales. Then with the little savings she had, along with a small loan, she opened a workshop and a store that she still operates today.<p>\r\n\r\nThe baby clothing that she sells in her store is made by Ms. M. and her apprentices. Faced with the ever-growing demand of her customers and insufficient financial means, she is requesting a loan of $1100.

She and her two children make home furniture from wood everyday and sell it to the market. Her husband is a construction worker and also raises pigs at home. The family\u2019s income as a result has been improved a lot. Mrs. T. is very interested in borrowing loans and paying them back in a certain period of time because this method is suitable for the family\u2019s business. Other members in her group include:\r\n- Mrs. Truong Thi Hoat, aged 54, would like to borrow 4.704.000 VND to raise poultry.\r\n- Mrs. Nguyen Thi N., aged 27, would like to borrow 4.704.000 VND to

She lives in Prk. Malipayon, Bago, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. Before she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mrs. O. used to worry about the future of her children, because she knew that her husband's salary would not be enough to pay for their education and other needs.\r\n\r\nAfter she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon, she decided to make use of her cooking skills and set up a \"carinderia\" or luncheonette in which serves affordable home-cooked meals. Her place soon became a popular eating place for the locals, and for the next 5 years, her business gradually improved through her own efforts and with the help of her subsequent loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, which she always paid back on time. Her luncheonette now nets a monthly profit of approximately PHP 8,000, which is a big help to the family.  \r\n\r\n\r\nWarlita is now borrowing her 15th loan from NWTF. She wants to borrow Php 19,000 to use as additional capital for her \"carinderia.\" The profits are already budgeted to be reinvested in her business after some have been set aside for the education of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

He is sweet and loving to her and the children. Despite facing poverty and the many adversities it causes, a good relationship with her husband and children is Rowena's inspiration and motivation to pursue her dream of giving her children an improved kind of life worth living for.\r\n<br>Somehow, Rowena wanted to help her husband earn money for their children's future educational expenses until they receive their own bachelor degrees. She joined ASHI in 2008 and has been able to set up a hog-fattening business. She fattens hogs in four months and then sells them, either slaughtered or alive, at the market or in her village. After one year, Rowena realized that her business profits were quite good and therefore she is requesting a loan to grow her hog-fattening business into a piggery in her

She makes her home here in a simple structure with her long term partner and their five children.\r\n\r\nTeresa is excited to be taking her fifth loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and grown her business. She plans to use this loan to invest in her business selling seafood, by purchasing fish, shrimp, and crab to sell from her seafood stand in her home. She will use the profits for her children by purchasing medicine, school supplies, and clothing. Additionally, she would like to finish constructing her home while finding a separate location for her seafood stand. She thanks you all for your support. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3475,"image":{"id":532186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

V. was born in the town of Inhambane. Her schooling was interrupted in 5th grade, when, due to her family's financial difficulties, she was sent to live with her older bother in the province of Catembe, Maputo, where he was working at a tourist resort. In Maputo she started going to school again. After finishing middle school, in 1986, she got pregnant and had to start working as a store clerk to support herself and her child. Her earnings from that job allowed her to save some money to open a little grocery store. Since 2000 she has been in the business of selling foodstuff and beverages. Her bestselling products are sugar and rice.\r\n\r\nErmelinda learned about Hluvuku from a friend, and this is her second loan with the institution (the first was in the amount of 16,000). In the past, she's had five loans from another institution in the amounts of 2.000.00, 5.000.00, 10.000.00 and 20.000.00mt respectively. This current loan will allow her to increase and diversify her stock. Since business is doing very well, she's able to save money in the bank. She makes 1.500.00\/day (more on the weekends and at the end of the month) and owns the house she lives in. She hopes to be able to open a daycare one day, and to start a dance group to perform at weddings and other social events.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Aline Pereira, Kiva

Her business status at present reads like a rags-to-riches success story. With savings from her first farming business, which she still operates at a small scale, Tausi was able to set forth on this business. Casting her mind back, she says her farming business was not as lucrative as this one. She says she had to grapple with a lot of financial difficulty at that time. \r\n\r\nAs of now, she is planning on building a better family house if her prospects improve with this loan.

At this time, she is working hard to be able to send all of them all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Linda, as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nLinda operates a jewelry business. Her husband makes the jewelry while she manages orders, finances and accounts. Gold jewelry, although not as common in the Philippines as silver jewelry, is still in demand, because of its higher value. In her business inventory are gold, silver and semi-precious and precious stones. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more supplies like silver. She also will invest a portion of the loan to pay the repair fee for the machine they use to solder the jewelry. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nLinda dreams of being able to give her family a comfortable and well-off future. She also hopes that her family will soon know her personal Lord and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She sells chickens to entrepreneurs like herself for their businesses.  People from nearby communities come to Maria to buy her chickens, and they in turn sell them in their own communities.  Maria estimates that she sells an average of 300-400 pesos' worth of chicken in a day (US$ 9-12).  She has three staff: her husband, herself, and her son are in charge of running the business each day.  She supports six people in her household on a daily basis\u2014herself, her husband, her son, and her 3 grandsons.\r\n<p>\r\nNOTE: This is a group loan. The $1,200 will fund Maria's business plus 4 others in her community. She and four other entrepreneurs have formed a solidarity group that received business training from Esperanza and guarantee each other's loan repayment. This group-lending methodology fosters accountability among the members because they all must pay in full and on time.\r\n<p>\r\nMaria is very thankful for the loans from Esperanza and hopes to continue taking them out as long as she can.  Before she had her loans, she had to depend on her husband\u2019s earnings, which were not stable.  She is now very proud that she maintains a constant source of income, and that she has been able to expand her business with each loan.  Just this week she bought a pig for 8,000 RD pesos (about US$ 240) with savings from her and her husband\u2019s income\u2014without the loans they would never have had the savings to invest in a pig.  She hopes one day to build a home out of concrete blocks, and a cement roof; her house right now is made from wood with a corrugated zinc roof; she worries that if a hurricane comes her house will be destroyed.  \r\n<p>\r\nMaria is a savvy micro-entrepeneur. She explains that with the income she earns from the loans, she is careful to both save and re-invest her money.  Buying a pig with her savings will allow her to earn more money in the next year from the pork she is able to sell.  Once she begins to earn more money from her pig, she will begin saving so that she can build a better and safer house for her family.  Maria is most thankful that she has had the blessing of these loans and is grateful that she is being given the opportunity to take out another one."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":71337,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase chickens for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"El Seybo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"18.8 -69.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2007-10-02T16:15:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-16T21:52:45Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-11-17T10:22:30Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-17T09:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82784},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-12-17T10:24:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-17T09:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":98478},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-01-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-17T09:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":117159},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-02-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-17T09:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":137138},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-03-17T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-17T09:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159915},{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-04-17T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-17T09:28:23Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":184738}],"funded_date":"2007-10-02T21:52:45Z","paid_date":"2008-04-17T09:07:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":24173,"name":"Mwanamtama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"MWANAMTAMA is 54 years old and opened the \u201cKilly Shop\u201d (named after her son) in 2002.

The group consists of 13 members, two of which are men and the rest are hardworking and enterprising women, thus the name of the group. The members are people of humble means, but with a great desire to make progress by working in sales of products such as food, watches, clothing, shoes, fruits, backpacks, and embroidered shawls. There is a lot of competition in the market, but they benefit from their experience and the quickness with which they change their merchandise. They are always prepared to deal with the behavior of the market and are prepared for the season. Unfortunately, however, some of the members are not able to enter into this new loan cycle, and this is the main reason for not complying with their payment plan. However, the other members of the group are always there to help them out and to avoid losing members of the group, which is mostly composed of friends of many years. The use of the loan is to purchase merchandise and ingredients in order to meet the demand of the market. The members have experience in loan groups, so they understand the method of payment and the level of responsibility and follow-through that is required to maintain themselves as a group with

y una nieta en una casa alquilada, donde tiene su negocio. Cuando estaba vivo su esposo, ella se dedicaba a la venta de comida y a la agricultura con el apoyo de peones, mientras que su pareja trabajaba de transportista de ruta interprovincial; por ello que Olga y su esposo solo iban a su chacra en los meses de la cosecha. Al fallecer su esposo dej\u00f3 la agricultura y empez\u00f3 a vender costales e hilos especiales para el empaque de papa, inici\u00f3 con este negocio debido a que en su zona hacia falta la venta de estos art\u00edculos. Olga se siente muy contenta, ya que es la pionera con su tienda y ya es muy conocida en este rubro.  Ahora se ha propuesto vender casacas y ropa gruesa para el fr\u00edo, y otra de sus metas es comprar y vender artefactos el\u00e9ctricos. Esta temporada escolar le es rentable, ya que de una prenda (para el uniforme escolar) que trae desde la capital la vende al cr\u00e9dito, lo que le permite en ganar el doble, y con estas ganancias comprar\u00e1 artefactos el\u00e9ctricos. En cualquier tipo de negocio, Olga dice tener \u00e9xito.

Con el dinero solicitado invertir\u00e1 en la compra de casacas para dama y otras prendas, el pedido le llegar\u00e1 en los pr\u00f3ximos d\u00edas, y ya tiene todo listo para sus pr\u00f3ximas entregas.","en":"Olga is 46 years old, was widowed 9 years ago, and now lives with her 2 children and her granddaughter in a rented house, where she has her business. When she was living with her husband, she sold food and produce with the help of workers, while her husband was working as a driver; for that reason, Olga and her husband only went to their small farm during the harvesting season. When her husband died, she stopped selling produce and began selling bags and special thread for potato sacks, which she started because no one in her area was selling these goods. Olga is very happy, as she is a pioneer with her store and is already well-known for her line of work. Now she has decided to sell coats and warm clothing for cold weather, with the goal of also buying and selling electrical devices. This school year has been profitable for her, as some articles of clothing (for a school uniform) that she brought from the capital on credit have earned her double - and with this profit, she will buy electrical devices. In whatever type of business, Olga says she is successful. She is a new MFP (Microfinanzas PRISMA) client, and everyone is very motivated by the creation of the new communal bank, where she has been named Treasurer, and where she has made an oath to successfully carry out her required duties; she is also committed to paying back her loans on time. With this money, she will purchase women's coats and other clothing. She will receive her shipment of goods in the next couple of days, and she is all ready to make her next deliveries.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Sattin, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":284245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Buying women's coats and clothing for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-18T23:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":133.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117232},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:45:04Z","rounded_local_amount":133.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012143},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:16Z","rounded_local_amount":133.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595728},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":133.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989990},{"amount":40.59,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:50Z","rounded_local_amount":133.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211121},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:23Z","rounded_local_amount":133.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640624},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:10Z","rounded_local_amount":133.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080154},{"amount":40.66,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:34Z","rounded_local_amount":133.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996447}],"funded_date":"2009-03-19T00:12:06Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Sattin","image":291435}},{"id":97924,"name":"Makunguru B Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tabia has been selling maize and beans in the Mwanjelwa neighborhood of Mbeya for 5 years.

Fe A. who lives in the village of Tabao Rizal, San Enrique, Negros Occidental, is 33 years old and married to Reynaldo A., Jr. who presently works as a furniture designer. The couple is blessed with five young children ranging in age from 4 to 16 years old. Ma. Fe dreams that when her five children are all grown up, she will have provided them with a good education that will prepare them to have a good livelihood that would enable them to live a good life.\r\n\r\nBecause her children are growing up, the household's expenses are also increasing because she needs to send them to school on top of the other basic necessities. This is the reason why she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon: to get financial support in running her business. She started by selling Ready-to-Wear products which she sold just around her community. She even brought her products when she attended the Center meeting to sell to her center-mates. Her business activities earns her an average monthly income of PHP 7,000.\r\n\r\nBecause of her good performance at NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Fe is allowed to obtain a bigger loan. For her 14th loan she borrowed Php 29,500 as additional working capital for her business. The amount was repaid in weekly installments and was fully paid on time without any delays.\r\n\r\nFor her 15th loan Ma. Fe is borrowing Php 19,500 to purchase additional inventory and to use as working capital. Whatever income she earns will be used for the improvement and expansion of the business. She is borrowing a smaller amount this time because she is anticipating a slower business turnover because it is now the rainy season, an off-season for the sugar plantations which directly affects her sales.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams.

Her oldest child contributes toward the household expenses, while the two younger children are students who help on the farm during their free time.  Ana\u2019s plans include building her own home since she and her children currently live at her mother\u2019s house.  She became a single mother after divorcing her husband.  \r\n<p>\r\nAna has been farming for seven years.  Her parents provided her with a plot of land so that she and her children could get ahead.  Ana\u2019s greatest difficulty in growing pineapple is the lack of resources to acquire fertilizers and other supplies to improve her production.  Her first loan was used to help part of her plantation recover from an invasion of pests.  She thanks AFODENIC for the support that was provided to her.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer second loan will be invested in agricultural supplies so that she will be able to sell her crops at a better price and make her payments on time.

P. is 39 years old. She lives with her husband and their two children in a rural community called San Gabriel, located in Yolillal, Upala, Province of Alajuela. This is a large extension community, with a semi mountainous terrain in Costa Rica, Central America. Their main activities are basic grain agriculture and small farming.\r\n\r\nA little more than three years ago, Maria began selling apparel items. She tells us that her business has been of great help, and that thanks to it she has been able to cover household expenses and raise her daughters. \r\n\r\nThis time, Mar\u00eda is requesting for a \u00a2500.000 loan (five hundred colones) to purchase and resell apparel items around her town. She\u2019s been able to maintain a profitable business, but due to lack of money, she hasn\u2019t been able to expand. With this loan, she expects to increase her sales and improve her family monetary situation, so her daughters can have better opportunities in the future.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is a member of San Gabriel Community Loan Company, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica. This will be her third loan. She hopes to continue growing as an entrepreneur and expand her business. She also thinks it\u2019s important to mention that thanks to these type of organizations and loan lenders she is able to devote more time to productive activities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

She settled some thirty years ago in Adjarra Sota, a few kilometres from Porto-Novo. Married to Kinvoedo HONFO, a merchant, Jeanne is mother to four children, all attending school. She lives together with her children and husband in Adjarra. The couple share the household expenses. Jeanne has not been to school.\r\n\r\nTo meet her various expenses, Jeanne sells onions and yams in the Adjarra market. She also sells these products from her home, and gets her supplies from Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin. Jeanne has been performing this activity for the past ten years, which generates the income she uses to cover her various expenses.\r\n\r\nJeanne has already been granted two loans from ALID\u00e9, both of which were fully reimbursed. She would like to increase her stock of supplies and respond better to the diverse needs of her customers. However, she is unable to gather sufficient funds to reinforce her business. This is why she is requesting a third loan from ALID\u00e9.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva

He is 33 years old and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, Arwen owns and operates a service-based business providing motorcycle services used to transport passengers in the village and nearby areas. Arwen has been engaged in his business for over three years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP per month from these activities.\nIn 2009, Arwen joined Kiva partner, HSPFI, to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. He has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This loan was used to purchase materials needed to provide service. Arwen is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will also be used to purchase materials needed to provide service. This loan will be his second from HSPFI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand his business. \n\nAbout HSPFI\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.

She owns a business selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste in the local community.  Falepau has three years of experience in this business.  Falepau needs a loan of WST $1,200 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Falepau joined SPBD. This is her second loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Falepau's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

She sees herself venturing into the wholesale business in the future.  \r\n \r\nNow she is requesting new loan amounting 24,000 Php. The loan fund will be used to pay for increased inventories of plastic wares to sell. She believes with more stocks will attract more customer in their village. \r\n\r\nPacita\u2019s one hope and dream is to alleviate her family from poverty.

Elena E., 47, is a single mother who wants to achieve more in life, not just for herself but for her family as well. Ma. Elena lives in Baseco Port Area, Manila, along with her one healthy daughter who is currently attending preparatory school.\r\n\r\nMa. Elena presently owns and manages a business selling branded apparel, fashion jewelry and accessories, household items, footwear and the like.  She basically buys these items in bulk quantities and sell them piecemeal with minimum mark-up.  Her customers are her neighbors and the community. Ma. Elena earns at least Php 8,000 net income for the month.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue the operation of her business, she is requesting a Php 10,000 loan.  She plans to use this loan to purchase additional stock to sell and also to buy those items ordered in advance by her customers.  Ma. Elena believes that through this loan, she will be able to expand her inventory and thereby increase her earning capacity as micro-entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nAt present, Ma. Elena faces difficulty in collecting accounts from her customers. Still, she is determined not to be swayed by these struggles and aims to make her business grow. She prays that her business will continue so that she can earn more savings for her child's future.  As CCT community partner, she faithfully attends their weekly fellowship* meetings where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives as a mother and as a micro-entrepreneur.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and repay microfinance loans.

By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical 'pasal' might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. This loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.

She lives in Toboso, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1995 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly net income of PHP 1,200. Susana is borrowing PHP 14,000 to purchase more stocks to sell. This will be her 21st loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000, which she paid off well within its term was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Susana aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Currently she has a bakery business that she's had for years, and which she learned from her husband.\r\n\r\nShe will take out a loan to raise her capital (buying flour) which she will obtain from the market and subsequently will sell in her community after baking.
