Three of her children are still dependent on her.  Her thirty-seven-year-old daughter does not work.  Thirty-nine-year-old Juan Manuel is handicapped.  Her youngest is four and in his second year of school.  Her husband does not work now.  Some of the things she intends to do are keep up her business, get her daughters and family their own house, and, because she likes selling beans, succeed with that business so that she can do well in her country's unstable economy.  She would still like to go on with this business, as the country's situation is not very stable.  She hopes that she and her family can get ahead because all of her children support her in her business.\r\n\r\nMrs. Maria Del Pilar's business is a local store.  Thirty years ago she obtained this establishment in which she sells products like basic grains, and somehow puts bread on the table.  With her husband and children she decided to establish this business to help them to leave in the future.  This is why she decides to stay with the business.  Plus, two similar business sale items are nacatameles and a mill to grind corn.  She turns to this loan to succeed in getting her local store off the ground \u2013 she still has to make purchases from different distributors, and she needs to look for the most profitable place to get the products she will sell.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by HannahLily P, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":228834,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working Capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T22:20:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Del Pilar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T22:23:28Z","rounded_local_amount":907.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9935135},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:36:31Z","rounded_local_amount":907.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14858631},{"amount":45.83,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:40:51Z","rounded_local_amount":907.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20399887},{"amount":46.57,"local_amount":846.74,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":922.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27091875},{"amount":45.09,"local_amount":819.92,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:38:21Z","rounded_local_amount":892.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985274},{"amount":45.85,"local_amount":833.35,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:23Z","rounded_local_amount":907.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445887}],"funded_date":"2008-12-15T22:43:42Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":79685,"name":"Florence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence F., a.k.a FF, is 40 years old.

G. is 16 years old and lives in the town of Zana in the Kampala West region of Uganda. She is married and has 1 child. Norah has a business of selling snacks, which she has had for 2 years. Norah has a second business farming in her village.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Norah has requested a loan of 150,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase oil and flour and pay the farmers. With the help of the loan from BRAC, Norah hopes to generate greater profits and buy food. In the future, Norah hopes to own a hotel. Norah is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by increasing her business and helping her to pay the farmers on time. \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.

businesses. She lives in Danao City, Cebu.  She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2009 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her hog raising and livestocks businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 9,000. Sheila is borrowing PHP 11,000 to purchase livestock supplies.  This will be her fourth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Sheila aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

He is a very cheerful and hard-working father who lives in his own home together with his wife, 35 year-old Reyda, and his 5 beloved children who are the motivation behind all his efforts.  Ovidio's business is growing potatoes, corn, olluco (a native tuber) and peas.  Every day, very early in the morning, he works on his crops since he knows that the better the quality of his crops, the better the prices he will obtain for them in the wholesale market in Tarma.\r\n\r\nWhat Ovidio most enjoys about his work is harvesting his land since that is when he feels that the months of work have borne fruit.  He has been in this business for 33 years and considers the most difficult part of his work to be spraying his land since he always runs the risk of the chemicals making him sick.  Over time, he would like to buy more land so that he can grow more crops.\r\n\r\nThis is Ovidio's second loan from MFP and he says that the loan will help him a lot in making progress in his work.  He is a very responsible and respectful member of his community bank.

Bolot grew up in an ordinary and large farm family, and has helped his father keep up the farm since he was a child. His mother worked at a yarn and fabric factory in a nearby village. After graduating from school, Bolot went to driving school, where he studied for six months. After finishing his studies, he got a job at a local collective farm as a truck driver. In 1979, Bolot got married at the age of 17. At first Bolot and his wife lived with his parents. In 1982, after serving in the army for two years, Bolot returned to his hometown and to his family, and once again began to work at the local collective farm. That same year Bolot's first son was born, and a second son was born in 1984. That same year Bolot's wife got a job at a local store, and they used the money to buy livestock. Shortly thereafter, the collective farm allocated Bolot a parcel of land in his hometown, and, after having sold some of their livestock, Bolot built a small house with some outbuildings. Then Bolot and his family moved there from his parents' place. Bolot continued to work at the collective farm, and his wife got a job as a cashier at a local agricultural office.\r\n\r\nBolot's family grew, and so did their needs. A driver's salary was not enough, and Bolot got a job as a carpenter at a alcohol manufacturing plant. After working there for five years, he got laid off. In 2008, Bolot's oldest daughter was to be married, and Bolot had to sell some of his livestock to marry off his daughter and put together a dowry for her.\r\n\r\nRight now, thanks to his persistence and industriousness, Bolot has 3 milking cows and 18 sheep on his farm. In order to increase his livestock headcount, Bolot has gone to Bai Tushum and Partners for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS) to purchase more livestock. Bolot's short-term plans include building a large barn and increasing his livestock headcount.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":963574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Sarybulak village","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-12-28T13:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bolot","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2012-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":762.5},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":762.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":762.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T08:57:52Z","rounded_local_amount":35535.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294285460},{"amount":762.5,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":35535.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331070956}],"funded_date":"2011-12-29T19:12:47Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:02:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Peter and Lynne Weil","image":null}},{"id":379678,"name":"Claudia Marisol","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Claudia Marisol tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad, casada, tiene 3 hijos de 15, 10 y 8 a\u00f1os de edad, los 3 estudian, vive en la Colonia las Torres de Choloma, Cortes.

On his farm he cultivates rice and soy beans while also raising cattle. He and his wife work very diligently on the farm in order to feed their two kids who are 8 and 13 years old. His wife also makes cheese and sells milk produced from their cows. Primarily though, they sustain their family with their rice production as most people from the area do. They hope to invest in fertilizer and seeds in order to increase their crop output. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miguel is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":35665,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Farm Rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-11T18:01:39Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miguel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-31T17:56:54Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-12T22:23:47Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T20:26:39Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31433},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:29:00Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T20:26:39Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40407},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T19:40:24Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T20:26:39Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53263},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-29T23:26:02Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T20:26:39Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73632},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T00:35:49Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T20:26:39Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":88535},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T17:44:38Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T20:26:39Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99031}],"funded_date":"2007-05-17T17:56:54Z","paid_date":"2007-12-18T17:44:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14141,"name":"Farima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Farima lives in district 15 of Kabul, Afghanistan.

They have 3 children, ages 18, 13 and 9; the oldest works and helps with the household expenses; the other two go to school and in their free time they help working the land.

She lives in the middle of Turi, which means \u201cbrother\u201d in Quechua, parish.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and boasts a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns her living through operating her general store and by the buying and selling of rice and corn.\r\n\r\nAlma\u2019s husband, Nelson, who is 57 years old, helps his wife in the business and also maintains a job where he earns about $226 month.  They have two children who are 28 and 32 years old and have their own families.\r\n\r\nAlma joined the Kiva field partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in September of 2006 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in her general store and through the buying and selling of rice and corn. Now she earns an average monthly income of $226 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nAlma is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of 18,000 PHP was used to fund the operations of her general store and the buying and selling of rice and corn.  It had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now borrowing her 7th loan, in the amount of 21,000 PHP, she intends to use it on her general store and also on her business of buying and selling rice and corn. Alma is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":484388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

age 27, lives with his wife, their two small daughters (ages one and three) and his mother in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. His family lives in a \"ger,\" a traditional Mongolian felt tent, in the outer ger districts of the city. His mother is retired, so she babysits Erdenedalai\u2019s kids and stays at home. \r\n\r\nErdenedalai supports his family by operating a clothing retail stall at Narantuul, the largest outdoor market in Mongolia with the help of his wife.\r\n\r\nWhen he first began his business, he had 1,800,000 MNT in working capital in 2006. At the beginning stages of his business, he rented a stall at Narantuul from another person who had a rental contract with Narantuul. This was an unstable business situation for him because the middleman could dismiss him at any time. Usually, it is very difficult to obtain a rental contract with Narantuul because the stalls are in such high demand. However, in 2008, Erdenedalai had the opportunity to sign a rental contract directly with Narantuul in order to make his business more stable.\r\n\r\nAs a result of his hard work, today he has 3,000,000 MNT in his working capital. Besides that, with the profit of her business, he bought a used car, as transportation has became an essential need for his family. Erdenedalai is requesting a loan of 500,000 MNT in order to purchase more clothes for spring. \r\n\r\nHis goal for 2011 is to build his own house, where his family can enjoy better living conditions.

Thanks to Javier's work, they have succeeded in locating and buying a plot of land on which they built the small house they currently live in, which is located in the zone of Alto Cotapachi in the city of Cochabamba. Costa's primary activity is the raising and sale of pigs. She buys small pigs, and then she fattens them and sells them at a higher price. In this way, she generates more income in order to sustain her children. The purpose of this loan is to buy pigs. Since she sold all of her pigs during the Christmas season, this loan will greatly help her by letting her buy more pigs. She will fatten them and this way generate more income.

K. is a young entrepreneur, aged 30. She is married with three children aged six, four and two years. Her first-born is in primary one while the rest spend their time with their grandmother. <p>Juliet sells matoke (green bananas), a staple food for Baganda and Banyankore. There is ready market because a big percentage of the population in Kampala eat matoke. In addition to matoke, she sells tomatoes, onions and cassava at wholesale.

By the quality of his work, he manages to earn the trust of many people and certain governmental and private organizations.  Married and the father of three, he lives with his small family in An\u00e9ho, where he practices his trade.  Though he is in high demand and works at many locations in the prefecture, he is no longer able to oversee the jobs for which he often mobilizes his apprentices and master masons.  His spotty work site coverage is the source of discontent for people who entrust their projects to him.  To facilitate the trips he makes to coordinate and supervise his work sites, he needs a means of adequate transport.

Josefina also accepts laundry business whenever she is not in the market and this gives her an extra income. \r\n\r\nJosefina is requesting a loan of PHP5,000 as her additional capital to further grow her business. She will use it to buy more vegetables to sell in the market. This will help her earn more income to use for the allowances of her children who are all studying.\r\n\r\nJosefina is very blessed to have five intelligent children. Her three elder children are scholars of the Local Government Unit and she is only supporting the tuition fees of her two younger children who are both in elementary school. Josefina is married to Felomeno, who earns an income being a caretaker of an eight-hectare farm. The couple hopes for a good future for their child. That\u2019s why they also do their part as parents to provide their other needs.

Bawji goes door to door selling African attire and ladies hand bags. She incurs transport costs to and from buying African attire and ladies hand bags from DRC (Democratic Republic of Congo). She works seven days a week. She receives an average of five customers a day and sells to all categories of people in retail. Her greatest monthly expenses include feeding her family and school fees for her children. Her major business challenges are transportation and seasonality. She has been in this business for ten years and with MCDT for seven years, now servicing her sixteenth loan. She wants to use this loan to buy more rolls of African attire (bitengi) and ladies hand bags. She aspires to see her business grow bigger, to start selling wholesale only, and to also own a permanent business

Three years ago, she established a small bookstore in her home.  From the start she set it up in her living room, and shortly thereafter installed shelves for holding merchandise and a door to make it feel more comfortable.  She enjoys selling school supplies and stationery because it is quiet work that can be performed at home without having to leave her children.  What she does not like is the dust that accumulates in the area where she lives because it constantly causes her merchandise to deteriorate.  Hermelinda operates her store from 7am until 9pm and also sells decorations and stuffed toys that have sufficient demand.  She is very happy because the income generated from her bookstore-bazaar has allowed her to help her husband with the household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  Hermelinda is grateful to everyone who made it possible for her to access this loan that will allow her to continue working.

She is married and has 2 children, one of whom is currently in school.  She has a business running a salon, which she has had for 1 year.         \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Nulu has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to purchase more braids to use.  With the help of the loan from BRAC, she hopes to generate greater profits and pay for school fees and food.  In the future, Nulu hopes to expand her business further and eventually purchase a house.  She is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by showing her how to learn about customers and to be patient. \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new type of loan to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance, and offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and to give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":593774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Village Bank Loan group consists of 19 people who live in BoE. Krum Leu village in Kandal province.

She has 4 children, one of whom is employed in a garment factory while the others attend the local school. Mrs. Ratha C. owns a hectar field to cultivate rice to earn her living. Her husband, Mr. Ngin Sinat, is a blacksmith in the local village. \r\n\r\nAlthough Mrs. Ratha C. and her husband try to work hard, they still have little income to improve their living condition. Also, Mrs. Ratha C.'s husband wants to start a fishing business so she decided to ask for a loan to buy fishnets for her husband. \r\n\r\nFifteen members in this loan are end-of-term loans so they are not required to pay any principal on the loan until the end of the loan's term. End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK's main product because they are most beneficial for Cambodia's poor, who can repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to. Most clients start to make their payments many months before the end of the loan term. Almost all of AMK's clients make their payments on time. AMK has a delinquency rate of only 0.09% and AMK has a default rate of 0% on

Eleven are women, and there is only one man.  All of them are very united friends, who are active and entrepreneurial.  They are in their second cycle, and they demonstrate responsibility and the capacity to pay.  Among the activities they do is selling clothes, American clothes, selling food in boarding houses in their homes, and selling calendar cards.  Others make articles of clothing, curtains, and traditional pastries.  Some of them have commercial businesses in their own homes or rent stalls.  Others work as street merchants.  Some have extra income from selling cosmetics by catalog.  \n\nIn detail, the members' businesses are as follows: Cecilia Andrea, the group's president, sells food and has 15 years of experience. Bertha has been selling cards for the past two years, Elar has had a cell phone stand for the past three years, Karina is a hairdresser and has been working at her salon for the past two years, Hilda has been selling meals for the past year, Renalia has been selling pollera-style skirts for the past two years, Josefa has been selling clothing for 20 years, Fabiola has been selling food for the past year, Senovia also sells food but has 12 years of experience, Mevlis also sells food and has 14 years of experience, Delicia has been selling clothing for the past year, and Marisol generates income by renting out her car; she has been doing so for the past 10 years. \n\nAs far as competition goes, it is always there.  But, the members adjust to get ahead in their businesses.  They diversify their merchandise or travel to sell in outlying areas of the city.  This allows them to generate the necessary movement to support their families.\n\nThe loan is to get working materials, wholesale supplies, and to improve their homes to make their families more comfortable.  As far as the members\u2019 expectations go, they wish to be able to have their own houses.  That is why they put forth so much effort; they want to give their children a stable roof over their heads.  They want to give each one of them a better future.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva
