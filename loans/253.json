Under these conditions, they've felt financial hardships, especially in raising 13 children. To help her husband, she decided to engage in snack vending and operating a little sari-sari store in their house. At this time, she is earning an average net income of at least 1,500 PHP a month in which is very beneficial to the family. For her first loan, she borrowed 3,000 PHP to add to her capital for her snack vending and sari-sari store business.

With the profits from her crop, she is thinking of opening a shop selling foodstuffs in a space within their home, as the area where they live does not have grocery stores nearby. This is their third loan with MFP and they are sure that with effort and dedication they will be able to get ahead, therefore they are pleased to work with their communal group.

They live together in the town of Quimbiri, located on the edge of the Peruvian jungle, where they have their own house made of wood.  Since he was very young, Sixto realized that there was a great deal of market demand for cocoa.  For this reason, he decided to work on his parents' ranch.  Of course he enjoyed living in the countryside, where you can breath harmony and peace.  For a while, he applied himself to tending the land, planting and harvesting the cocoa produced by his parents.  Today he produces and sells cocoa to the large wholesalers, as his parents have recognized the good lessons he has offered them.  He uses techniques in care of his fields, so that his repeat customers are very satisfied with the cocoa product he offers.  In general, he works with his beloved wife and together they make a good working team.  However, during harvest season, he needs laborers in order to harvest the fruit in an efficient and timely manner.\r\n\r\nHe makes his sales in the gathering centers of his town, and he sells at an unmatched price.  To do so, he works from 7:00 in the morning until 6:00 in the evening.  In the future, Sixto longs to build his house from more solid materials, so that he can offer stability and security to his family.  This is his third loan with Microfinanzas Prisma and he promises to continue to make repayments, as he has with his previous loans.  He is also satisfied with the organization, which offers him good opportunities.  He plans to use the loan he is requesting to invest in the adequate maintenance of his cocoa fields, so that his agricultural production will not decrease.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish

Erlinda has been engaged in her business for over 17 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nErlinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Erlinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. Erlinda is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase yarns, cloths and threads to be used in the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Erlinda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: a butcher shop and salt sales. Her husband, Roberto, 50 years old, earns his living as a vendor and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have three children who are between the ages of 14 and 20. \r\n\r\n<p>Elizabeth joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she hoped for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon and her own efforts, Elizabeth has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 20th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 30,000, which she intends to use to buy more meat and poultry to sell to help her save up for her children's future education. Elizabeth T. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Rene owns a small rice farm in Santa Lucia County. He has lived in rural Santa Lucia his entire life and has over 30 years of experience growing rice. He also has some cattle that he raises on his farm. He has one son who is 11 years and is currently in school. He and his wife, Veronica, hope they can continue to provide their son with an education and have him earn a college degree. They also hope they can make some improvements to their wooden home in the near future with the extra profits.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Primero de Agosto Communal Bank in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Rene is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Primero de Agosto Communal Bank.  All bank members are part of the Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia, and they will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":19323,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Cultivate Rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-13T01:06:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rene","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-28T23:35:22Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-05-07T14:43:13Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15389},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:22:50Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21960},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:26:30Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29294},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:09:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40394},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:18:57Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65656},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-10-11T22:47:45Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66072}],"funded_date":"2007-03-14T23:35:22Z","paid_date":"2007-10-11T22:47:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":10513,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosita has telephone cabins in her house.

For several years he has dedicated himself to sheep breeding. He has attended to this work with great effort in order to maintain his home. He is married with 3 children and has the duty of supporting his family. For this reason he has decided to once again come to IMON International for help in buying sheep to raise. It is his dream to develop his business with more loans and in this way continue to maintain his humble home. At this time he has taken out 2 loans and has repaid them both in a timely manner. Zafar promises to repay this loan in a timely manner, as well, and thanks all Kiva lenders for trusting and supporting him.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and the most famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina (Avicenna). The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, and Central Asian traditions. But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

What she wants most is to get ahead in life and have a peaceful retirement.  She makes ice cream and distributes it to stores where she has a contract, mainly places where ice cream is rapidly consumed.  Business has been doing very well because her product tastes so good.  What Gregoria likes most about her work is that she can divide her time between making ice cream and taking care of her home.  She has been in business for 9 years and says the most difficult part of her job is enduring the cold while she is preparing the ice cream.  In the future, she hopes to open a large ice cream shop where she can sell her product more easily.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Gregoria\u2019s fifth loan with MFP.  Her previous loans were always repaid on time and she expects the same with this loan.  With the 3000 soles that she requested, she plans to buy a new ice cream machine since the one she currently has is not functioning well.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica,

Sibucao, San Enrique, Negros Occidental. She is 38 years old, married, with 3 school-age children. Her husband used to be a baker, but now he helps Aylen run their business.\r\n\r\nWhen her husband was earning a salary as a baker, Aylen stringently allocated the income on their household's needs. But she realized that as her children grew, their expenses would also increase and soon her husband's income would not be sufficient.\r\n\r\nThis encouraged her to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001. She used the new capital to start a food vending business, selling food within her community and in the neighboring villages. She also put up a \"sari-sari\" or general store to ensure that she would have a regular daily income. The business performance was so good that the couple decided it would be more lucrative for her husband to manage their general store than earn a monthly salary as a baker. \r\n\r\nAs their business experience widened, they also took on new opportunities like selling vegetables. Now they earn a monthly income of 15,000 PHP, which is quite enough for the current needs of their family including the education of the children.\r\n\r\nAylen used her previous loan of 21,000 PHP as additional capital for her businesses. Now Aylen will use her 18th cycle loan of 22,000 PHP as working capital for her general store. Income from it will be used for house improvements.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":475175,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Such clothing designers as Dilbar Ashimbaeva, Assol Moldokmatova and Galina Boikova are proving that Kyrgyz ornaments and traditional accessories can arouse a great deal of interest on an international scale.<p>\r\n\r\nGulvarkhon J., the 48-year-old leader of this group, is a resident of  Uzgen and the mother of eight daughters, three of whom are under 18.  Her   husband is a cab driver.  \r\n\r\nA unique designer and sewer, Gulvarkhon's creation is a \u201ctushak\u201d, which is a mattress or a blanket that is usually spread on the floor with pillows on it. It\u2019s a great symbol of Kyrgyz handmade traditional goods, and almost every family has some at home, which explains the big demand for them. Gulvarkhon used to make tushaks just for home use or as gifts to friends, but one day her friend suggested that it could be a good business idea. And she was right. The popularity of these tushaks has spurred great interest among both local residents and foreigners. <p>\r\n\r\nSewing these tushaks requires large expenditures on inputs such as fabrics of cotton, velvet and velor. Gulvarkon believes that her group is suitable for this loan and she thanks all lenders.

","en":"Maria C. R. is 27-years-old and she works as a fishmonger. She lives with her spouse and 5-year-old son in the municipality of Malambo in the metropolitan area of Barranquilla. Maria began this business 7 years ago with $500,000 COP (Colombian currency). She had this wild idea when she was visiting her family for Christmas in her native El Banco Magdalena. She often returned from there with fish for her home and ended up selling them among her close friends. From that moment on it has gone very well for her. She works with her spouse and her goal is to increase her merchandise and sales. Maria is young and very dynamic. She currently sells fish in bulk in the market plaza, but she also generates income selling varied merchandise from her home. She currently brings the fish from El Banco Magdaleno, but recently she has found a way to buy it that is more economical if she were able to bring it from Zapatoca, a municipality in the department of Ces\u00e1r. This is her objective in requesting her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo--that her husband will be able to travel directly to this location and do direct business, which will benefit her and her customers in terms of price and quality. This investment would be successful because Holy Week is approaching, a time when sales of this product increase because many people don't eat red meat on certain days, so fish forms part of the diet of many families that preserve this tradition.

She works in artistic metalworking, creating utensils and adornments out of precious metals and alloys - a solid mix of several metals. She has worked in this area for 25 years, inheriting the skill from father who has been practicing the craft all his life. Her father has his own workshop and jewelery store. Andrea takes advantage of this workshop to create her  handcrafted articles, so she must pay for the gas and oxygen used to work the metals.\r\n\r\nThis business is going very well for Andrea. She has quite a few frequent clients, including workers from the hospitals and medical centers. With this loan she will buy metals like gold and silver and pay for the gas and oxygen she uses in her father's workshop.\r\n\r\nHer goals are to have her own workshop and jewelery store to make and sell her products. Also she hopes to buy a van to move her merchandise and machinery. Along with this she also plans to begin work in another area that will allow her to generate more income. This will be the production and sale of meals for the lunches of some of the construction workers from her husband's workplace.\r\n\r\nAndrea lives with her mother and her husband and their three children - 18, 9, and 3 years old. Her dream is to provide a better quality of life for her children so they can be more comfortable. She also hopes to leave her business as an inheritance for her children.\r\n\r\nAndrea is pleased and grateful for the credit provided by Fondo Esperanza since it has allowed her to invest in her business.

Given its abundant indigenous population the Indigenous Cultural Center of Chile is located here. Independencia also boasts of important historic constructions, including six historic monuments of

They live in Elemighong and is blessed with one child who is below the age of fifteen. They live in a two-room house with three persons per room. Celestine had her first loan in 2009 which she used to start a business buying and selling beans.\r\n\r\nCelestine is requesting a second loan to purchase more beans to sell and also to do farming in the Elemighong neighborhood. Her personal contribution to her business is 25,000 FCFA . She thinks her business will succeed since there is a high demand for the items she sells in the market and because of her willingness to do the business. This trade will help the community since she buys beans in and around the neighborhood to take to the market. \r\n\r\nCelestine has faced some challenges in her life, such as not having been educated because her father was unable to do so. What she hates thinking about is the death of her brother. She will use the profit from this loan to send her child to school and to assist her family with other problems. She prefers a loan from GHAPE because it makes her work hard to become rich one day if she abides to GHAPE rules and because repayments can be made bit by bit. \r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.

has a small farm on land that was given to him by his parents. He has been a farmer his whole life and only has a elementary education. He and his wife, Maria, work on the farm where they cultivate rice and produce milk. They do not have children yet because they do not have financial security. He hopes that in the near future he will be able to make his land be more efficient so he can build his family.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Primero de Agosto Communal Bank in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Freddy is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Primero de Agosto Communal Bank.  All bank members are part of the Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia, and they will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>

The people of Santiago of Atitlan are very traditional.  They preserve their culture even today.  As can be seen in the photo, the women dress with the typical suit of the area that consists of a blouse or embroidered dress, a short or long skirt, a  cinch or strap and a perraje or scarf.  In many towns the tradition is no longer seen so well preserved as in Santiago.  \r\n\r\n<P>Another interesting aspect of the town where these women live is that some years ago the population was harshly affected by Hurricane Stan.  On that occasion, due to the storm, the town was cut off; the roadways were completely closed and the people went for a long time without access to drinking water and fresh food.  \r\n\r\n<P>Santiago of Atitlan is a town touched by the art.  There are many jewelers, weavers, designers and painters at present living in this area.  Inside the \u201cWorkers\u201d group all the associates work with weavings.  Half of the group works weaving embroidered dresses in looms that are tied at one end to their waist.  The waist loom technique has passed down from generation to generation.  The majority of women begin to learn to weave before the age of ten years approximately.    \r\n\r\n<P>The other half of the group do embroidery.  As can be seen in the photo they make designs of flowers and birds.  The time that it takes a woman to embroider an embroidered dress depends exclusively on the work.  For example, an embroidered dress that is completely embroidered such as that of the third lady from the left can take three months, while an embroidered dress that is not embroidered entirely like that of the first lady on the right can take an artisan from three to four weeks.  The profits can vary from 15 dollars to fifty dollars, depending on the embroidered dress.  \r\n\r\n<P>Competition is very tough in Santiago due to the high number of artisans, nevertheless these women can do well.  The loan is a very useful tool that they can utilize to invest in their business and to make it more profitable since they can buy the thread wholesale or hire labor.  If we support them, we are going to give them the opportunity to be noticed and to do well.

Como se puede ver en la foto, las mujeres est\u00e1n vestidas con el traje t\u00edpico del \u00e1rea que consiste en la blusa o huipil, corte o falda larga, cincho o correa y un perraje o bufanda. En muchos pueblos ya no se ve la tradici\u00f3n tan preservada como en Santiago. \r\n\r\n<P>Otro aspecto interesante del pueblo donde habitan estas mujeres es que hace unos a\u00f1os la poblaci\u00f3n fue duramente afectada por la tormenta Stan. En dicha ocasi\u00f3n, debido a la tormenta el pueblo estuvo aislado, las vias de tr\u00e1nsito estaban completamente clausuradas y la gente estuvo por mucho tiempo sin acceso a agua potable y a comida fresca. \r\n\r\n<P>Santiago de Atitlan es un pueblo tocado por el arte. Hay muchos joyeros, tejedores, dise\u00f1adores y pintores actualmente viviendo en esta \u00e1rea. Dentro del grupo las Trabajadoras todas las clientas trabajan con tejidos. La mitad del grupo trabaja tejiendo huipiles en telares de cintura. La t\u00e9cnica de telar de cintura se ha pasado de generaci\u00f3n en generaci\u00f3n. La mayor\u00eda de mujeres empiezan ha aprender a tejer antes de los diez a\u00f1os aproximadamente. \r\n\r\n<P>La otra mitad del grupo son bordadoras. Como se puede ver en la foto ellas tienden a bordar flores y aves. El tiempo que toma una mujer en bordar un huipil depende exclusivamente del trabajo. Por ejemplo, un huipil que est\u00e1 completamente bordado como el de la tercera se\u00f1ora contando desde la izquierda puede demorar hasta tres meses, mientras que un huipil que no est\u00e1 bordado enteramente como el de la primera se\u00f1ora contando desde la derecha puede tomarle a una artesana de tres a cuatro semanas. Las ganancias pueden variar entre 15 d\u00f3lares a cincuenta d\u00f3lares, dependiendo del huipil. \r\n\r\n<P>La competencia es muy dura en Santiago debido al alto n\u00famero de artesanas, sin embargo estas mujeres pueden salir adelante. El cr\u00e9dito es una herramienta muy \u00fatil que ellas pueden utilizar para invertir en su negocio y hacerlo m\u00e1s rentable ya que pueden comprar el hilo por mayor o contratar mano de obra.

A. is a 28-year old woman who lives in Rongo, Kenya, where she runs a poultry business. She raises the chickens at her residence and sells them from a chicken coop stand near the Rongo matatu stage. (Matatus are large vans that function as buses, so a matatu stage is similar to a bus station.)<p>\r\n\r\nOriginally, Christine raised poultry for domestic use, as food for her husband and herself.  When she discovered that there is a high demand in the area for poultry, Christine decided to make what was a side project into a major business. Christine employs one woman to help sell the chickens. Local restaurants are her main customers, though individual consumers are also strong buyers. <p>\r\n\r\nA large cock will sell for around 600 Schillings while a medium one will sell for 300. The poultry business is booming and Christine can barely keep up with demand, selling about 30 chickens in a day.

She began her current business selling groceries and basic consumer goods 4 years ago, when she moved from the countryside to one of Guatemala City's suburbs. She began selling fruit and vegetables and then later, bread, rice, beans and other daily necessities.  When she started this business, it was the only one like it in her community and because of this, her business became a very important one in that neighbourhood.

Five of them are working adults, and two are in school.  Her husband works as an accountant.  She thanks God for the support her husband has given her family because many Nicaraguan families have single mothers.  She lives in the Anexo Villa Fraternidad neighborhood in the capital of Managua.\r\n\r\nShe sells clothes and shoes.  She has been running this business, which she started with her own funds, for eight years.  Later, she got financing to get more inventory and obtain new customers.  \r\n\r\nThis is her fifth cycle with Afodenic.  She will use it to buy clothes, perfume, and shoes to offer her customers a variety of products.  She expects to get income from this and help her children with their education.  She is grateful to the Institution for the loans.  With previous loan she has made improvements to her house and increased her sales inventory.

D. L., 39, lives in the capital city of San Salvador.  She lives in her own home with her mother, her sister and her daughter, Isabel.  Amanda has a small store set up in part of her home, where she works every day of the week selling soap, detergents, daily consumer products and sweets.  In addition, she is very well-known by her neighbors for selling pupusas from Fridays through Sundays.  These are typical Salvadoran snacks maD. of a base of corn or rice that are filled with cheese, beans, squash and pork, which she makes according to the tastes of her customers.  In addition, she makes other traditional snacks in the afternoons almost every day, such as: pastries filled with meat, enchiladas and atoles (a hot drink maD. with corn meal.)  Amanda works very hard each day to proviD. for her family: she manages her family life and the household chores and at the same time takes care of both businesses.  Her daughter, who is in sixth graD., is her main source of inspiration. It has been more than 6 years since Amanda Guadalupe  started up these businesses, and now she has been able to increase her sales so that her dedication, patience and positive energy are paying off.  She has great dreams, and for this reason she requests a loan from Apoyo Integral, with which she aims to have other products in her store and a greater quantity of supplies to make her delicious pupusas and traditional snacks.  Her goal is to obtain better earnings so that she can ensure the welfare of all of her family

They all live together as a family in the house of Margarita's mother, located in the town of Puente Paucartambo (in the central Peruvian jungle.) Margarita is involved in several activities.  For 10 years she has worked at a crate business (a place where they make wooden crates used to pack fruit), and over this time she was able to save enough money to open a restaurant where she sells beef kebabs, hamburgers and salchipapas (a dish of sausage and fried potatoes.)  This business has been well received by the public.  As a young enterprising woman she had a good idea, and now sells not only beef kebabs but also fried chicken.  But she still has an incredible desire to get ahead, because two years ago she also started a business in agriculture cultivating bananas and coffee.  Now she wants to buy more farmland and hopes very soon to conclude a sales agreement, but she will also continue to tend to her restaurant business.  To do this, she is thinking about buying her own house where she could set up a more appealing locale for her restaurant.  Her main worry at this moment is to extract the biggest possible harvest from her coffee crops, since in this season there is a high demand for this product in the marketplace, and this is the time when her crops are maturing.  Margarita belongs to the communal bank \"Luz del Futuro,\" and this is the group's 5th loan cycle with MFP, from which Margarita is pleased to know that she will receive financial support.

Ketut Surja hanya menggandalkan bibit lokal saja ,dan pemupukannya pun hanya sekedar, pemberantasan hama tidak dilakukan secara tuntas mengingat harga obat-obatan meningkat drastis.

All her subsequent loans were used to buy piglets, calves and chicks. It yielded good profits and enabled her family to have a steady income and some savings. Since 2002, she and her family changed their business plan, they started farming cows & pigs. They also sell beef. Their income was 3.000.000 - 3.500.000 VND a month.

They all have the same business activity: buying and selling fish in various forms (fried, dried, smoked, fresh etc.). The Nyetaa Group is on its fifth group loan, having paid back the four previous loans with no problems.\r\n\r\nThis new loan will allow them to purchase 40 baskets of fresh fish and 12 blocks of ice. They stock up on fresh fish locally, on the banks of the Niger River. A good portion of this fish is dried, either on stones, straw or \"seccos\". The rest is sold in different ways: the fresh fish is sold locally in Kirango and Diamarabougou Markala; the fresh fish conserved on ice is sold in S\u00e9gou (at the castle market) and Bamako; the dried fish, some of which is kept until the waters recede when it is worth more, is mostly sold in Dougabougou, Siribala, Niono, Shango, Boussin and at the weekly fair in S\u00e9gou; the smoked fish is mainly sold in S\u00e9gou. The sales are generally transacted in cash to a clientele made up of both men and women, and are carried out locally beside the river, in the Kirango or Diamarabougou (Markala) markets or door-to-door in village.\r\n\r\nThe women expect to make an average monthly profit of 52,800 FCFA, which will allow them to take care of some small family needs and to participate in social events.\r\n\r\nTheir ambition is to save enough money to buy their children a plot of land on which to raise animals.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":420639,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-11-07T15:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Awa                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Fatoumata      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Korotoumou     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nana                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.16},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:57:02Z","rounded_local_amount":68174.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873792},{"amount":154.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:04:25Z","rounded_local_amount":68174.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763522},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-16T09:31:46Z","rounded_local_amount":68174.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152337},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:44Z","rounded_local_amount":68174.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991191},{"amount":154.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:00:03Z","rounded_local_amount":68174.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021458},{"amount":154.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:12Z","rounded_local_amount":68174.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746258}],"funded_date":"2009-11-07T20:32:34Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":154107,"name":"Rolando","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sacrifice and patience are needed in order to achieve success in life, says Rolando E..

Negros Occidental. She is 46 years old, married, and blessed with 3 children between 11 to 23 years old, with the oldest already in college. Her dream is for her children to finish their studies and help her to improve their lives. \r\n\r\nMany years ago, she worked as a bookkeeper in a sugar cane plantation, but she lost her job when the farm was divided among the long-time laborers through the government's agrarian reform program. Her employer offered to transfer her to their home office in the city, but she refused the offer because she wanted to stay close to her family.\r\n\r\nThe new development in her life prompted her to start her own business to help her husband support their family. In 2003, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to get access to capital so that she could open a general store. Because of her business background, she proved to be a good entrepreneur and her business soon flourished and expanded to include RTW (ready-to-wear) clothes and electronic loading (of pre-paid credits for text messaging) of mobile phones. She was also able to invest in a poultry business, starting with just 12 chicken. She now raises 41 chickens, which contributes a lot to her family's income. Her net profit per month averages PHP 6,400 (~ $139 USD). \r\n\r\nShe used her previous loan of Php 7,000 as additional capital for her general store. That loan was fully repaid without delay. Now for her 16th loan, she is borrowing Php 19,500 to buy additional chicks, feed, and vitamins for her poultry business. She plans to use the income from her loan to pay for her children's education and other family expenses.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros  Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the  lives of thousands of women through Project  \"Dungganon\" (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is  empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to  achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a  life path that will ultimately make them \"Dungganon\" -  a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has  earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She is 41 years old, married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Bless owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products in the local community. Bless has been engaged in her business for 3 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2003, Bless joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Bless has successfully repaid a previous loan of 12,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Bless is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This loan will be the twelfth loan taken out by Bless from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Her husband works at a car wash, and she works at a beauty parlor thanks to studying for three years at a local school. She works from 8:30 a.m. until 6:30 p.m. and still fulfills her household duties, cares for her baby and also takes time to sell cosmetic products from the Yanbal, Esika and L\u00e9bel product lines. She tells us that she has seven years of work experience, which has allowed her to have a fixed clientele. This is her third loan cycle with the community bank, which she joined at the invitation of a friend who is also an active member. With the money she is requesting, she plans to purchase dye, curlers and permanent solution, as well as perfumes, creams, nail polish, treatments and more cosmetic products from Yanbal, Esika and L\u00e9bel for women and men. Her biggest dream is to have her own place where she can live comfortably.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":520968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase dye, curlers and permanent solution, as well as perfumes, creams, nail polish, treatments and more cosmetic products from Yanbal, Esika and L\u00e9bel for women and men                 ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-04-08T04:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Zara Liduvina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":440,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":36.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":36.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.51},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.51},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.51},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75.01,"local_amount":73.34,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":75.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674848},{"amount":75,"local_amount":73.34,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:05Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709033},{"amount":75.01,"local_amount":73.34,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:51Z","rounded_local_amount":75.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892331},{"amount":75.01,"local_amount":73.34,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":75.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632702},{"amount":75,"local_amount":73.34,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:20Z","rounded_local_amount":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846748},{"amount":74.97,"local_amount":73.3,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:15Z","rounded_local_amount":74.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113268}],"funded_date":"2010-04-09T01:19:33Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":195765,"name":"Mrs. Phorn Sus Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eight people living in the village of Ta Pech in Kandal province have have made a village bank loan group.

A. is a hard-working woman who lives in El Bosque neighborhood, in the tourist city of Cartagena.  She lives with her husband and two children aged 16 and 12.  Mara makes and sells lunches to employees and workmen on construction sites.  Before she started this business, she used to wash and iron people's clothes in their homes but one of her customers once suggested that she make some lunches for some extra workmen who had been hired in a nearby company and she accepted.  Mara's business did so well that she managed to make in just one day what she normally made in three days of washing and ironing.\r\n\r\nMara currently makes 70% of her household's income.  Her business is located in her home which allows her to be near her family all day.  However, next year she plans to rent premises so that she can make her small business more independent and work more comfortably.  Mara sells an average of 30 lunches at 4,000 Colombian pesos each.  Her average profit margin is 40%.  In order to make her deliveries on time she had to hire her sister to help her chop vegetables and cure the meat. \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan that Mara has taken from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she will invest all of it in buying foodstuffs wholesale so that she can obtain discounts by buying in bulk and paying cash.  Mara says that the success of her business lies in the quality of her meals because she prepares them with a lot of fresh vegetables which gives them an original touch.  They never harm anyone.  Her most requested dish is coconut rice with fried fish, fried plantain slices and avocado salad.

She is a widow and mother of two children. Together with her children, she manages the household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for the family's everyday expenses and her children\u2019s studies. \r\nVivian maintains a direct selling business. She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through popular direct sales brands such as Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct selling brands. A customer's order is bought in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are investing on as their income. Vivian's regular customers are her neighbours and members of the local community. She earns a minimum of 1,500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\nTo help Vivian continue to operate her business, she is requesting a loan of 10,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy merchandise and orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\nVivian fervently hopes that her children will be able to graduate one day. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":965044,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy merchandise for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Bacoor, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-12-28T14:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Vivian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:38:52Z","rounded_local_amount":732.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738933},{"amount":16.66,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:38:53Z","rounded_local_amount":732.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738934},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:38:54Z","rounded_local_amount":732.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738935},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.99,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2929.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146136},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2928.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275329},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2929.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997851}],"funded_date":"2011-12-28T19:12:15Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":380195,"name":"Lorna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lorna is 45 years old and lives in the Philippines.

He has lived in Santa Lucia his entire life, in fact the lands he owns were given to him by his father. For over 50 years Simon has been making ends meet with the rice that his lands produce. He and his wife Victoria have relied on their farm to raise there 3 children who are all adults now. Simon is requesting the loan because he wants to avoid having to borrow from loan sharks in order to buy his supplies. He has been  using those informal loans for most of his time in Santa Lucia and he is optimistic about the presence of formal finance.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Paypayales Communal Bank in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Simon is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Paypayales Communal Bank. All bank members are part of a rice farmers' cooperative in Santa Lucia named Dios Con Nosotros (God is with us). They will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all the guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Dios con Nosotros Cooperative are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":19430,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Farm Rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-13T19:29:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Simon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-28T04:49:50Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":825,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":117.84}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.86},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-05-17T21:35:10Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16565},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:33:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21969},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:16:05Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29282},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-08-06T23:45:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":39725},{"amount":66,"local_amount":66,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T21:03:51Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53274},{"amount":495,"local_amount":495,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:07:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:38Z","rounded_local_amount":495,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65645}],"funded_date":"2007-03-14T04:49:50Z","paid_date":"2007-10-10T20:07:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":10561,"name":"Maqasd","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maqasd A. is an Internally Displaced Person from the Dacqin region of Azerbaijan.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Gracia, 73, is a single mother.  She supports 5 children, all in school.  She operates a small general store, a business that she's had for more than 21 years.  Dona Maria decided to start the business because she needed to find a way to support her children.  She's always been a very responsible woman and someone who has had to be both mother and father to her children.  The loans have allowed her to buy what she needs for the business and wholesale supplies of the products she sells.

She is married, 47 years old and has four children, two of whom are still in school and dependent on her. Bertha has been making clothes for 13 years and little by little has generated income and saved her money. Previously she had maD. a living selling groceries. Since she had the talent for sewing, she didn't hesitate to start doing it for a living, and with the help of Kiva partner Movimiento Manuela Ramos she decided to start her own sewing shop out of her home. She tells us that the business is going very well, and she works on orders that her clients request in advance. She tends to her customers with the friendliness and charisma that she is known for. With her initial loan of 300 soles, she purchased meters of fabric, threads of different colors, and other odds and ends, and has continued with the business ever since. With the current loan of 3,000 soles she is requesting, she plans to purchase meters of fabric of different styles and colors, scissors, big spools of threads of various colors, sewing needles, pins and buttons. Today she feels like a very accomplished woman with a strong desire to keep moving forward and realizing her dreams. She is very thankful to Movimiento Manuela Ramos for helping her start her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":485893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase meters of fabric of different styles and colors, scissors, big spools of threads of various colors, sewing needles, pins and buttons","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-02-11T01:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertha Luz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:20Z","rounded_local_amount":502.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123954544},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:43Z","rounded_local_amount":502.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987570},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":502.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713596},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:39Z","rounded_local_amount":502.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746642},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-27T07:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":502.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151929813},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-28T07:53:10Z","rounded_local_amount":502.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159668989}],"funded_date":"2010-02-11T16:39:12Z","paid_date":"2010-08-28T07:53:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":179145,"name":"Olaide","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Olaide loves her business of selling foodstuffs.

He started his meat business in 1997, when he purchased one sheep with money he had saved up. The work is interesting, but time-consuming and takes a lot of effort. At the same time, the salary he earns is not enough to cover all of his family's expenses. Serkerdar would therefore like to borrow $500 to buy 7 small sheep plus some food for them. He will repay the loan within 12 months and hopes that it will expand his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":67463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Butcher Shop","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy 7 sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"AZ","country":"Azerbaijan","town":"Baku","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.395278 49.882222","type":"point"}},"partner_id":31,"posted_date":"2007-09-22T13:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Serkardar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-07T01:35:26Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2007-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2007-11-07T10:22:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:27:17Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":77909},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2007-12-07T10:23:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93107},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-01-07T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:29:09Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":111062},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-02-07T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:12:32Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130309},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-03-07T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:15:59Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151965},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-04-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":176063},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-05-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":203361},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-06-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:49:34Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":230593},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-07-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T06:05:15Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":259702},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-08-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T06:12:30Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":288499},{"amount":42,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2008-09-07T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-10T07:25:27Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":318798},{"amount":38,"local_amount":38,"processed_date":"2008-10-07T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-19T08:09:44Z","rounded_local_amount":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":350697}],"funded_date":"2007-09-23T01:35:26Z","paid_date":"2008-11-19T08:09:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":22866,"name":"De Las Nieves","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<p> Senora De las Nievas A. de Caballero is married and has one son.

Because they lack tangible collateral assets, women are considered not creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low income. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through <i><b>Micro Leasing<\/b><\/i> as a practical way to achieve economic and social emancipation of women. SELFINA buys equipment and leases it to women. When a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from her, extending her a loan, and then leases the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called \"sale and leaseback\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":113280,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase additional stock in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-01-12T04:25:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agnes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-26T06:56:56Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":33.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34,"local_amount":34000,"processed_date":"2008-02-26T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-26T09:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":38688.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":142751},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34000,"processed_date":"2008-03-26T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-26T09:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":38688.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166733},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34000,"processed_date":"2008-04-26T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-26T09:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":38688.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":192526},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34000,"processed_date":"2008-05-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-26T09:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":38688.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":220221},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34000,"processed_date":"2008-06-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-26T09:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":38688.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":249392},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-07-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-26T09:30:48Z","rounded_local_amount":34137,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":278054}],"funded_date":"2008-01-12T06:56:56Z","paid_date":"2008-07-26T09:13:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":35154,"name":"Mugunza A(Iii) Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The group leader of this small group is Hamida H..

In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Rosa works in used clothing sales, which she began 3 years ago. She was having many difficulties and decided to do something to improve her family's situation, and began purchasing used clothes because her income was not sufficient to maintain her home. She began to sell these clothes in the streets. Unfortunately, sometimes she was not able to sell much, but she was not defeated. She began to offer the clothes to her neighbors as well. For this reason she is requesting a loan for the capital to buy pajamas, children's clothes, and women's clothes, which will allow her to diversify her products and generate more income.

Her husband, Rogelio, is 39 and is a vendor and her business partner.\r\n\r\nLife was not easy for Marita. She was challenged by the miserable condition of their lives to strive hard and search for a greener living. In 2003, she joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, with the hope of bringing light to her family. On her previous loans, she prudently invested those in doormat making. But it is quite laborious and time consuming.\r\n\r\nJust recently, Marita opted to venture in fish-ball vending which is in demand by kids and also by the people in the community, especially during the afternoon. She observed that fish-ball vending is more profitable, and so she considered it as their primary business.\r\n\r\nNow, Marita has applied for a loan of 30,000 pesos as additional capital for her business, to improve her cart and some will go to her secondary business of doormat making.\r\n\r\nMarita is positive and hopeful that, if coupled with industry, their business will bring them great profit so that they can save and be able to send their children to school, enabling them to find jobs.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":359530,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food
