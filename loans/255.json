Represented by their leader Anta F., the group describes their enterprise as follows: <p>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe village of Elinkine is located in the south of Senegal 55 km from the regional capital of Oussouye, the capital of the department.  Elinkine is today one of the most popular villages in the region, or even the country, on account of its geographic position which makes it a very important and strategic crossroads in various sectors, of which fishing is the most famous.  This is especially true since 1997, when the fishermen of Diogu\u00e9 resettled in Elinkine.  <p>\r\n\r\nThe principal objective of the members of the Saxal Diam group is to improve their living conditions and contribute to the development of the village of Elinkine and its environs by producing and selling dried seafood.  The commercial activities of the group are focused on small-scale trade; this consists of buying and reselling various beauty products as well as dried fish in our village and in the rest of the country, especially the dried fish which is in high demand throughout the country and in the countries bordering Senegal [i.e. Gambia and Guinea-Bissau].  The members of our group will need a loan equivalent to 600,000 francs CFA [about $1175] for the purchase of fresh fish, salt, and knives needed to make the dried fish.  The working capital needed for the sale of beauty products will also be taken from this amount.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nOriginal French: <p>\r\n\r\n\u00ab Contexte du Projet: le village de Elinkine est situer au Sud du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal \u00e0 55 Km de la capitale r\u00e9gionale et \u00e0 18Km de Oussouye, capitale d\u00e9partemental.\r\nElinkine est aujourd\u2019hui l\u2019un des villages les plus sollicit\u00e9s de la r\u00e9gion voir du pays a cause de sa position g\u00e9ographique qui lui conf\u00e8re de carrefour tr\u00e8s important et strat\u00e9gique dans diff\u00e9rents secteurs dont la p\u00eache qui est le plus connu et ceci depuis les ann\u00e9es 97 avec le d\u00e9placement du village des p\u00eacheur de Diogu\u00e9 \u00e0 Elinkine. <p>\r\nObjectifs du Pr\u00eat : l\u2019objectif principal des membres du groupement Saxal Diam est : de part la transformation des produits halieutique et de leur vente parvenir \u00e0 am\u00e9lior\u00e9 les conditions de vie de leur membre et de contribuer au d\u00e9veloppement du village d\u2019Elinkine et de son entourage. <p>\r\nActivit\u00e9s : Les activit\u00e9s du groupement sont entre autre le petit commerce : il s\u2019agi d\u2019achat et de ventes de produit divers de beaut\u00e9, de poisson s\u00e9ch\u00e9 dans le village et dans le pays  ;en ce qui concerne le poisson sec qui est demand\u00e9 partout dans le pays et dans les pays limitrophe\r\nLes membres du groupement auront besoin comme fond de roulement un montant \u00e9gal \u00e0 600 000F CFA pour l\u2019achat des poissons frais, du sel, des couteaux, des coupe-coupe, pour la transformation.\r\nElles auront aussi pour besoin pour la vente des produits de beaut\u00e9 d\u2019un fond de roulement qui sera tir\u00e9 du m\u00eame montant. \u00bb <p>\r\n\r\nBackground<p>\r\n\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":6875,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of cosmetic products and  fish-processing equipment; transportation of goods to market","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Elinkine","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.516667 -16.7","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2006-12-09T18:02:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-12-25T01:44:06Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1175,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":117.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":106,"local_amount":106,"processed_date":"2007-03-23T04:46:07Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":11580},{"amount":106,"local_amount":106,"processed_date":"2007-04-21T21:01:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13447},{"amount":106,"local_amount":106,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T21:00:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16984},{"amount":106,"local_amount":106,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T21:06:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16999},{"amount":109,"local_amount":109,"processed_date":"2007-07-22T20:35:31Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":109,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34421},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T04:03:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41453},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T17:04:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50193},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:31:05Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63326},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:34:27Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80030},{"amount":107,"local_amount":107,"processed_date":"2007-12-08T21:35:44Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":93770},{"amount":213,"local_amount":213,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":213,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106871}],"funded_date":"2006-12-11T01:44:06Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T04:39:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":6577,"name":"Sophia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sophia is 42 and mother of 3 children.

He is a market vendor from Dushanbe where he sells teenagers' clothing. Umedjon is very enterprising, has vast experience working as a vendor, and is full of creative ideas. A reasonable pricing policy and client-friendly service have always been priorities in his work and have helped to ensure the success of his business. Umedjon has been running his business for many years. In general he has about 6 years of experience selling clothing. Currently, he is requesting a loan of $900 USD to increase his inventory. He promises to repay the loan within 12 months. He believes that having this additional turnover capital will help him minimize his sales risk and provide stable financial support for his family. Moreover, it will help him get closer to his ultimate goal of purchasing a big store of his own. \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

flatbreads for sale. Every loan that Mahsud had with us he has used to improve his business (purchase of coal, a few tonnes of flour etc.). He is planning to use this loan to purchase a small batch of highest quality flour. Mahsud's flatbreads are very popular due to their excellent quality and appetizing looks. Every time we visit Mahsud we are convinced that his business yields a steady income and is very reliable.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anya Lyuksyutova, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":329544,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of raw materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2009-06-09T15:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mahsud","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-06T10:56:00Z","rounded_local_amount":300.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63215975},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-10T10:21:22Z","rounded_local_amount":300.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73645451},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-14T09:12:42Z","rounded_local_amount":300.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87085065},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-04T09:26:33Z","rounded_local_amount":300.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97001299}],"funded_date":"2009-06-09T18:44:42Z","paid_date":"2009-12-04T09:26:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":117193,"name":"\u0110\u1ed7 Th\u1ecb","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"B. \u0110\u1ed7 Th\u1ecb, 57, lives in the town of Ninh Giang.

He is 44 years old and lives with his common-law wife. He has 7 children between the ages of 2 months and 16 years, with different mothers. He doesn't support anyone else economically and is able to save 1000 meticals a month.\r\n\r\nWhen Alberto finished 10th grade he did a three-year teacher training course. When he finished, he went to a community 45 km from Namaacha, where he's been a school principal for more than 15 years, earning 7799 meticals a month. Since his salary is his family's only source of income, he's not able to meet all their needs and approached BIM (International Bank of Mozambique) requesting a loan to begin building a house, which he was unable to finish because of the high cost of materials.\r\n\r\nHe then approached another bank, ProCredito, requesting a loan to continue the work, which he paid back successfully. But because of the distance, he has now chosen to work with Hluvuku and has requested another loan in the amount of 15,000 meticals to buy construction materials and finish the work.\r\n\r\nThis is Alberto's first loan with Hluvuku and Kiva. He will use the money to finish his project, since he's eager to finish his possessions are scattered and neglected. He is confident that he will be able to pay back the loan with no difficulty and then request another to build a wall around his home.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Andrea Rosenberg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":380584,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase construction materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Namaacha","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.970278 32.025556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":26.19,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":681.29},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":709.29},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":738.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":768.79},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":800.38},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":833.27},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":867.52},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":903.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":940.28},{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":978.93},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1019.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1061.04},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1104.64},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1150.04},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1197.3},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1246.46}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.19},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.3},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.47},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.68},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.95},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.62},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.52},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.07},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.08},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.9},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.78}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":26.12,"local_amount":681.29,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T19:53:45Z","rounded_local_amount":690.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87056861},{"amount":56.43,"local_amount":1472.19,"processed_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T23:30:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1491.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96971817},{"amount":74.81,"local_amount":1951.54,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T14:24:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1977.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110708936},{"amount":36.85,"local_amount":962.71,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:27:25Z","rounded_local_amount":975.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.05,"payment_id":123937963},{"amount":87.95,"local_amount":2297.27,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-24T07:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":2327.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.11,"payment_id":123937964},{"amount":40.98,"local_amount":1186.18,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:14:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1201.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.49,"payment_id":128971950},{"amount":225.67,"local_amount":6448.82,"processed_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-18T07:43:05Z","rounded_local_amount":6534.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":21.54,"payment_id":151915969}],"funded_date":"2009-09-05T00:07:36Z","paid_date":"2010-08-18T07:43:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Andrea Rosenberg","image":603074}},{"id":137724,"name":"Y\u00e8yinou B\u00e9atrice","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Z.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting & selling ocean-caught fish in the local community. Imelda has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 7,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Imelda joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Imelda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets. Imelda is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Imelda from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

He is in a common-law relationship with Ayd\u00e9, his unconditional partner.  They have two children, ages 7 and 2.  Alfredo and his family live in their own home in the District of Palcamayo.  Every morning, he wakes up to the crow of the rooster.  He knows that farm work requires great sacrifice and dedication.  Alfredo grows healthy products on his land such as potatoes, <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ulluco\" target=\"_blank\" >ulluco<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Oca\" target=\"_blank\" >oca<\/a>.  He has some of the best land in the area.  For this reason, he is able to make instantaneous sales at the wholesale market in Tarma.\r\n<p>\r\nAlfredo currently planted approximately 25 sacks of potatoes of various colors (including white).  He will sell each sack between 30 to 50 PEN, based on the variety.  The ulluco crop will be harvested next August.  At the same time, Alfredo buys and sells mutton for 10 PEN\/kilo.  He earns around 50 PEN for each head of sheep.  Alfredo explains, \u201cI only sell meat when necessary.  If I have any debts, I will butcher a sheep whenever the farming does not do well.\u201d  Farming is a passion for Alfredo, so his goals are related to his activity.  He wants to extend his plantings and increase his production with each passing year.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be his 15th loan with MFP.  Alfredo gives his word that he will be exact and precise with his loan payments.  Regarding his Communal Bank, he says that he is very pleased with the work they do together.  Alfredo says that he will invest all of the money in the purchase of sacks of compost that cost 120 PEN\/each.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":930828,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy sacks of compost.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-02T15:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alfredo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455348}],"funded_date":"2011-12-02T21:30:23Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":368030,"name":"Amer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amer is a 19-year-old man, a freshman in one of the private colleges in Jordan.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Por las ma\u00f1anas iba a su colegio, y por las tardes se dedica a la siembra, esa era su rutina diaria. Su madre estaba delicada de salud y su padre comercializaba sus productos de cacao, pero dentro de sus posibilidades le dieron a Constantina las comodidades b\u00e1sicas que necesitaba. Es por ello que Constantina se esforz\u00f3 duro y parejo para sacar adelante la producci\u00f3n de cacao que sus padres le dejaron, ahora junto a su esposo labraron la tierra, para darle mayor impulso a su producci\u00f3n y con el tiempo rindi\u00f3 sus primeros frutos y de buena calidad. Posteriormente su producto es vendido en los centros de acopio,  d\u00e1ndole buenos resultados econ\u00f3micos; no contentos con ello decidieron instalar una peque\u00f1a bodega con la finalidad de ampliar su econom\u00eda, por lo que ya van tres a\u00f1os de muchas satisfacciones personales y emocionales.

She lives in the beautiful Cusco backcountry in the Palestina Alta community where they own their own home.  \r\n\r\nConstantina relates that her life has been difficult; as an adolescent she helped her parents with their farming chores.  In the morning she would attend school and in the afternoons she cared for the crops; this was her daily routine.\r\n\r\nHer mother was in poor health and her father was a cocoa bean merchant and they were able to provide Constantina with what comforts were within their meager means.  Because of this, Constantina has worked hard and fast to succeed with the cocoa bean production her parents left her.  Now, together with her husband, she works the land to produce higher yields and, in time, has had the first high quality fruits of her labor.\r\n\r\nOnce harvested, the product is sold to area consolidating centers yielding good profits.  Not satisfied with this, however, they decided to establish a small store with the goal in mind to improve their finances.  They have gotten much emotional and personal satisfaction from this for three years now.  \r\n\r\nConstantina would like to expand her store by introducing more merchandise into her inventory.  This is her 4th loan with MFP and she assures us that she will repay in a timely fashion.\r\n\r\nShe will use the funds to buy certain quantities of merchandise to stock her store in order to acquire

Feliciano and his family live in the community of Pico Central, 68 kilometers from the city of Cochabamba, so it's difficult to go to the bank for a loan. The family makes a living in agriculture, producing potatoes, broad beans and other items on their plot of land. Feliciano's wife helps out and takes care of the livestock and the children. Feliciano is requesting the loan to purchase organic fertilizer to plant with his his potatoes, which he believes will increase his potato production by two hectares because he has some uncultivated land. This will help him save money for when his children complete their primary education, since there are only primary schools in the area where they live and all the children only have that level of education due to a lack of resources.

poder estar realizando otras actividades, lo que no le gusta es que a veces las personas se demoran en pagar, pero siempre tiene clientes y lo bueno es que como ya tiene a\u00f1os en el negocio sabe a quien dar y a quien no, a Cherli le gustar\u00eda mas adelante poder poner una tienda da plater\u00eda y oro en la ciudad.Este es el cuarto pr\u00e9stamo entre Cherli y la instituci\u00f3n MFP, esta

1500 soles, ella comprara mas joyas, para as\u00ed poder seguir realizando su trabajo y poder generar mas ganancias e ingresos a su hogar.\n\n","en":"\r\nCherli, 37, is a very active woman; she\u2019s always looking for something to do to generate income for her three children\u2019s education.  She lives with her spouse and children in her mother\u2019s house.  \r\n\r\nCherli\u2019s work consists in buying and selling silver and gold jewelry.  She\u2019s also a clothing merchant.  She sends money to the city of Lima and the products she orders are sent to her from there and then she sells them among her friends and neighbors in the city.  She\u2019s been in this business on average nine years.  She works alone and has quite a good customer base.  What she enjoys the most about it is that it leaves her with time to do other things.  What she dislikes about it is that sometimes people take their time to repay her but she always has customers and since she\u2019s been in business for a long time she knows who she can give credit to and who she can\u2019t.  Later on, Cherli would like to be able to open a silver and gold shop in the city.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan between Cherli and MFP.  She is very happy to work with us and hopes to continue to do so.  Besides, she feels very comfortable with her group because they are always concerned about each other.  She will use the requested 1500 soles to buy more jewelry to continue doing her work and generating more profits and income for her home.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":858060,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to get more jewelry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-08-30T03:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Cherli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":224.97},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":234.27},{"due_date":"2011-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":245.37},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":255.19},{"due_date":"2011-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":264.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":275.54}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.49},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.9},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.97},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.57},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.04},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":101.03}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":168.39,"local_amount":459.24,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:16Z","rounded_local_amount":459.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851246},{"amount":89.97,"local_amount":245.37,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:29Z","rounded_local_amount":245.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666425},{"amount":93.57,"local_amount":255.19,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:15Z","rounded_local_amount":255.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621580},{"amount":97.04,"local_amount":264.66,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:44Z","rounded_local_amount":265.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835655},{"amount":101.03,"local_amount":275.54,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:30Z","rounded_local_amount":275.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245435}],"funded_date":"2011-09-02T18:14:35Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":335244,"name":"Cristo Del Consuelo (Cuenca) Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El banco comunal Cristo del Consuelo est\u00e1 conformado por 8 mujeres quienes son personas luchadoras, trabajadoras y muy alegres a pesar de las dificultades de la vida.

His carpentry business is done from this house, which is equipped with all the necessary tools to build furniture.\r\nHe proudly states that his profession provided his three daughters the opportunity to get an education.

Matilde J.

Both daughters are currently in high school and help their mother when they are not studying. Matilde is thankful for the help of her daughters, as maintaining her business and family has been difficult since the death of her husband in 2001. Mr. Olmedo died of cancer at the age of 45. This was a tremendous loss for the family and also left Matilde with the debt incurred due to the operations and treatment her husband undertook to try and cure him. For this reason Matilde works extremely hard to cover the debt she has as a result of her husband\u2019s death.<p>Her store, a small grocery, is very well-stocked and well-managed due to the time and effort Matilde dedicates to it. She sells rice, noodles, oil, sugar, flour and eggs. Having had this store for 14 years, she understands how to make things run smoothly. She has asked for a loan to buy articles of clothing. She wishes to expand her store to also sell clothing. It is her hope that with the summer months and added inventory she will be able to increase her sales.

She began her business with a small inventory, slowly increasing her turnover. After a while, Mavluda was able to save money and opened her own shop. In 2003, she rented a stall (in the picture). Currently, she has wide range of products: baked goods, which she purchases in the local bakeries and confectioners shops as well as soft drinks and juices from local manufacturers. The rest of her goods she purchases at local wholesale markets. Her inventory is worth $1000 and she is applying to KIVA with a request for a loan of $1200 (5000 Somoni) for 6 months for the purchase of her next batch of products. <p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from

She works at her business for 5-8 hours per day, seven days per week, and is assisted by two employees. Jessie currently earns about $100 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan to purchase ingredients for making food. In the future, she plans to open another business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She is 41 years old, married, and is the mother of five children with ages ranging from 12 to 23 years.  Only the three youngest go to school.\r\n\r\nShe has no dependents, and relies on the help of her second son in her work.  She manages to save 1,000 MT per month because they run their business in a rented chicken coop that costs 1,000 MT for each phase.\r\n\r\nRabeca left Gaza when she was only two years old for the town of Namaacha (at the border of Swaziland) with her mother, who went there looking for work.  She began her schooling very late due to their financial situation.  When she was in fourth grade, her mother lost her job and she had to abandon her studies and work in a state-owned company as a chicken keeper for five years to help with household expenses.\r\n\r\nYears later, she married her husband, who gave her funds to begin her own business raising and selling chickens.  This involves an average of 2x100 chicks in each stage, which she has sold both wholesale and retail so as not to lose her clientele.  Spending 14,000 MT in each phase, she earns 4,000 MT in profit when she sells wholesale to dealers, and 6,000 MT in profit when she sells chickens singly to local consumers.  But later, due to enormous orders for her product, she approached Hluvuku and Kiva, asking for a loan in the amount of 10,000 MT to increase her livestock (to buy more chicks and feed) and to satisfy the needs of her customers on time.\r\n\r\nThis is Rabeca's third loan with Hluvuku and her first loan with Kiva.  The first loan of 9,200 MT and the second of 7,000 MT were used for the same purpose.  She is confident that she will repay the loan before it comes due and will ask for new loans to build her own chicken coop.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Heidi Petersen, Kiva

She lives in her own home with her husband Antonio, 59, her life-long companion, and what they want the most is a tranquil old age.  The farmlands they have cultivated with so much hard work have provided the income necessary to maintain their family.  She grows carrots, potatoes, and gladiolas (flowers), which then, with her husband's help, she takes to sell in the main market of the city of Tarma, which is where she can get the best prices for her produce.  What she enjoys the most about her work is planting seeds in the land, which she does with great patience.  She has been doing this for 29 years, and the hardest part is guarding her crops from the pests that can afflict them.  In the future she hopes to increase her lands so she can grow more.  This is the eighth loan Julia has had through MFP, she has repaid her previous loans very punctually and intends to do so this time.  As a member of her communal bank, she is very committed to the development of her group.  With the $550 she is requesting, she will purchase additional pea seeds as well as fertilizer and insecticides.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Susan Sanford, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":503636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of seed, fertilizer, insecticide","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-10T19:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1556.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886863}],"funded_date":"2010-03-11T01:29:41Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Geoffrey and Susan Gall","image":107956}},{"id":187731,"name":"Dong's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u1ecb Ho\u00e0ng was born in 1959.

They live together in a densely populated neighbourhood in the north of the city, and have a great desire to get ahead. Every day is a constant fight to get ahead in life for this hard-working man. For 2 years, he has offered a taxi service. He says that he likes this work very much, and the time he has spent in this work has allowed him to acquire loyal customers who call him when they need to go somewhere. This has allowed him to have a steady income. He works in the streets of the city in the daytime, but he does not like the night schedule much, since it is dangerous. Since the car is his own, he has no problems setting his schedule and his route. Along with this job, he also has a store in a large commercial centre where he sells cds. He is helped by an employee who tends to the business, and it generates him regular income. This is how his days go by, always looking out for his family's well-being. He is always thinking of the future. He plans to expand his cd store and acquite his own location, since his current location is rented. This is his first loan with MFP, and he promises to repay his quotas punctually, since he does not want to lose face with the people who have provided the loan that will allow him to continue working in the search of progress. Teofilo plans to invest the requested loan in the purchase of cds to better stock his business.

A. is a cattle farmer, 34 years old, and together with his wife and their three children he lives in the community of Las Minas, Dulce Nombre de Culmi in Olancho. Felipe has been a cattle farmer since he was a boy, having learned the trade from his father. Felipe raises milking cows and he has his own establishment from where he makes his sales, he also makes other products such as cheese and butter. One of the difficulties he faces is the rainy season when the milk production in the region increases and the price of the products drops for the abundance and this decreases his earnings.

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. \n\nThe amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

Her family consists of her husband, Denis, and their 3 children, whom they adore.  They live in their own house in the Uni\u00f3n Palomar community (central Peruvian jungle).  Since she\u2019s been married she has done several types of jobs.  A little while ago she  closed the carpentry business because of money problems.  But with family effort, she is sure that soon it will reopen.  Now she sells  coffee plants that she grows in the greenhouses to transplant in the coffee fields.   She is able to sell, on her best days, 1000 coffee seedlings.  Her husband, Denis, has also farmed with her for the past 8 years.  Their main crops are coffee, bananas, and avodados, selling  the coffee beans in Villa Rica.  As she tells us, this year she had the best income from the coffee bean sales because the increase in price in the market is very good.  That\u2019s why she is working hard to take advantage of the increase.  She belongs to the communal bank \u201cPrestatarios de Uni\u00f3n Palomar  and this is her second loan with MFP.  She is sure that she will get ahead with hard work and the financial support of all of you.  She also promises to be punctual with her payments.

From those sessions, he knows how to raise cow so that it grows fast. He found it very interesting and decided to raise Kereman cow (cow which is raised in the barn). For the initial capital, he borrowed money from Dinari. He bought 2 male cows that cost Rp. 2,500,000 (about $276). The rest of the loan was used to built the barn for the cow and to purchase cow food for 4 months. He feeds the cow twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. In the afternoon, he feeds the cows with grass and leaves as supplements. He bought food concentrate from the merchants in his village. The food concentrate cost Rp. 1,500 (about $0.16) per kg. The Kereman cow is given 1 kg food concentrate with sugar cane liquid, salt, and some water. After 4 months passes, the cow with 400 kg of weight can be sold for Rp. 16,500 (about $1.8) per kg. With this business, Yudi Cahyana hopes to improve his quality of life.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Kustini Lim, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nYudi  Cahyana rajin mengikuti penyuluhan-penyuluhan yang diadakan di desanya.

Yudi Cahyana tertarik dan memutuskan untuk pelihara sapi Kereman ( sapi yang dikandangkan ). Untuk modal, Yudi Cahyana meminjam dari Dinari sebagai modal awal untuk mencoba menerapkan ilmu yang diperolehnya. Yudi Cahyana membeli 2 sapi pejantan yang sudah cukup besar dengan harga Rp. 2.500.000,- Sisa modalnya dipergunakan untuk membuat  kandang sapi dan  untuk modal pakan selama 4 bulan. Setiap hari Yudi Cahyana memberi makan 2 kali setiap pagi dan sore. Untuk siang hari diberi hijauan sebagai makanan tambahan. Yudi Cahyana membeli konsentrat di pedagang yang ada didesanya. Per kg harganya Rp.1500,-. Sapi kereman diberi makan 1 kg konsentrat dicampur tetes tebu ( cairan dari pembuatan gula ) dan garam, lalu diisi air secukupnya. Setelah 4 bulan sapi bisa dijual dengan berat sapinya mencapai 400 kg dengan harga per kilo Rp.16.500,-.

A small part wil be used to fix some parts of her house.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Barbara (B) Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":291433,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy ingredients to make her regional foods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T22:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":173.23},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":189.95},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":194.37},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":205.68},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":213.6},{"due_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":223.17}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.74},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.32},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.79},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.2},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.39}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.74,"local_amount":173.23,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:44:25Z","rounded_local_amount":181.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012287},{"amount":63.32,"local_amount":189.95,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:51Z","rounded_local_amount":199.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595869},{"amount":64.79,"local_amount":194.37,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:14Z","rounded_local_amount":203.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990136},{"amount":68.56,"local_amount":205.68,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:40:41Z","rounded_local_amount":215.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211262},{"amount":71.2,"local_amount":213.6,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":223.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640772},{"amount":74.39,"local_amount":223.17,"processed_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:10Z","rounded_local_amount":233.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080234}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T00:47:17Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:33:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"B Brown","image":120650}},{"id":100857,"name":"Dorcas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dorcas B. is 43 years old.

T. is a 63-year-old woman living in the town of Vaimea.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing general  alteration & tailoring services to local community members.  Isa has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 650 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIsa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Isa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1750 WST from SPBD.  This previous loan was used to purchase additional tailoring equipment such as needles & threads.  Isa is now requesting a new loan of 2000 WST which will be used to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  The loan will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from SPBD.  Isa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to financially support immediate members of the borrower's family.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For the past 4 years he has been selling potatoes to the big restaurants and the chicken rotisserie restaurants of Lima.  He works in the city of Lima buying sacks of potatoes, washes them, and peels and cuts them up with modern machinery and then they are distributed to his customers.  His partner works with him in this company and he feels that finally he can give his family an adequate quality of life, despite the fact that they have to sacrifice with the daily work by being careful with the managine. Besides, he has farmland where he grows beans, and thus gets additional earnings.

After the rainy season, the crops are stocked for a certain period of time in order for them to gain value before being sold at the large market in Kimparana and the surrounding markets, on a retail basis (but often wholesale too), for cash to a customer base coming generally from large towns. \r\n\r\nThe group members are expecting to make a profit of 15,000 to 65,000FCFA each once their produce has been sold; this will be used to repay interest on their loans and cover household running costs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":790737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy agricultural inputs, seeds and small equipment","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Djalakoro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tenima ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Boucar ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ada ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kounadi Issa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kounadi Almoudou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":510000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":510000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1125,"local_amount":510000,"processed_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:08Z","rounded_local_amount":514333.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283065}],"funded_date":"2011-07-07T07:25:04Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:48:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":310676,"name":"John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"John is 22 years old and a hard-working businessman.

Ella compra ollas, platos y cucharas por mayor y las vende como ambulante.  Dice que siempre trata de tener una selecci\u00f3n surtida de sus productos.

Aunque la ausencia de su pareja le causo mucho sufrimiento ella nunca cay\u00f3 en deuda. Lo que mas le gusta a Mar\u00eda de las reuniones de su Bancomunal son los valores de la puntualidad y la responsabilidad que le han inculcado y las amistades que ha creado con las socias. Su hijo mayor esta en Huancayo sacando su titulo para ser profesor y Mar\u00eda esta ahorrando para pagar lo ultimo que le queda de estudio. En FINCA Per\u00fa ella ahorra para sus hijos y dice que gracias a ese apoyo nunca le hace falta comida en su hogar o para los pasajes de sus hijos.

She is 40 years old and lives with four of her five children.  Three years ago Mar\u00eda's husband died and she had to face the challenge of raising her children completely on her own.  She is requesting this loan for her business selling kitchenware.  She buys pans, plates and spoons wholesale and then sells them as an itinerant vendor.  She says that she always tries to have a selection of products in stock.  \r\n\r\nMar\u00eda has been working with FINCA Peru for more than 15 years.  When her husband died she took a year out and then returned when she was able to overcome her loneliness.  Although the absence of her partner caused her a lot of suffering, she never fell into debt.  What Mar\u00eda most enjoys about her community bank meetings are the values of punctuality and responsibility that are instilled into everybody and the friendships that she has with her fellow group members.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's eldest son is in Huancayo, finishing his degree so that he can become a teacher.  Mar\u00eda is saving up so that she can cover the last remaining payments for his studies.  Through FINCA Peru, Mar\u00eda saves for her children and says that, thanks to this support, she is always able to provide food for her household and cover her children's transport costs.  Mar\u00eda always bears in mind that the most important thing is to always work with happiness and love and that, with this outlook, everything turns out

She learned all about agriculture as a child and she's been caring for animals ever since.  \r\n\r\nHer mother and son step right in for her while she's at work, but in the afternoons she is the one taking care of the animals, mainly sheep.  She gets up early every day so she doesn't neglect her chores.  Each month she goes to the livestock fair in her area to sell the sheep she has raised and buy new young ones.\r\n\r\nEddy won't rest until she has achieved her goal of having a big stable where she can keep more sheep, which she can sell to raise more capital.  This is her first time seeking a loan from MFP and she is very excited about starting to work in solidarity with her group; she promises to be one of the most active members of her village bank.  She plans to use her loan to buy more sheep, which cost about 150 soles each.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":291465,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy young sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-22T23:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eddy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":170.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012299},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:02:08Z","rounded_local_amount":170.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595881},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:02Z","rounded_local_amount":170.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990148},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:33Z","rounded_local_amount":170.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211274},{"amount":54.32,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:55Z","rounded_local_amount":170.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640784},{"amount":53.6,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:31:28Z","rounded_local_amount":168.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080246}],"funded_date":"2009-03-22T23:21:53Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:31:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":100873,"name":"Marie","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Marie T. a 45 ans, mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 04 enfants.

Uganda, is single and has two children, both in school.  Elizabeth has a beauty salon that she has operated for nine years.         <p>\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Elizabeth has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda to purchase more dryers.  With the help of the loan, she hopes to generate greater profits and pay school fees.  In the future, Elizabeth hopes to own a training school for catering, tailoring and hair dressing. Elizabeth is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future.<p>\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":587271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

He has four children between the ages of 5 and 12; the 3 eldest go to school.  Ernesto only finished sixth grade and did not continue because of his parents' financial troubles.  He and his family live in his own house, which his parents gave to him, and he supports his parents, who live with him.\r\n\r\nHe left his hometown to come to Boane with his parents.  Ernesto has been a stonemason for more than 15 years and works with three helpers.  He earns about 3,500 meticais per month after paying his helpers, and he manages to save some money at home for unforeseen circumstances.\r\n\r\nHe has never had loans with other banks.  Ernesto learned about Hluvuku through neighbors who are also customers of this institution.  This is his second loan.  He is asking for 10,000 meticais, and he intends to buy construction material (iron, cement, doors, beams, and other items) to continue building his home.

Delie is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP, which also will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the fourth loan taken out by Delie from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \n\nAbout ASKI:\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

living by buying and selling rice. She has a child who is 26 years old.\r\n\r\nShe joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she wanted a better life for family. With the help of 17 previous loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Emma has been slowly lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 19,500 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped increase her monthly profits to PHP 10,000, and that meant a higher living standard for her family. She is applying for her 18th loan, for PHP 19,500, to buy more rice to sell because this will allow her to save more money and create a prosperous future for herself and her daughter. Emma is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path to the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through its poverty-alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

They live in traditional families and are on average 31 years old with at least four children.\r\n\r\nThey mainly grow peanuts. To make their farming profitable, members of the Noupagagnon 1 group decided two years ago to join the Soro Yiriwaso credit program. Having successfully repaid the previous loan, they are now on their second agricultural loan.\r\n\r\nPortio, who is the president and is the first person standing on the right with a green scarf, wants to buy peanuts for planting, small farming equipment and agricultural inputs at the general market in Kimparana.\r\n\r\nAfter the rainy season, crops are stored for a while so that they can gain value before being resold at the general market in Kimparana and in surrounding markets, mainly retail for cash to customers usually from large cities.\r\n\r\nAfter selling their agricultural products each member of the group hopes to achieve profits between 21,000 and 23,000 FCFA, which will be used to repay loan interests and cover ongoing family expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":790752,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural

She also wants to have it well stocked, with a greater variety of articles, to have more and better profits.\r\n\r\nShe says she knows her friends very well, and they are very responsible, hard-working, and trustworthy people who want to get ahead and improve themselves, for which they are working very hard.\r\n\r\nShe thanks FRAC and the Kiva lenders for giving her the opportunity and self-confidence, but above all for believing in her, since thanks to their help she managed to invest in her business and so have a better quality of life, along with her family, and a better future.\r\n\r\nThe members of the El Zapotito group are Blanca, Isabel, Arcenia, and Emilia, who make and sell handmade clothing.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":886176,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy more materials such as fabric, needlework fabric, thread, needles, frames, and embroidery beads.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-10-08T01:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Arcenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1970.99},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2099.05},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2210.01},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2304.92},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2415.03}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":143.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.73},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":167.63},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175.64}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":143.34,"local_amount":1970.99,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:23:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1976.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618972},{"amount":152.66,"local_amount":2099.05,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:04:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2104.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244573217},{"amount":160.73,"local_amount":2210.01,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:13:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2215.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250784929},{"amount":172.23,"local_amount":2368.13,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:27:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2374.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193495},{"amount":171.04,"local_amount":2351.82,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2358.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263329887}],"funded_date":"2011-10-10T04:14:51Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:41:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catharine Wall","image":1532414}},{"id":347600,"name":"Jose Francisco","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or Jos\u00e9 Francisco tiene 31 a\u00f1os es padre soltero, adem\u00e1s se dedica una desgranadora de ma\u00edz, hace ocho a\u00f1os.

Baktybek was born in 1980 to a simple farming family. From childhood Baktybek, the older brother of two sisters, helped his father care for the animals and dreamed of having his own farm in the future. After high school, Baktybek studied at an automotive technical college to be an agricultural equipment driver, and then settled down at a local farm as a tractor-combine operator. A year later, Baktybek's father died of an illness. This was a difficult time for him, as he became the only man and provider for the family; his mother did not work anywhere and his sisters were still young. Having worked on the farm for several years, Baktybek decided to go abroad for work. For a few years, he worked in Almaty (Kazahstan) and in Moscow (Russia) as a security guard, driver, construction worker and other jobs that did not require an education. Baktybek sent his earnings home and his mother bought cattle and got her daughters married. In 2010, Baktybek decided to get married. In this year something unfortunate happened- his mother died. His wife helped him survive this loss, who became his support in everything. Baktybek resolutely decided to raise livestock and at this time, thanks to his perseverance, Baktybek  has 2 dairy cows, two bulls and 30 heads of sheep. His monthly income from selling milk and dairy products is around 10,000 som. In order to further increase this amount, Baktybek has turned to Bai Tushum and Partners to request a loan of 100,000 som to buy dairy cows. Later Batybek plans to increase his amount of livestock and dreams of building a big home.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2175,"image":{"id":922149,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

Thanks to her very hard work, she currently owns two cows, two horses, two calves and 20 head of sheep.  She makes a monthly income of about 4,000 som (KGS) from her business.  In order to further grow her farming business, she has turned to Bai Tushum Bank CJSC for a loan of 120,000 som (KGS) which will be used to buy sheep and calves and increase her cattle headcount.

It is the family business that brings in the general income. She is engaged in the home of livestock raising and selling and milk production. In time, she dreams of purchasing a horn pedigree milk-cow for the milk-sour (cultured milk) products and selling. Now Mrs. Ruzimatova F. requests a loan for business development to increase significantly the family income and to purchase another milk-cow."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":114737,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"For business development","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":47,"posted_date":"2008-01-18T23:45:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruzimatova","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-02-02T01:18:28Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63,"local_amount":214.2,"processed_date":"2008-02-20T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":218.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138954},{"amount":63,"local_amount":214.2,"processed_date":"2008-03-20T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:08:32Z","rounded_local_amount":218.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":161994},{"amount":63,"local_amount":214.2,"processed_date":"2008-04-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:12:43Z","rounded_local_amount":218.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":187145},{"amount":63,"local_amount":214.2,"processed_date":"2008-05-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:14:38Z","rounded_local_amount":218.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":215080},{"amount":63,"local_amount":214.2,"processed_date":"2008-06-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:18:55Z","rounded_local_amount":218.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":243860},{"amount":63,"local_amount":214.2,"processed_date":"2008-07-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:22:46Z","rounded_local_amount":218.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":272255},{"amount":63,"local_amount":214.2,"processed_date":"2008-08-20T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:46:38Z","rounded_local_amount":218.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301527},{"amount":59,"local_amount":200.6,"processed_date":"2008-09-20T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-26T07:26:08Z","rounded_local_amount":204.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332269}],"funded_date":"2008-01-19T01:18:28Z","paid_date":"2008-09-26T07:26:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":35330,"name":"Kireka A2(Iii) Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The leader of this small group is Annet M..
