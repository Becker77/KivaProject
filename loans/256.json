It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<P>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 35 years old, single and has one school-aged child. Amormia is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Amormia A.\u2019s Group.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Amormia owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. She has been engaged in this business for two years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month. \r\n\r\nIn 2010, she joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. Amormia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products for her retail store. This will be the third loan taken out by Amormia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living condition of her family.\r\n\r\n About PMPC: Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\nAbout Group Loans\r\n\r\nIn a group loan, each member of the group receives an individual loan but is part of a group of individuals bound by a group guarantee. Under this arrangement, each member of the group supports one another and is responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or default.

She is 36 years old. Florida is the group leader of a 4-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. \r\n\r\nFlorida is married and has three school-aged children. Florida owns and operates a livestock business. The main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Florida has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month from it. \r\n\r\nIn 2008, Florida joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to do business. Florida has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. Florida is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase hog feed and other supplies. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Florida from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand it. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisher-folk and small entrepreneurs. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Traditional textile weaving business, which is a heritage from her mother is the choice, because by doing it, she is still able to do all housewife activities and raise her two children. Ni Luh Yoga Semadi has been working on traditional textile weaving quite long, even since before she got married, but she still could not able to earn maximum income. She start from weaved a piece of cloth, and continue to do more and more. She usually sells her weaving products to nearest stores and sometimes she works on orders from customers. She purchases yearn and printing materials from Nagari market. Ni Luh Yoga Semadi receives more orders on Galungan and Kuningan halidays that sometimes she could not be able to fulfill other orders. The limited capital only enables her to fulfill her family daily needs, which is Rp 15,000 a day. Fortunately they live in their own house that they do not have to pay rental fee. Now Ni Luh Yoga Semadi is very thankful for she could earn loan from Dinari Foundation to increase her capital that enable her to produce more waeving products according to orders she received from stores and others. She wish the income she earns will be more that she hopes she will be able to give as highest education for her children, and to fulfill their daily needs.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Indonesian by Hestyana, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nSebagai istri dari suami yang berprofesi sebagai Pegawai rendahan , Ni Luh Yoga Semadi dituntut untuk mampu membantu suami dalam hal menambah pendapatan keluarga. Usaha Tenun kain tradisional merupakan pilihan hidup yang dijalani dan juga merupakan usaha turun temurun yang diwariskan oleh ibu kandungnya, karena dengan usaha itu ia masih dapat mengerjakan semua aktifitas sebagai ibu rumah tangga sekaligus mengasuh kedua orang anaknya. Usaha tenun kain sudah lama dia tekuni,  bahkan sebelum Ni Luh Yoga Semadi menikah sudah bisa mengerjakan usaha ini akan tetapi belum mampu memperoleh hasil yang maksimal.\r\nBerawal dari mengerjakan satu lembar kain hingga menjadi banyak. Hasil tenun kainnya biasanya disetor ketoko-toko atau membuat sesuai pesanan masyarat lainnya.Sedangkan  bahan seperti benang dan sablonan lainnya dibeli dari pasar Negara. Biasanya pesanan akan ramai menjelang hari raya Galungan dan Kuningan . Sehingga Ni Luh Yoga Semadi menjadi kekurangan modal dan tidak bisa melayani pesanan sesuai dengan keinginan masyarakat. Sehingga keuntungan yang diperoleh hanya cukup untuk memenuhi kebutuhan sehari \u2013hari,karena setiap hari Ni Luh Yoga Semadi harus mengeluarkan biaya sebesar Rp.15.000, untungnya rumah yang ditempati merupakan milik pribadi sehingga tidak perlu mengeluarkan biaya untuk sewa rumah.Tetapi sekarang Ni Luh Yoga Semadi sangat bersyukur karena telah mendapat pinjaman dana dari yayasan Dinari untuk menambah modal usahanya. Sehingga  Ni Luh Yoga Semadi bisa membuat tenunan kain lebih banyak dan sesuai dengan pesanan dari toko-toko maupun masyarakat langsung dengan berbagai macam warna dan corak,dengan harapan keuntungan yang didapat menjadi lebih banyak sehingga nantinya Ni Luh Yoga Semadi dapat menyekolahkan kedua anaknya ketingkat yang lebih tinggi, dan dapat memenuhi kebutuhan

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For a long time he worked only as a physical education teacher until he was motivated to put a store in his house, which has improved over time.  Now he also makes bread with his mother to sell, while continuing to practice his profession as a teacher in a public school.  Each day he gets up very early to go out to buy the things that are needed for the store.  The store is open from 6:30 in the morning until 10:00 at night.  He made the decision to increase his working capital and this is the reason that he has applied for a loan with EMPRENDER.  He is very proud of the work that he is doing, since he is a single father and must give an example to his two small children who are in primary school.  He is very pleased to have the support that the institution provides, and is committed to succeed so as to be a good example for his family.  He would like to eventually be able to make his little shop into a store in order to be able to increase his earnings and give better opportunities to his

She plans to use this loan to invest in her hot-dog selling business by buying bread, sausage, cabbage, ketchup, mayonnaise and other items. She will use the profits to buy school supplies for her children and to build part of her house and she want to have a better business and go forward.\r\n\r\nThis Esperanza associate began with us because she likes the facilities Esperanza offers to its clients. Her story is representative of her group and of Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican clients, many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti, generally. Her group is located in Santiago, an area famous for tobacco and beef production that is the second biggest city in the Dominican Republic. This area, like nearly all impoverished areas of the Dominican Republic, suffers from unreliable running water (none of which is potable) and electricity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":578853,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She lives in Sitio Mahayahay, Brgy. Daan Lungsod, Medellin, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her fishing business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 13,500. Loreta is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can purchase fishing gear and equipment. This will be her 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nLoreta aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She sells clothing, footwear, undergarments, cosmetics and other products through the popular direct sales brands like Avon, Fullerlife, Natasha, Boardwalk, Marikina Shoe Exchange, and other direct sales brands. A customer's order is paid for in cash by the dealer and then given to the customer with a one-month-to-pay credit. Dealer\u2019s prices are lower than those in the catalogue, and these are the profits that dealers are counting on as their income. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php 2,000 in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 24,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to pay for merchandise to fill orders for her customers. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nAnalyn dreams of being able to give all her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also wants to have a rice retailing outlet to manage someday. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

Umarjon is 36 years old. He is married with four children. He has great passion for dairy farming and has been in this business for 15 years together with his wife. Umarjon would like to expand his business by adding more cattle to the ones he has. This is because recently he acquired orders from outside town to supply milk. \r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan of $2000 USD. With additional income Umarjon will be better able to cater for his family's financial obligations, especially the education of his children.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Misael began his electronics repair business 20 years ago with much sacrifice and the support of his father, who gave Misael a location in which he could operate his business.

","en":"Segundina is a 31-year-old mother of 4 and has lived with her partner for 17 years. She currently lives with one of her children and a granddaughter. Her house is located on the lands which she cultivates, about 7 kilometers from the city. Since she was very young she has worked cultivating ki\u00f3n (ginger), achote, and coffee. What she enjoys planting most is coffee, of which she has sown four hectares. Now, after 7 months, she is harvesting ki\u00f3n, which she has sold at 5 soles\/kilo. She and her husband enjoy this activity very much, as working on the farm is not difficult. What she enjoys most is planting coffee because she does not lose money - even when the market price is low during certain seasons, she just dries the coffee and saves it to sell later. The ki\u00f3n is different - she needs to sell it for whatever price is asked on the market at the moment. Segundina has future plans to buy land closer to the city so her children can study there and not have to walk hours to get to school. Despite the long distance she must travel, and that she has no responsibility within the group, she is the first to arrive at the community bank meetings. She is very happy with her group; this is her 3rd loan, and during this time she has shown she can make her payments responsibly. The money she has requested is to buy fertilizers and insecticides against mosquitoes, which impact her coffee farm.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She sells hair products and cosmetics in her business, which is called El Punto de La Belleza.  She is married and has two daughters, 16 and 18 years old.\r\n\r\nHer loan for 2,000,000 COP will be invested in working capital to buy hair products and cosmetics like creams, sunscreen, and shampoos.  She will also use the money to enhance her women\u2019s accessories like necklaces and bracelets that her family designs. \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n, and she wants her business to keep growing.  She wants it to become recognized as the place to go to get everything needed to create a good image.\r\n\r\nAs she wants to create her own brand of accessories that she designs, her main challenge is to strengthen this line and position it in the market.  \r\n\r\nShe learned to work with hair products when she was a commercial advisor in an important business.  With her effort and tenacity she started to work independently.  She started with a display case.  Then, when she had more experience, she moved to a place located very close to her house in the country neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe move allowed this small businesswoman to enjoy more time with her family.  She is now her own boss.  Above all, she goes with her daughters to practice their favorite sport, skating.  Through this activity she has gotten to know the mothers of their friends, and she has increased the number of customers she has.  The business is located close to the sporting places where they practice this discipline.\r\n\r\nShe has involved her family in her business.  She wants this to be a great business.  Therefore, when she heard her friends talking about the Fundaci\u00f3n, she thought of her dream of continuing to grow and expanding her range of products.\r\n\r\nKeeping in mind that her daughter started studying business administration, and that she also designs accessories like necklaces, earrings, and bracelets, she started selling them.  They have been widely accepted among her customers.  Nubia saw that her daughter had a talent for designing jewelry.  So, she is promoting her business spirit.  \r\n\r\nThat is why she hopes to be helped with a loan, to get ahead with her proposal.  She will use her dynamic nature to be able to meet the challenges of the market.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

She lives in Roadside, Barangay Bagonawa, San Enrique, Negros Occidental. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2003 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her food transport business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average income of PHP25,000. \r\n\r\nBenedicta is now borrowing PHP 26,000 so that she can buy materials for the renovation of the family house. This will be her 14th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP25,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Benedicta aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and to ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She has spent a number of years selling items in order to be able to pay basic bills for her household, since her husband is a construction worker and doesn't earn much. So she helps their children with what she can. With the loans she has made improvements to her home, and she is pleased with the investments.

She has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately $75 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Zenaida joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI.\r\n\r\nZenaida is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients for cooking. She also wants to purchase pigs and chickens to raise. This will be her 3rd loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is 33 years old. Melanie is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Melanie owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods & snack foods, in the local community. She changed her business from a mini restaurant to a retail store because she finds it more profitable. Melanie is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Melanie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Melanie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional inventory & fund working capital. Melanie is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products like beverages & instant noodles. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Melanie from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":662728,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

They have four children who are 19 to 33 years old. \r\n\r\nDeolita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Deolita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 29,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 16,000 PHP, improving her family's standard of living. This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing 29,500 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for the future of her family.

Margaret owns a grocery kiosk in which she sells fruits and vegetables to the local people. She has been in this business for the past five years.

She is divorced and lives with her father, mother, sister and 3-year-old daughter in her parents home.  Merly sells food such as breakfasts and set menus, as well as meals for the workers of a gas company and a sawmill.  She started two years ago at the request of the gas company and a year later began providing meals to the sawmill.  Her mother helps with the food preparation and customer service.  She enjoys her work because she likes to cook and prepare new kinds of food to surprise her customers.  In the future she would like to expand her business and open a restaurant in a central part of the city where she could become very popular.  This is her second loan through the MFP institution.  She hopes to receive a small loan so she can meet her goals.  She is committed to paying back the loan on time as done previously.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have six children who range in age from 19 to 38 years old. \r\n\r\nMelly joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1992 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Melly has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of 7,000 PHP, thus bettering the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th loan cycle, she is borrowing 15,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase fresh meat and vegetable for her fast-food eatery so that she can continue to save up for the future and for her youngest child's schooling.

With nostalgia, this happily married father of two children recalls how his business basked in high profit returns at its onset. Times have changed, however, as the business now is in diminishing returns, earning him 150,000 Ugandan shillings in sharp contrast to previous earnings due to seasonal changes.\r\n\r\nMoses is no exception herein in terms of doing business. What he is looking forward to now is the prospect of enhancing his business by buying fertilizer and improving the production of beans and maize which he grows most. He has other income generating activities like a bar and a butcher shop. With this loan, he will improve his production and can afford business expansion. His revenue will increase and also he can make himself more able to meet his day-to-day life and family

He lives in a traditional large extended family in Hamdallaye, a peripheral area of the town of Sikasso (the third administrative district of Mali).\r\n\r\nNot having had the chance to attend school and coming from a family of blacksmiths, he quickly learned this family trade early on and became a blacksmith as well. He purchases aluminum in Bamako in order to make various objects out of it (pots, tea kettles, plates, spoons etc).\r\nWith his long experience and good business reputation, he is very much in demand as clients appreciate the high quality of his service. At present, given his limited means, he is unable to satisfy the growing customer demand. He joined the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution  over a year ago and already obtained a loan, perfectly repaid.  And so, in order to continue growing his business and better satisfy the growing demand, he is seeking a second loan to purchase 950 kg [approx. 2100 lbs] of aluminum and some additional materials.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, he plans to achieve a monthly revenue of 300,000 West African Francs. The revenues from this activity will allow him to repay his loan and provide for his family\u2019s needs as well as reinvest the remaining funds into this business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":632654,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Blacksmith","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchasing aluminum and additional materials","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-11-04T02:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nouhoum ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.66}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":358.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":358.34},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":358.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":358.33,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":169120.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613662},{"amount":358.34,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:46Z","rounded_local_amount":169120.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606360},{"amount":358.33,"local_amount":166666.66,"processed_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":169120.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360935}],"funded_date":"2010-11-04T07:04:53Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":248904,"name":"Rasheeda's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rasheeda lives in a small city called Kot Radha Kishan which is located in Punjab Pakistan and famous for its agriculture and dairy industry.

F. is a married woman who lives in Brgy. Pangobilian, Brooke's Point, Palawan. She earns her living by operating a food market business.  Her husband Carlos, who is 58 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have four children who are 30 to 34 years old. Lourdes joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lourdes has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 24,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 17,000, improving the family's standard of living. This time, for her 17th loan, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use to buy meat and vegetables for her food market so she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Lourdes F. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Concerned about making their plantations profitable, they decided to join the loan program of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso four years ago. After properly repaying the previous loans, they are now on their fourth farm loan.\r\n\r\nHAWA, standing in the middle in the photo, intends to use her loan to buy a sufficient quantity of peanut seeds, sundry supplies and equipment, and inputs for farming. These items are purchased at the main market of Kimparana City. \r\n\r\nFollowing the off-season, the harvested crops are stocked for a certain time, so that they gain value, and then are sold at the retail level and for cash at the main market of Kimparana and at surrounding markets. The customers generally come from large cities. \r\n\r\nAfter selling their produce, the group members each plan on making a profit of 45,000 to 70,000 francs CFA that will be used to repay the loan interest and to cover typical family expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":789521,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy farm inputs, seeds, and tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Moribila Kafonon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maramou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Minata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niefila ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maramou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali Moussa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hawa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":485000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":485000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":485000,"processed_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-17T08:31:50Z","rounded_local_amount":485314.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424523}],"funded_date":"2011-07-07T00:21:55Z","paid_date":"2012-04-17T08:31:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":310368,"name":"Susana Celia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Susana es socia del Banco Comunal \u201cSan Juan de Tahuaco\u201d ubicado en Centro Poblado Sanquira, distrito de Yunguyo, provincia Yunguyo y departamento de Puno, tiene 26 a\u00f1os de edad, es conviviente y tiene 01 hijo.

Hern\u00e1ndez, and I am a businesswoman. I started my business more than 10 years ago, selling children\u2019s clothing in street markets in the towns around San Pedro Sacatep\u00e8quez where I live. My husband worked alongside me in the business, but as we have six children, we didn\u2019t earn enough money just doing that. After a lot of effort, we managed to rent a stall in the market, and for the last year I have been selling frequently used products. I am asking for a loan so that I can invest in products that the customers demand and that I need to stock so as to increase my customer base. I am very happy as I have gradually seen my business grow. However, my dream is to finish paying for the market stall so that it is finally mine. Then I can enlarge it, and with the income from that, I can provide better education for my children--of the six, only 2 are in school--but I want all of them to go to school and do well.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nSoy Marta Isabel G.

His plans for the future are to fix his house because, during the rainy season, thanks to the poor condition of the roof, it leaks.  He would like to see his house finished but, because of his low income, he hasn't been able to complete construction.  With this financing he will buy building materials so that he can improve his quality of life.

Su mayor desaf\u00edo se presenta a principios del a\u00f1o, porque se disminuyen sus ventas,  pero el se prepara ahorrando para cuando llegue esta \u00e9poca, porque alg\u00fan d\u00eda espera  lograr una buena ubicaci\u00f3n de su punto de servicio  en su casa propia \n","en":"Rafael C. is a very cheerful man who lives with his wife and their two children (ages 15 and 17) in the municipality of Malambo.  He is a hard worker who went to school to learn the electronics trade 15 years ago.  With the goal of supporting his family, he undertook his dream of having his own business.  This is how his home electronics repair shop was born.  At first, he worked in the Soledad municipality, and now his shop is located in Malambo.  He not only offers repair services there, but he also sells secondhand home electronics.  His neighbors and the community of Malambo in general have become his customers.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will buy secondhand home electronics with this loan, as well as spare parts for repairing the damaged devices that his clients bring in.  The previous loans have made it easier for him to purchase merchandise and the parts needed to maintain or repair home electronics.  Rafael hopes to continue growing with the help of this organization, because his dream is to buy his own home and to see his children finish university.  He faces his greatest challenge at the beginning of the year, when sales drop.  However, he has prepared by saving for this period, because one day he hopes to have a good spot to run his shop out of his own home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":622809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics

Finishing only elementary school, Concepcion is ever determined to break people's low expectations of her. She is married to Danilo, a carpenter, and they have been blessed with two children who are still studying in high school. \r\n\r\nConcepcion's home serves both as an abode of rest and a venue for business, because at her home she has set up a junk shop to earn a living. She buys and sells a wide range of junk items, like plastics, bottles, newspapers, old and damaged kitchen and home appliances and the like. With this, Concepcion earns a net average of 300 PHP per day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting for a 20,000 PHP loan.

She lives with her three children in her own house. For more than six months she has been selling food, in particular, breakfasts, as an ambulatory vendor. Her sales spot is in front of a private university that is near her house. Sometimes her daughter helps her tend her business, waiting on customers in the mornings. Her best sales are from April to December, when classes are in session. Nevertheless, when the vacation period comes, she finds it advantageous to work at another business; in this way she doesn't stop earning income. So she knits articles of clothing to sell later.\r\n\r\nSabina considers any business that she proposes to be very important, but now she wants to intensify and increase her food business. This is her fourth loan with MFP. She is very happy to know that she has financial support, since she has always shown that she is responsible in her payments.

She lives in Bayawan City, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2007 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 20,000. Julieta is  borrowing PHP 30,000 so that she  can fund operations. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 30,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Julieta aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way.\r\n\r\n About NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a hardworking single mother of three children, who are between the ages of four and seven. She is also a loving guardian to her two brothers who came into her care after the death of their parents. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using money saved from selling charcoal, Salome opened up a cosmetics shop two years ago. She created the shop by partitioning part of her residence in Namasuba. She sells perfumes, hair additions, hair relaxers, and lotions, among other things. These sales earn her a minimum profit of UGX 60,000 per week. Besides, she also sells safe piped-water to households in her locality at the rate of UGX 50 per jerrican.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>She would therefore use the loan to purchase cosmetics, like Movit relaxer and treatment, TCB Naturals, botanical marrow, mayonnaise treatment, Venus, and Dark & Lovely, among others. This added inventory will allow her to meet the rising demands of customers and also compete favourably in the market. She has an ambition to open up a ladies' boutique and also ensure those entrusted into her care go through their education successfully at all levels.<\/p>

En consecuencia Norma se levanta cerca de las 5 de la ma\u00f1ana para preparar los alimentos para que a las 8 de la ma\u00f1ana pueda llevar su ganado al campo y as\u00ed le alcanze el tiempo para llevar el almuerzo a su esposo, el cual trabaja en la chacra, ayud\u00e1ndolo, con la siembra de habas, papas y ma\u00edz. Pero algunas veces se le presentan dificultades; como la rancha (plaga que se ocasiona por la exesiva lluvia, ocasionando que el gusano afecte directamente el fruto), por ello tiene que estar verificando constantemente sus cultivos y de ese modo tratar de contrarrestar los males que acechan su chacra y as\u00ed salvar sus cosechas. A Norma le agrada la agricultura aunque no siempre gane tanto como se lo propone, sus planes a corto y largo plazo est\u00e1n basados en las ganancias de su producci\u00f3n. Norma tiene el cargo de vocal en el banco comunal al que pertenece, este es su 2do pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y en todo este tiempo ha demostrado pagar sus cuotas con mucha responsabilidad. El dinero que solicita es para comprar abono, nitratos y dem\u00e1s pesticidas para contrarrestar al gusano que asecha su chacra de habas y as\u00ed logre obtener su producto en buen estado para que sea atractivo para la venta.","en":"Norma is 28 years old and has lived with her husband  for 11.5 years. She is the mother of two children who live in her home. Her parents were farmers and she inherited their land along with the responsibility to work that land, being the only her only source to generate income for herself and support her family. Consequently Norma gets up around 5 in the morning to prepare meals so that at 8 in the morning she can take her cattle to pasture and in this way have enough time to take her husband lunch. He works on the farm, helping with the planting of beans, potatoes, and corn. But sometimes they have difficulty; as when the mold from excessive rain causes the worms to affect the crop, so he has to be constantly checking his crops and in this way attempt to prevent the pestilences that can affect the farm and in this way save his crops. Normal likes farming even though she doesn\u2019t always earn as much money as she hopes. Her short term and long term plans are based on her earnings from her crop production. Norma has the spokesperson position in her communal bank. This is her second loan with MFP and in all this time she has demonstrated great responsibility with her payments. The  money she seeks is to buy fertilizer, nitrates, and other pesticides to counteract the worm that affects her bean crop and in this way be able to have her products be good quality and attractive for its sale.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cindy Kendall, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":279985,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy fertilizer and pesticide","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-28T20:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":116.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":116.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":122.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117205},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:41:30Z","rounded_local_amount":122.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012116},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:53:56Z","rounded_local_amount":122.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595701},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:26Z","rounded_local_amount":122.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989963},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":116.67,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:58Z","rounded_local_amount":122.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211094},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":116.65,"processed_date":"2009-08-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":122.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640595}],"funded_date":"2009-02-28T23:26:57Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Kendall","image":797722}},{"id":96485,"name":"Gregoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gregoria tiene 44 a\u00f1os, vive en la casa que consigui\u00f3 con mucho sacrifico y trabajando mucho, es soltera y lo que m\u00e1s desea es tener una vejez tranquila.

She lives in the house she was able to get through much sacrifice and hard work.   She is single, and what she wants most of all is to be worry free when she reaches her old age.  She has been in the business of making ice cream for 9 years.  Up until now everything has gone very well.  She makes ice cream to distribute to the stores where she has contracts.  The customers buy her ice cream quickly because it tastes so good.  What she likes best about her work is the freedom she has.  She is able to see to her business, and at the same time she can take care of her home.  What she does not like is how cold she gets every time she makes the ice cream.  In the future, Gregoria would like to have her own ice cream parlor where she could sell her ice cream.  She knows that the road to achieving her goals is difficult, but she is determined to meet the challenge.  This is her fourth loan with MFP.  She has always made her payments on time, and she expects to be able to do the same with this loan as well.  She is very active in her community bank.

She has five children and unfortunately, the twin babies inside her womb were aborted just recently for reasons she don't know. It was a indeed a heartbreak for Marlene and her husband, Jimmy, because they did not know that the six month fetus inside her womb were twins. Because of poverty and no enough nutritious food taken, she might have not given them proper nurture. However, Marlene had to move on with her life and her dreams for her other five children. She recently applied for a loan in ASHI amounting to PhP 48,000 in order to purchase a motorcycle in installment basis having a downpayment of Php20,000 and sidecar in cash payment of Php30,000 for her tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar attached to it) for her husband to drive. \r\n\r\nTricycle is one of the main means of transportation of people coming in and out of the village all throughout the municipality. Marlene's husband has been driving a tricycle for hire owned by other people for 20 years now. This is Marlene's daily source of income since her farming business which was her primary business since the beginning of her membership in ASHI, can only generate income every four months. With the increasing need of her family finances her husband and their farming business can hardly sustain, they have to increase their income. Having their own tricycle to be driven by her husband, the whole of his daily earnings will go to the family because he doesn't have to pay for the tricycle rental. \r\n\r\nHaving been a very good member of ASHI in the past nine years, showing a very good performance in payment, attendance and business, there would be no doubt that Marlene will be able to do better with her present loan applied. Her dreams of giving her children better education and better life motivates her to move on and make good in her business.

There are 11 members.  They are very hard-working small business owners who look to improve the condition of their economic lives through their businesses.  They do this to give their families the best every day.  \r\n\r\nHere is Mar\u00eda Rita\u2019s case.  I am 52, married, and have two adult children.  I started as a small businesswoman over 15 years ago because I saw that my husband\u2019s salary was not enough to improve our house made of reeds and corrugated metal or to buy things for the house.  I sold kerosene from my house, I boarded people, I cleaned houses, and I then sold gelatin and fruit lollipops.  I always had my husband\u2019s support.  \r\n\r\nThe time came when I decided to establish a small store.  To do this I bought a little bit of each thing (rice, sugar, eggs, noodles, potatoes, oil, milk, detergent, and others).  I invested the earnings each time in setting up the store more.  Now, my store is one of the best stocked in the area where I live.  This helped me build my house from strong material, help my mother, give my son a post high school education (police), and pay other expenses.\r\n\r\nI need the loan to get merchandise like detergent, rice, and sugar.

They lives in the neighborhood of Las Calamares in the southwestern section of Cartagena de Indias.\r\n<p>\r\nShe sells fish while her husband works as a carpenter.  Therefore, she has two reasons why she is applying for a loan worth 2,000,000 COP.  She plans to buy a sufficient quantity of fish to sell during Holy Week as well as wood to make furniture requested by her husband\u2019s customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nAna started her business in 2001 when she bought a freezer.  She began with 200,000 COP of savings, which she accumulated coin by coin and kept in a piggy bank.  Ana was determined to sell her products even though she had no experience and had to deal with her mother\u2019s health problems and a child who left home.  Slowly she was able to move forward with her business and also support her husband with his carpentry, since he is well-known for his trade.  Ana decided to apply for a loan from the Foundation in order to strengthen both businesses at the same time by expanding them, especially the carpentry business since it had been in operation already for two years.  It is now the primary family business.\r\n<p>\r\n This is Ana\u2019s seventh loan with the Foundation. She began with a loan of 1,200,000 COP and has received as much as 2,800,000 COP.  Ana is grateful to the organization because it has helped to simultaneously support two family businesses that have grown since receiving the first loan.  This has also improved her conditions at home and helped her son who has now started his own family.   \r\n<p>\r\nAna hopes that the carpentry business will grow so that she can work with it full-time.  At the moment, she supplements this work by selling fish and with a job working at a hotel to earn additional income.  She recognizes that her goal will be achieved when the carpentry business generates enough income to fully support her household.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva
