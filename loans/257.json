She lives with her children in the H\u00e9r\u00e9makono Nord district of the town of Bougouni (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). \r\n\r\nFor social reasons, Djeneba never went to a modern school, but to a \"m\u00e9dersa\" (private islamic school which offers a religious education). As a housewife, she became interested in income-generating activities only after her husband died, and then in order to provide for her own needs as well as those of her children. For this reason she decided to run a business selling shop items. She learned this trade with one of her dead husband's friends. \r\n\r\nHaving had five years experience, she now masters the business well. In order to satisfy her sharply increasing customer base better, she has joined the loan programme at Soro Yiriwaso and is on her first individual loan with this company. With the loan she is planning to buy various items for her shop. She stocks up at Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali) and sells to a customer base of local people, on a retail basis, for cash and on credit. She hopes to make a monthly profit of 60,000 FCFA. With this profit she plans to expand her shop.   \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva

The Yiriwa group deals in various products: incense, soap, stainless steel cups, peanut butter, cookies made from millet, tea, and telephone cards.\r\nThey decided to get involved with Soro Yiriwaso with the goal of increasing their working capital, and they are on their third joint loan. \r\nMrs. Fatoumata S., who is quite successful at selling peanut butter, plans to use her loan to buy five sacks of peanuts.  She gets her peanuts wholesale at the market in Konodimini.\r\nTo make peanut butter, the peanuts are shelled (by hand), she selects the best peanuts for grilling and then takes them to the mill for grinding.  The resulting peanut butter is ready to be sold in small pots or at retail in small plastic bags. Her clientele consists mainly of women who buy from her home and in the town of S\u00e9gou, who pay in cash and sometimes on credit. \r\nLike the other members of the group, Fatoumata S. hopes to make an average monthly profit of 35, 000 FCFA which will used to pay for their children\u2019s schooling and to reinvest in their business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Shannon Arnold, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1625,"image":{"id":530091,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy peanuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Dougounikoro ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-05-01T17:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1625,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Saran                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dj\u00e8n\u00e8ba                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ami                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia                        ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata      ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assan            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assan            ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kala              ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.84},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.83},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":270.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":270.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":270.83,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":134351.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779241},{"amount":270.84,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:53Z","rounded_local_amount":134351.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961452},{"amount":270.83,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":134351.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699568},{"amount":270.83,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:32Z","rounded_local_amount":134351.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913461},{"amount":270.84,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:19Z","rounded_local_amount":134351.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180635},{"amount":270.83,"local_amount":133333.35,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":134351.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476602}],"funded_date":"2010-05-02T21:50:35Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Arnold","image":null}},{"id":200150,"name":"Phanna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Phanna D., 25, and her husband, Mr. Mun Khoem, 30, live on an island in the Mekong River about 15 kilometers from Phnom Penh City.

Teresita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Teresita joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase house materials. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fishing equipment including hooks & nets. This will be the 6th loan taken out by Teresita from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is married to Romeo, a mechanic, and she is a mother to four children, two of whom are already studying in college and the other two are in high school. She, together with her husband and children, manage their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nHelen operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Helen earns income by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 400 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 22,000 loan. She will utilize the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nHelen hopes to be able to expand her business soon and be able to send all of her children all the way through college.

After several years of training alongside them, she finished by starting her own business, choosing to sell clothes and shoes. She has run this business for 15 years now and has extensive experience and a large clientele. Her strength in sales is due to the quality of her items, which are imported.\r\nWith the hope of meeting her customers' demands, she turned to Soro Yiriwaso and has been working with this institution for 60 months.

She will then sell retail at the great market to a clientele of women and men, for cash or credit.\r\n\r\nShe expects this funding will generate monthly profits of 110.000 FCFA she intends to use to reimburse Soro loan interests and contribute to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nLooking to the future, Mariam plans to diversify her business activity."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":939753,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy bags of groundnuts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-12-07T20:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.84},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:47:50Z","rounded_local_amount":83515.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283251},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:21Z","rounded_local_amount":83515.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424761},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-11T08:19:36Z","rounded_local_amount":83515.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270140026},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:17:52Z","rounded_local_amount":83515.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276757000},{"amount":170.84,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2012-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T19:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":83515.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283251765},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2012-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:29Z","rounded_local_amount":83515.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287410771}],"funded_date":"2011-12-16T18:43:20Z","paid_date":"2012-07-15T10:18:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":372288,"name":"Donna Kerr","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Donna Kerr is a 31-year-old, married woman.

Lleva 20 a\u00f1os realizando esta actividad y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es transportar sus cultivos hasta la ciudad de San Francisco, pues es ah\u00ed donde vende sus productos.

She is a hardworking woman, who lives at home with her husband, Eliseo, aged 56, and her seven dear children, for whom she wants to provide a better quality of life. \n\nTogether with her husband Eliseo, Dina works every day on their land.  With much effort she has been able to make their land be very productive and she plants a little of everything, as she knows that any product she gets will be good.  She mainly plants cocoa and coffee plants, as these are the best selling products in the market. \n\nWhat she likes most about her job is protecting her crops from the insect infestations that can affect them and which would greatly reduce her profits.\n\nShe has spent 20 years doing this, and believes that the most difficult part is transporting their crops to the city of San Francisco, for that is where she sells her products.  On the other hand, the insect infestations affect the plants and therefore Dina will use the requested loan to buy mesh to make screens to protect the plants from the insects who take over the fruit. \n\nThis will be her tenth loan through MFP, so she hopes for a little support from lenders to carry out her plan, and she is capable of repaying all their contributions promptly, as with her previous loans.  In her community bank, she is a very supportive partner for the rest of her colleagues. \n\nWith the 3,000 New Soles, she will buy meshes by the meter to make screens and combat the insects that lurk in her crops."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":818104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy several meters of mesh.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-22T22:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":326.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":341.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":357},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":367.25},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":382.56},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":394.61},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":408.01},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":422.57}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.63},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.3},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":130.9},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":134.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":140.27},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":144.69},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":149.61},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":154.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":119.63,"local_amount":326.25,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:59Z","rounded_local_amount":327.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350755},{"amount":125.3,"local_amount":341.75,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:34Z","rounded_local_amount":342.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851119},{"amount":130.9,"local_amount":357,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:40Z","rounded_local_amount":358.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666296},{"amount":134.66,"local_amount":367.25,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:33Z","rounded_local_amount":368.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621453},{"amount":140.27,"local_amount":382.56,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:44Z","rounded_local_amount":383.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835527},{"amount":144.69,"local_amount":394.61,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:57Z","rounded_local_amount":396.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245289},{"amount":149.61,"local_amount":408.01,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":409.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385412},{"amount":154.94,"local_amount":422.57,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":424.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098535}],"funded_date":"2011-07-23T14:25:58Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Arabella Pollack","image":null}},{"id":323099,"name":"Celsa Dolores","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Esta se\u00f1ora es originaria de telica es maestra del colegio sagrado coraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas, con 25 a\u00f1os de impartir clases, su n\u00facleo familiar consta de 3 personas su esposo y 2 hijos los que estudian  en los colegios de la localidad, est\u00e1 solicitando financiamiento para la compra de zinc y clavos, para la construcci\u00f3n de mejora de vivienda, el d\u00eda laborar de esta se\u00f1ora es salir a las 6 de la  ma\u00f1ana teniendo que transportar autob\u00fas y recorrer 12 km, dicho cr\u00e9dito le ayudara a mejorar sus condiciones y nivel de vida.","en":"\r\nThis lady is from Telica.

In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5 worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nMylene dreams to be able to give all her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":922519,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-11-22T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mylene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2011-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":3333,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3615.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529539},{"amount":83.34,"local_amount":3334,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":3616.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738768},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2891.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146000},{"amount":16.67,"local_amount":667,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":723.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275065}],"funded_date":"2011-11-23T07:43:12Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dara Olmsted Silverstein","image":973449}},{"id":364110,"name":"Mira","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mira is 35 years old and lives in the Philippines.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":351089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-07-11T14:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Neema ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:44Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73665075},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:49:57Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105787},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:22Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022897},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:44:46Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868138},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:58Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757334},{"amount":66.65,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:50Z","rounded_local_amount":87400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146428}],"funded_date":"2009-07-12T08:21:03Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":125577,"name":"Maria Concepcion","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la sra.

The results were positive and he was able to repay ahead of schedule.

She has been producing milk, maize, beans and pineapples, all of which she sells to the local market. Her primary challenge in farming has been lack of enough animal feed that affects her milk production, and lack of reliable casual labourers. She is also employed and earns extra income from her retail shop and rental houses in the same area.\n\nEsther is 50 years old. She is married and has three children between the ages of 11 and 19. All her children are attending school.\n\nShe has requested this loan from Juhudi Kilimo for 45,000 Kenyan shillings to purchase and insure a dairy cow. The extra income from this loan will improve the standard of living of the family since there will be more disposable income from the sale of milk. In future, she would like to increase the size of her land and plant more dairy feed. She also plans to increase her rental houses and the number of her dairy cows. \n\nEsther is part of a 5 person solidarity group -- when one receives a loan, the others guarantee it.  As it is her rotation, this loan is for Esther's business alone.  She says, however, that group lending is sometimes discouraging because not all members are reliable. She hopes Juhudi will consider giving loans without requiring solidarity groups in future.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":563784,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He never went to school but he is quite smart and has considerable entrepreneurship skills.  He is married and the father of 6 children.  Khan has an auto spare parts shop.  He\u2019s been in this business for more than 3 decades.  However, he did not own such a shop all the time but worked for others especially during a decade as a refugee in Iran.  The household returned to Afghanistan a few years ago.<P>\r\n\r\nKhan has applied for an individual loan to expand his inventory for his auto spare parts shop.  He initially invested 50,000 Afghani (about US$ 1,100) but just a few years after his return from Iran, his capital has grown by as much as six times.

He is a merchant who sells metal furniture and home appliances like electric ovens, toasters, irons, mixers, blenders, etc.  Right now, Mario lacks funds to invest in inventory since just about everything is already sold to various customers.  But, because he extends his items on credit, he is unable to gather enough funds all at once to buy more merchandise.  For this reason, he is requesting financing to buy home appliances so that he can have better sales and higher profits, especially now during the Christmas selling season when sales are at their best.  He is very happy because his business is allowing his family, who is the most important thing he owns, to get ahead.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

120,000 francs CFA that will allow her to help her husband and to take part in societal events.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

He lives in a very friendly neighborhood of hard-working people to the south of the city.  There he makes clothing such as pants and women's shirts for a living.  He learned this activity, even though he didn't have any prior experience, thanks to his sister who, for many years, worked in a clothing company.  There was a time when he felt hopeless because he didn't have a job and she made him her manager.  There he learned how to make clothing and operate the machines and this is precisely what he has been doing with his life.  With his sister's help he was able to buy his own house and organize it, in addition to the many achievements that have contributed to his happiness.  Now his young daughter is following in his footsteps as she is very attached to him and watches him work.  In her free time she plays at making clothing for her dolls.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, Robinson's business is generating jobs and he plans to increase his production through the use of working capital that he will obtain through loans.  This is the reason he is requesting a Kiva loan which he will use to buy fabrics and supplies in volume to increase his production and respond to his customers who demand new and modern designs.  While Robinson works to attain his goals, he manages his business with a profit margin of no less than  25% which he plans to increase little by little and a liquidity of 3 to 1.  \r\n\r\nHis greatest challenge is to see his children become successful professionals as they are what drives him in life.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nLorna operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, 5 pesos worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house, and her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 800 Philippines pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a loan of 32,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.\r\n\r\nLorna hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of giving her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and to draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":980859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2012-01-13T20:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lorna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":32000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2133.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":2133.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":12799.98,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:45Z","rounded_local_amount":13196.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257146163},{"amount":200,"local_amount":8533.02,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:01:53Z","rounded_local_amount":8797.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263275378},{"amount":250,"local_amount":10667,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:12Z","rounded_local_amount":10997.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269997877}],"funded_date":"2012-01-13T21:55:43Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:48:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Erin Henderson","image":1126934}},{"id":614512,"name":"Ahmedwali Hassan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ahmedwali Hassan is 23 years old.

Thi Nguyen, 42 years old, joined the Fund in 2001.  Her family's main profession is working the farm and building milling machines.  When joining the fund, the family made plans to invest in raising livestock, and with the income from this business they built milling machines.  They then used the milling machines to process waste wheat and rice for the pigs, so the cost of feed is kept very low.  Each year, on average, the family produces about 500 kg of pigs.  Doing business involving the livestock operation fits the family very well, their finances are improving day by day.  She has 3 children, 2 who are still in school and 1 who is working and helping to support the family.  In this round of funding she and the family are requesting 16,000,000 to continue investing in livestock.  Their average income is 5,000,000 VND per month. \r\nTranslated from Vietnamese by Chi Nguyen, Kiva volunteer.\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb T\u00ednh 42 tu\u1ed5i, tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 2001, ngh\u1ec1 nghi\u1ec7p ch\u00ednh c\u1ee7a gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb l\u00e0 l\u00e0m ru\u1ed9ng v\u00e0 l\u00e0m m\u00e1y xay s\u00e1t, khi tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb \u0111\u00e3 b\u00e0n b\u1ea1c \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 v\u00e0o ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i l\u1ee3n, v\u1edbi thu\u1eadn l\u1ee3i gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb l\u00e0m m\u00e1y xay s\u00e1t n\u00ean t\u00e2n d\u1ee5ng \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c c\u00e1m, t\u1ea5m th\u1eeba v\u00e3i n\u00ean chi ph\u00ed \u0111\u1ea7u t\u01b0 th\u1ee9c \u0103n cho vi\u1ec7c ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i l\u1ee3n c\u1ee7a gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb l\u00e0 r\u1ea5t \u00edt, h\u00e0ng n\u0103m b\u00ecnh qu\u00e2n ra \u0111\u00ecnh chi xu\u1ea5t kho\u1ea3ng 5 t\u1ea1 l\u1ee3n, kinh doanh k\u1ebft h\u1ee3p c\u00f9ng v\u1edbi ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i \u0111\u00f3 ch\u00ednh l\u00e0 m\u1ed9t c\u00e1ch l\u00e0m \u0103n r\u1ea5t t\u1ed1t v\u1edbi gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb, kinh t\u1ebf gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb ng\u00e0y m\u1ed9t ph\u00e1t tri\u1ec3n, ch\u1ecb c\u00f3 3 con, 2 con \u0111ang c\u00f2n \u0111i h\u1ecdc, 1 con \u0111ang \u0111\u00e3 \u0111i l\u00e0m v\u00e0 c\u00f3 thu nh\u1eadp ph\u1ee5 gi\u00fap gia \u0111\u00ecnh.

He lives in his own home with his wife Herlinda (age 42) and their two beloved children, Paty (age 15) and Melina (age 9).  Armando wants to provide his children a better quality of life.  Since he is an extremely hard worker, Armando knows that he must invest all of his efforts to achieve success in life.  He grows potatoes, corn, and peas.  Once the harvest season arrives, he brings his products to the wholesale market in Tarma to sell to his customers.  They are knowledgeable of the quality of his crops, which explains why they are bought up so quickly.  What he enjoys most about his work is protecting his crops from disease.  Armando has been farming for twenty years and considers the most difficult part to be transporting his crops to market to sell since the sacks are very heavy.  Going forward, he wants to buy additional farmland so that he can increase his planting.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his fifth loan with MFP.  Armando knows that he must submit his payments on time so that he can access subsequent loans.  He is an active participant in his Communal Bank.

Besides the livestock business, she also sells goods at the market.  Her husband is also a man who knows how to shoulder his share of the work, and he works as a day laborer and earns about 1,500,000 VND per month.  With Mrs. Nguyen\u2019s and her husband\u2019s two jobs, the family always has a continual income stream each month.  Since they have been participating in the Fund, the family has always fulfilled their responsibilities as participants.  They are very happy that their participation in the Fund has expanded their business and finances so they can take care of their children and send them to school.  In this round of funding the couple is requesting 9,000,000 VND to continue farming pigs.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":270907,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing

Margaret runs a small \"buy and sell\" stand in Nkwen Market.  With this loan, she plans to invest in more products to sell at her stand.  Some of these products include rice, onions, groundnut oil, beans, tomatoes, salt, palm oil, and soybeans.  Her business plan shows she will invest 50,000 CFA of her own savings as well.  \r\n \r\nThis will be Margaret's second loan from GHAPE.  She has been quite successful in the past with her business due to her location (right on the main Market), the variety of her products, and her reasonable prices.  She purchases most of her products where they are much cheaper, and sells them at her stall.  For many customers in her community, this saves the transportation costs and the time of going to Bamenda themselves to purchase these items.  She has a strong customer base and is confident that she will be able to increase her sales. \r\n \r\nThe profits from this loan will be used for the school fees of Margaret's children. Also, she plans to reinvest in her businesses to help it grow. Margaret does not foresee a problem with her loan repayments as they are quite small repayments every two weeks.  \r\n \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.
