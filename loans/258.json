He is very honest and fair and charges his passengers by distance traveled.\r\nShe has requested a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her husband\u2019s business.

She used this money to buy 100 poultries to raise. 6 months later, she made a profit of 2800 Vietnamese Dong. Acknowledging the high return, the couple kept borrowing money and bought poultry in larger numbers. The business flourished, and the family\u2019s financial situation gradually became stable. \r\nMr. Tien, her husband, is a skillful and curious man.  He spent time studying business. In 2001, when the family\u2019s savings had accumulated, the couple started to build a modern farm on their old fields.  They raised chickens, ducks, and pigs.  They also planted bonsai.  Soon enough, there were thousands of poultries on the farm and hundreds of valuable bonsai.  A select 100 of these bonsai were of the Cau Vua type, a particularly valuable tree in Vietnam. They also planted vegetables to deliver to the local market. The family\u2019s income is from 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 Vietnamese Dong per month. She plans to make the next loan of 19,000,000 Vietnamese Dong to invest in the new farm.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Duc Tran, Kiva

From 2002-2008 his stock levels increased, as did the value of the merchandise, demonstrating the business\u2019s profitability. In July 2008 Katshaya decided to join one of the groups of Hope RDC called \u201cBien Fait,\u201d with the aim of achieving his dream of one day opening an auto parts store in Kinshasa and becoming a supplier. He received three loans from Hope which he repaid as required. The next loan will enable him to buy hybrid cassava seeds to produce large quantities of cassava, which is requested by many people in his neighborhood. Katshaya is 46 years old, married and the father of five children aged between four and 25, the eldest of whom is independent. The four others live with Katshaya and two are at primary school.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2275,"image":{"id":350262,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy cassava cuttings with a view to producing cassava in volume to then sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

She lives with her two sons Charles (24) and Gerardo (15) in a modest house in a populous district south of Lima. From the  time she was 22 years of age, she has worked a great deal, and has made countless trades in order to provide the best for her children. Her goal was to grow and have her own business, which has managed to do, as well as built a home gradually, based on a lot of sweat and sacrifice. She now lives in her home and rents some of the rooms, which has allowed her to be self-sufficient.  Now, she has come to know that she cannot stop the momentum and needs to continue with the repairs\/finishes of her home.  Julia is very proud of what she has achieved and now would like to build other apartments for higher profits, which will help her pay for her children's education and realize another one of her big dreams - to see her children become professionals.\r\n\r\nThis is Julia's ninth loan with MFP credit and she promises to remain compliant with the payments of her loan.  She finds her other peers (other women entrepreneurs) are also very responsible people, and that gives her a sense of security in continuing her working with loans, since this has become essential for her progress. With the money she is requesting now, she plans to purchase cement and tiles for finishing the toilets in her tenants' flats, so that they can feel more comfortable in their homes.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mayra Gould, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":485854,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Mejora de los servicios higi\u00e9nicos de las habitaciones que alquila (To fix\/add finishes to the toilets in the rooms she rents)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-10T21:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":221.62},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":237.79},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":241.39},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":256.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":266.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":276.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.57},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.22},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.49},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.83},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.16},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.73}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.57,"local_amount":221.62,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":222.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960355},{"amount":83.22,"local_amount":237.79,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:31Z","rounded_local_amount":238.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993210},{"amount":84.49,"local_amount":241.39,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":242.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717992},{"amount":89.83,"local_amount":256.66,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":257.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751669},{"amount":93.16,"local_amount":266.17,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":267.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934134},{"amount":96.73,"local_amount":276.37,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:17Z","rounded_local_amount":277.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672908}],"funded_date":"2010-02-12T06:47:38Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mayra Caridad Gould","image":609461}},{"id":179125,"name":"Sengly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"R.

She and her husband live alone now that their children are grown and independent.  Alicia is very active and always working at some money-making activity.  That's why she has two businesses: the first is selling beauty products and the second, which she operates with some neighbors, is selling the kinds of prepared foods that are popular in the neighborhood.  She has 3 years of experience and the businesses are thriving thanks to the level of service she provides to her customers and to her careful administration of the income from the businesses.  Alicia is happy with the businesses because they make her feel useful and productive.  In the future, she wants to consolidate the businesses by setting up a stall in a market, perhaps, or a restaurant in her house.  She likes both businesses so consolidating them makes sense to her.  This is Alicia's third MFP loan and she is committed to repaying it on time, just as she did the loans before.  She will use the money to buy beauty products so that she can fill some existing orders and build a stock for future orders.

He has a neat, spacious yard for the business behind his house.  He feeds the sheep and poultry a balanced diet so that they he can get the best price for them when they're ready for market.

She lives in her home built with a simple structure, like others in her community, with two of her three children in the city of La Romana in one of the rural areas that are called bateys. Most bateys are located in a sugarcane field, and were built for the sugarcane industry workers.\r\n\r\nConsuelo says her most favorites things to do are to take her children to eat ice cream and to the park. And her most important challenge is to continue growing in her life and business. Since two years ago, Consuelo started her clothing sales business with the money she received when she stopped working in a company. \r\n\r\nConsuelo is receiving her first loan from Esperanza Internacional and will invest this capital in her clothing sales business; this loan will be invested to buy new clothes and pants by the dozen.

C. and her husband Marco live on a small farm where they grow rice. On their farm they also raise chickens and pigs as a secondary source of income. Together, they have had three children who are already grown up. They rely on rice farming as their main source of income. Blanca has been a rice farmer for over 35 years, a skill she learned from her parents.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Blanca is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Paypayales Communal Bank are part of a rice farmers cooperative in Santa Lucia named Dios Con Nosotros (God is with us). They will use the microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Dios con Nosotros Cooperative are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":19424,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Farm Rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-12T17:43:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blanca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-26T23:13:02Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":325,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":46.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":46.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":46.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":26,"local_amount":26,"processed_date":"2007-05-17T21:34:23Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16564},{"amount":26,"local_amount":26,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:32:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21968},{"amount":26,"local_amount":26,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:15:28Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29281},{"amount":26,"local_amount":26,"processed_date":"2007-08-06T23:44:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":39724},{"amount":26,"local_amount":26,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T21:03:18Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53273},{"amount":195,"local_amount":195,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:07:12Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:26:29Z","rounded_local_amount":195,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65644}],"funded_date":"2007-03-12T23:13:02Z","paid_date":"2007-10-10T20:07:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":10557,"name":"Mushviq","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mushviq M. was born and raised in the Aghsu region of Azerbaijan.

She has had six children, one of whom died. Now, three of her children still live at home. While the family has tried their hand at a variety of business over the years, they have always been farmers. A farmer's wife, Anselma has always shared in the agricultural work, planting coffee, cocoa and plantains. For the past 8 months, she has also sold fruit and vegetables at the market with her cousin, who has a stall there. Anselma has been happy with the income her plantain crops have been bringing in, but her experience with her cousin has made her realize how much more money she could make if she sold her crops herself, rather than selling them wholesale to the buyers that come directly to the farm. She has become very motivated to get her own market stall and in this way, increase her earnings. This will be her first loan from MFP, and also the first time that she has ever been part of a Communal Bank. She is committed to making her payments punctually and really looks forward to working with her group. She will use the loan to buy fertilizer for her fields and also, to buy some potatoes in bulk that she will use as capital until her coffee plants are ready to be cultivated. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":269824,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer and potatoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-12T02:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anselma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":131.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423755},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:42:16Z","rounded_local_amount":131.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117040},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:53:17Z","rounded_local_amount":131.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011953},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:24Z","rounded_local_amount":131.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595539},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":131.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989800},{"amount":40.58,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:32Z","rounded_local_amount":131.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210935},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:04Z","rounded_local_amount":131.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640441},{"amount":40.66,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":131.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080112}],"funded_date":"2009-02-12T04:16:20Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sara Sultan","image":null}},{"id":92501,"name":"Vicenta Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa Se\u00f1ora Vicenta del Socorro P.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a widow of 74 years of age and has 7 independent children. This bank member completed her primary education. <p>\r\nElena has spent about 5 years working as a seamstress and crochet maker. Little by little she was able to generate her own income and to save her money. Her business is located in her own home in a comfortable place where she can attend to her customers. She repairs blouses and dresses, and also crochets baby clothes, tablecloths, etc. She tells us that she is doing very well and has advance orders from her customers. With her first loan of 300 Soles, she bought fabric in different colors and sizes and she invested part of the money in wool yarns of different types for her crochet. <p>\r\nShe is currently continuing to run her business and she has loyal customers who come daily to her house with their orders, and she attends to them personally with her characteristic kindness. <p>\r\nWith this loan of $425, she will buy cloth maD. of various fabrics by the meter, crochet tools, needles for hand- and machine-sewing, pins, buttons, and different colored threads. <p>\r\nToday, Elena feels herself to be a very accomplished woman with more drive to acheive and realize her dreams.

She lives with her mother in the rural community of Calaz\u00e1n in the Monsef\u00fa district, located 15 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor more than 3 years she has worked raising and selling animals.

The guinea pigs are highly valued for their meat; they have been consumed throughout the country since ancient times.\r\n\r\nMargarita wants to expand her business by purchasing more guinea pigs to raise and sell.  In addition, she wants to buy nutritious feed for them so that they will grow optimally.  For this reason she has seen the necessity of coming for the first time to Edpyme Alternativa to request a loan for 2,000 Peruvian soles that will help her achieve these goals.\r\n\r\nMargarita is a responsible woman who is very dedicated to her work.

Her business is her way of helping her husband to meet the demands of their daily expenses. \r\n\r\nJosephine is in the garment business. She buys raw materials like textiles, buttons, thread, etc. She cuts and sews these into different patterns, depending upon the job order from her clients. There are round neck, v-neck, polo shirts and sometimes office and school uniforms. She caters to the needs of her clients and provides them a satisfaction guaranteed kind of service to have them repeat orders from her. Her business allows her to earn 700 Philippine Pesos (PHP) per day. \r\n\r\nJosephine is requesting a loan amounting to 11,000 PHP that will help as  additional capital. She will spend it to buy additional products she needs in her business. She will prioritize her purchases of the materials that she needs right now for her current order which is for polo shirts. She makes sure that the order is delivered on time as it will add additional points in her negotiations. \"Meeting my clients demand, satisfaction guaranteed will definitely mean additional customers because they will refer me to other companies who need garments,\" she says.\r\n\r\nJosephine dreams of having a more visible shop. Her business location right now is quite far from the highway, there are times when her clients have a hard time finding residence. She is praying to God that one day, she will be able to have enough income that will sustain her to maintain a shop in a more visible area. She never fails to attend the weekly fellowship* as it inspires her to be a more God-fearing and God-loving individual. The fellowship lightens up the load she has, every time they gather together to share the word of God. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay loans. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":896817,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To pay for raw materials she needs in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Batasan, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-10-22T17:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Josephine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":11000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":733.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":733.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":73.33,"local_amount":2933,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3170.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571878},{"amount":73.34,"local_amount":2934,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:32:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3171.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529428},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":3666,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:38:57Z","rounded_local_amount":3962.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250738644},{"amount":36.67,"local_amount":1467,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1585.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257145872}],"funded_date":"2011-10-22T18:44:45Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T09:48:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":351525,"name":"Mable","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mable is a 38-year-old single mother with four children living in a semi-permanent house in Fort Portal, Uganda.

He lives with his wife and children in a large traditional family in M\u00e9dine, one of the neighborhoods of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\nHe never got a chance to go to school and, after a few unsuccessful enterprises, he quickly turned to commercial activites, especially storing and selling cereals, about 10 years ago. He has quite a reputation and gets lots of orders, but he does not have the resources to meet this demand. So, he decided to join Soro Yiriwaso's loan program through which he is applying for a 5th loan. This loan will enable him to increase his working capital in order to better meet the needs of his customers.\r\nWith this 5th loan, he plans on buying 20 bags of corn, 10 bags of rice, and 25 bags of millet from the surrounding communities of Sikasso.

Before becoming a member of the Fund, she faced a lot of difficulties because of having many children and her income came mainly from her farming. She borrowed 20 USD to buy 2 pigs. After 4 months of membership, she earned 40 USD. Seeing that her project was productive, she decided to borrow more to invest in raising animals. In 2004, her husband joined the class about farming and farming projects. After the course, he applied his knowledge and expanded the farm to improve family economy. After 4 years of operation, Mrs. H. and her husband is having a well-equipped farm with a variety of plants, 100 pigs and 1000 chickens. This time, she and her husband want to borrow 1150 USD to invest more in the farm. \r\n<b><p>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><\/b>\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

He leads SESAWI B1 Group - a group of 8 farmers in Usapi Sonbai Village, Kupang District of East Nusa Tenggara Province. Oktofianus has been living in this village since he was a child. His parents are only poor farmers who couldn\u2019t afford to send him to the high school. As a result, Oktofianus only has a primary education. \r\n\r\nOktofianus is a married man with one child aged 10 months. Due to the low level of education that Oktofianus has, he can not get a better permanent job in the city. This is the reason why Oktofianus works as a farmer who plants corn, peanuts and vegetables to pay for his family's needs. The biggest challenge for Oktofianus is the increasing of prices in the market that makes it difficult for him to support his family. His income generated from farming is not enough to cover all of his family's needs. \r\n\r\nThe difficulties that Oktofianus faces have motivated him to find another way to support his family. One of the alternatives that has become his preference is to fatten cattle because of the high demand and good price for the fattened cattle. To fatten cattle Oktofianus needs capital to buy the young cattle and he can not afford it as a poor farmer. \r\n\r\nThis is the reason why Oktofianus is interested in joining the cattle fattening program with the other group members. He is requesting a loan amounting to IDR 3,200,000 to buy young cattle to be fattened for 12 months. Oktofianus hopes that through the cattle fattening program he will be able to cover all of his family needs. The other group members are also requesting a loan as they want to improve their living standard. \r\nNote: When the group picture was taken, Erny and Fransina were replaced by their family member.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2450,"image":{"id":340242,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy cattle to fatten","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Usapi Sonbai","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":129,"posted_date":"2009-06-20T09:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2450,"lender_count":82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oktofianus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ananias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Meliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Meliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Erny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yori","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fransina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yohanis","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":25600000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":2450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":25600000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":918.75,"local_amount":9600000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-26T08:52:39Z","rounded_local_amount":9624549.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159707715},{"amount":1531.25,"local_amount":16000000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-02T09:02:46Z","rounded_local_amount":16040915.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166921833}],"funded_date":"2009-06-23T22:02:50Z","paid_date":"2010-10-02T09:02:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Claire Lloyd-Jones","image":null}},{"id":121189,"name":"Danelia Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Danelia del Carmen Rodr\u00edguez, tiene la edad de 58 a\u00f1os, habita en el barrio Medardo Andino, ubicado en el municipio de Ticuantepe, junto a su esposo el cual le apoya con los gastos del hogar , ellos tiene tres hijos , ya todos independientes , los tres son docentes , los planes hacia su familia es mejorar la vivienda , ella desde hace 20 a\u00f1os tiene a cargo el cafet\u00edn del Instituto de Ticuantepe y a la vez le proporciona el alimento a los docentes , ella inicio esta actividad con sus propios esfuerzos .

C. is 40 and lives with her husband and two children in a community called El Sa\u00edno de Pital, which is located in the province of Alajuela.  The main economic activities here are livestock and agriculture, most notably the production of pineapple.  The pineapple is mainly sold to international markets.  For this reason, the development of the community has grown in recent years, generating a larger demand for products and services, which helps to mitigate the effect of immigration.  Do\u00f1a Sonia has dedicated a large part of her life to working in her home, and she also helps her husband with agriculture.  She recently had the idea of creating an entertainment room in her home so her neighbors could have fun in a healthy way.  Since she started this project, it has been very well accepted in her community.  She has been able to acquire video game machines, foosball tables, and other things.  \r\n\r\nSince her business is going so well, Sonia hopes to obtain a loan of 585,000 colones to buy more video game machines so she can expand her clientele and offer more variety.  Sonia is a member of the communal bank, \"Luz del Futuro Saino,\" one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be her second loan, and with it she hopes to continue to grow on a personal and economic level.  She also stresses that she is thankful to this type of organization and easier ways to access credit so she can dedicate more time to productive activities.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by

He is polygamous and lives with his wives and children in the Darsalam II neighborhood of Koutiala (Sikasso Region). He did not attend school for social reasons.  Thus, he took up his father's line of business at a young age and has operated it for himself for 10 years. He is much sought after by his customers because the less costly and better quality second-hand clothing is much appreciated in Mali. In order to satisfy customer demand, Mr. C. turned to the Soro Yiriwaso microfinance institution, where he has his first loan. He plans to buy 5 bales of second-hand clothing at Burkina Faso with this loan. He conducts his sales principally in cash at the large market in Koutiala under his shed roof to a clientele composed of women and men. With this loan, he expects to make a monthly profit of 100,000 CFA to support himself; namely, to repay the loan, to provide for his family and to invest the rest in his business.

She deals with good number of clients and receives regular orders.\r\n\r\nShabana has applied for a loan from Kiva partner, Asasah for her husband\u2019s shoe-making business. With the loan, her husband will buy items such as leather, a shoe polisher and nails in large quantity to fulfill his larger orders on time. He receives orders from different factories and shoe shops.\r\n\r\nShabana is very confident that this investment will bring positive changes to her husband\u2019s business and that her family will be able to improve their living standard.

Her best days for sales are Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.  Her average weekly sales rise to 500,000 Colombian pesos and her profit margin is 30%.  Anlly says that she decided to start this business at her mom's suggestion and because she couldn't manage to get a job after she finished high school.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Anlly would like to sell lunches as well because her customers have requested them.  She is already saving up to buy chairs, tables and the cooking utensils that she will need.  As her business is beside a soccer field, Anlly tells us that she has become an expert advisor to the technical directors who visit her business and many of them seek her advice in determining their team line-ups.  Anlly loves soccer and it isn't unusual to see her shouting from her kiosk, giving the players from her favorite team instructions.  Through her own hard work and the support of Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, Anlly dreams of having her own home so that she can separate her business from her home and, judging by the enthusiasm

Construction, Inc., a commercial sub-contracting firm specializing in concrete installation.  When Jose started this business three years ago, he was his firm\u2019s only employee.  Now, Jose has 16 full-time employees and the capacity to manage multiple projects simultaneously.  Jose began working in construction 17 years ago as a general laborer.  From there, he worked his way up through the construction industry, gaining experience in cost estimating and project management along the way.  \r\n\r\nJose has a degree in civil engineering from the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), which he earned while working full-time to support his family.  In the eight years that Jose was a student, he took a variety of odd jobs both within and outside of the construction industry.  Instead of going through the motions as he pursued his goal of becoming a civil engineer, Jose took every job as a learning opportunity and a chance for self-improvement.  For example, Jose credits working at Wal-Mart with building the customer service skills he uses daily as a small business owner.  \r\n\r\nRecently, UTEP began offering graduate studies in construction management.  Jose wants to return to school part-time so that he can learn more about the financial side of project management.  He says that his educational and work experience to this point prepared him to design and implement projects, but that management and finance courses will make him a better business owner.\r\n\r\nJose is using this loan as operating capital for his business.  The construction industry in El Paso was really slow during the first few months of 2011.  In order to support himself and his employees, Jose says he rolled the dice in taking projects with several general contractors he otherwise wouldn\u2019t.  The decision backfired when they didn\u2019t pay on time, and Jose\u2019s cash flow diminished to the point that it threatened his ability to pay upcoming bills.  As someone who stakes his reputation on punctuality, Jose decided to take out a small loan for operating capital until business picked up.  In addition to supplying Jose\u2019s business with needed cash, it allows Jose to build his business\u2019 credit.\r\n\r\nWithin the next two to three years, Jose wants to become a general contractor.  To do so, he says the business will need to expand its services and add expertise, which will take time.  In the meantime, Jose believes that there is enough demand for concrete installation that his business can continue expanding its presence as a subcontractor.  \r\n\r\nS. Construction, Inc. is a family owned and operated business.   Jose employs his dad, who has 37 years of experience in the construction industry, as his chief superintendent of projects.  Jose\u2019s wife, Monica, manages the business\u2019 administrative work and finances.  For the time being, they run the business out of their home to keep operating costs low, though Jose anticipates needing to open an office if business continues growing.  Jose and Monica have three children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5575,"image":{"id":789952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cement","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to

is married with three kids. She runs her own business selling children\u2019s clothing in one of the local city markets in Zaporoshye. \r\n\r\nTatyana has been in this trade for two years. Presently, she has about $3,000 of working capital and her monthly profit amounts to $600. There is a lot of competition from similar businesses in the market where Tatyana has her kiosk. However, her competitive prices and client-friendly service give her an advantage in comparison with many of the other typical businesses. Her integrity and determination have helped her enterprise to grow and be successful. \r\n\r\nTatyana realizes that access to loans is important for her business. She is requesting $1,200 to increase her clothing inventory. A good array of child-oriented products will help Tatyana better serve the needs of her clients and increase her sales. Additional income will allow her to invest more in her family\u2019s well-being and provide a better living for them which is her first priority in

They are a very close family. Pedro restores cars, repairing dents and repainting so that they are in optimal condition for the road. He learned this trade from a young age, but he left it for a while to run a telephone booth in his home. When his daughters began making crafts at home they had the idea to take over the management of the phone booth so that their father could return to working with cars and make more money. \r\n<p>\r\nFor Pedro, his work is more than a job, but an activity that he really enjoys. The work is not easy, as it demands a lot of physical exertion, but he is used to the effort. In the future, he would like to have his own auto body repair shop and devote himself completely to it.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Pedro's first loan from Microfinanzas PRISMA, and he promises to be punctual with his payments. He will use the money to purchase tools he needs to develop his business. He will also invest in his daughters' business by purchasing items they need to create their products (beads, string, wire, etc.).\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kris Vickery, Kiva

She is 46 years old and is married to a fisherman, Edgardo. She and her husband have three children: two in college and one in high school.\r\n\r\nFebelita and her husband come from very poor families. They realize that their lack of education has led to their poverty, and they want a better life for their children. The couple has a strong belief not to be affected by poverty; instead they are inspired to work hard for their children.\r\n\r\nFebelita joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap Inc.), a Kiva partner in the Philippines, in 1995; since then, she has grown to love the organization. ASHI helped her in the start-up of a business, enabling her to support her husband in their daily expenditures.\r\n\r\nFebelita and her husband have been in the fishing business for more than ten years. She now proposes that her eighth loan of Php 25,000 be used to continue their fishing business with the support of her husband. She will purchase assorted equipment for her fishing business like fishing net, rope, and bamboo. The remaining loan will be use to pay for a cow for additional income.\r\n\r\nFebelita hopes that this business will be the source of income to finance the needs of her family and to provide a comfortable house to live in. She is very thankful to all members of ASHI for educating her, especially in dealing with other people, generating an ability to accept new challenges in her life, and helping her to achieve her dreams and improve their standard of living.\r\n\r\nFebelita is grateful to the ASHI-Kiva partnership for supporting people like her who want to get out of poverty and get ahead. She hopes that the partnership continues this way for a long time and helps many poor families.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":475238,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fishing","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

There, she raised her family together with her husband of 27 years, Ignacio.  They had 3 children, who they raised and educated with love and great care.  Now they live alone in their own home.  By working arduously, Melania has been successful in improving her fields.  Every morning, she gets up very early to water her plantings and to offer the same care to her coffee plants and her banana plants.  She sells her fruits in the city of La Merced, which is where she gets the best prices for her products.  What she likes best about her work is that she can enjoy the freedom of working in her fields.  She has been doing this for 30 years and considers that the most difficult part is having to work the soil.  But she sees that she is compensated for her sacrifice when she is able to sell to the wholesalers who frequently visit the area, and from whom she receives good earnings.  She is currently in the midst of the coffee harvest, and she is sure that she will obtain the results she was hoping for.  In addition, she has the support of her husband, who sells fish door-to-door in the settlements in their area.  In time, she hopes to be able to improve her fields so she can plant a lot more coffee.  Melania belongs to the communal bank \u201cAroma de Caf\u00e9\u201d (Coffee Aroma), and this is her fourth loan with MFP, where she hopes for a small loan to achieve her goals.

She lives happily with her husband, Carlos, 64, and their children Mercedes, 31, and Daisy, 27.  They live in a pleasant home which they own and have invested heavily in to insure its good construction.  She prepares all kinds of cakes.  To do so, she equipped part of her house and there produces the most varied flavores of desserts:  turnovers and cakes, among others, which emit a provocative and pleasant aroma capable of convincing the most demanding customer.  She has sweetened tastes for over 20 years, a task she learned in pastry school and, ever so often, through courses she takes in order, as she herself states: \"to be refreshed and up-to-date because everything changes, even cakes.\"  In the beginning, Julia sold to her family and acquaintances but now she sells to many strangers who come to her home anxious to buy from her.  The person writing this account can attest to the delicious delicacies this sweet woman prepares.  This is how this hard-working woman injects herself into each preparation, mixes various select ingredients, and obtains each day the best in each cake.  This is the fifth loan with MFP and she is sure to repay in a timely fashion as she has always done in the past.  The funds requested will be used to buy a greater quantity of ingredients and to innovate some of the types of pastries because she wants to modernize the tools she uses to be able to offer still better desserts.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":420779,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":" To buy ingredients and utensiles for dessert preparation.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-05T19:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:57Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843157},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-23T12:26:09Z","rounded_local_amount":507.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734737},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:15Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959802},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:08Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992647},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:50Z","rounded_local_amount":253.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717432}],"funded_date":"2009-11-06T03:06:21Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":154167,"name":"Kroem","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Kroem K. lives in Tuol Trea village in Takeo province.

She is well known in the Brazilian community and has a good client base. Her son speaks English very well and has helped her improve her business. He assisted her in working with ACCION USA to get a loan.\r\n\r\nThis will be Joselita\u2019s third loan with ACCION USA. Her previous two loans had an almost perfect repayment history. She qualified for her third loan to buy more inventory for the summer and refinance her previous loan. Her store mainly sells dresses, shirts, jeans, shoes and perfumes. Joselita hopes that during the summer months her sales will increase and she wants to have enough products to meet the demand. Her busiest months have always been during the summer and around the holidays. \r\n\r\nACCION USA\u2019s loans have helped Joselita tremendously in growing her business. Since her first loan in 2007, Joselita has consistently expanded her inventory and clientele. She has always imported most of her products directly from Brazil, which is very appealing to her customers. \r\n\r\n<b>About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild the economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and proviD. employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.

Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.

Ya cancel\u00f3 su anterior Credikiva con gran puntualidad gracias al cual logr\u00f3 aumentar sus ventas, sus utilidades y mejorar las condiciones de su vivienda en lo que se refiere a pisos, pa\u00f1etes y techo. Con el actual pr\u00e9stamo planea comprar cuero, hilos, herrajes y accesorios.

Ya est\u00e1 ahorrando para lograr esa meta. El se\u00f1or Lenin le manda un saludo muy especial a todos sus financiadores de Kiva, dese\u00e1ndoles que tengan un feliz a\u00f1o 2011, pleno de abundancia, mucha salud y prosperidad en compa\u00f1\u00eda de todos sus  familiares.

Jim\u00e9nez makes leather straps, billfolds, purses and handbags in his workshop located in his house in Barranquilla.  His sales location is in the outskirts of the Metrocentro commercial center to the south of the city.  He paid off his previous Kiva loan with excellent punctuality thanks to which he was able to increase his sales and profits, and improve the condition of his home (flooring, plasterwork, and ceiling).  With this current loan he plans to purchase leather, threads, hardware, and accessories.  In the near future he hopes to buy a modern stamping machine so he no longer has to pay for this service, to give his products a better finish.  He is already saving to accomplish this goal.  \r\n\r\nSe\u00f1or Lenin sends a special greeting to all his Kiva lenders, wishing them and their families a happy new year for 2011 full of abundance, health and prosperity.

She earns her living by operating a general store and a fish vending business. Her husband Alejandro, who is 50 years old, works as a fish vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have nine children who are between 8 and 27 years old. Jenelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jenelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000 to use as funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and family. Jenelyn is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

C. de Lozano is 70 years old, and lives in Ayacucho, Peru. She owns a small corner shop next to her home, and sells \u201cbebidas,\u201d or drinks, such as soda pop, beer, and bottled water. She established her business 27 years ago, to supplement her husband\u2019s income. Her clients consist of people in her neighborhood, who know her as a reliable source for their beverages. <p>\r\n\r\nWhile she runs a successful business now, life has not been easy for Celia. She and her husband had 11 children, 3 of whom died. Furthermore, 21 years ago, her husband abandoned her for another woman, and Celia had to support her 8 remaining children by herself. <p>\r\n\r\nCelia\u00b4s first loan was for US $50, which she paid back $5 a week. This small amount allowed her to expand her product line, and now, in addition to drinks, she is able to sell candles for church service on Fridays and Sundays. She says that saving money informally in her house is very difficult, but in her Village Bank, Celia has established a savings account where she feels her money is safe.
