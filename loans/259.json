In their loan application, the group described their business as follows:<p>\r\n\r\n\u201cBackground:  The 'balayeuses' or sweepers number 65 members and are divided into four smaller groups.  They often suffer from the lack of financial resources.  The sweepers take charge of improving living conditions by regularly sweeping the streets and main boulevard of their neighborhood, because the local government does not provide garbage collection services. With time, this citizen practice of taking responsibility for improving local living conditions has spread like an oil stain to the surrounding localities.<p>\r\n\r\nObjective:  To support these women in their retail trading activities.  <p>\r\n\r\nSpecific objective:  To provide the members of this group with the resources they need to strengthen their trading activities, allowing them to continue their neighborhood cleaning services as well.<p>\r\n\r\nBrief description of the activities to be financed by the loan:  The members of this group engage in retail sale of all types of common consumption items [i.e. food products, clothing, etc.].  With the loan funds, the group will buy such products in bulk and resell them among the members of their association and to other customers, and the profits earned from all these transactions will be used to repay the loan and to reinforce the purchasing power of the group.\u201d <p>\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n<p>\r\nSenegal is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, yet its solid democratic tradition and highly developed associational life distinguish it from other countries in its income group. Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n<p>\r\nOriginal French business description:<p>\r\n\r\n\u00ab Contexte du projet :Les balayeuses sont au  nombre de 65 membres reparties dans quatre petits groupement, elles souffrent le plus souvent de la raret\u00e9 des ressources financi\u00e8res.

After joining the Fund, she has boldly borrowed money to invest in doing business.  Being a quick-minded, smart woman, she easily familiarized herself with the details of business and trading.  To date, she has become a woman who is very experienced with dealing in agricultural products.  This business helped the family\u2019s finances become more stable.  Besides this business, she also worked with her son and daughter-in-law to raise chickens and fish.  The family\u2019s quality of life is getting better day by day.  In this round of funding she is requesting 10,000,000 VND to invest in her business.

He hopes that his business will continue to churn out a high quality product.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":381445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Operating capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-09-02T05:20:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis Joaquin ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-09-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:54:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1024.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87036152},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:36:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1024.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948561},{"amount":0.51,"local_amount":10.11,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":10.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790564},{"amount":50.26,"local_amount":1005.22,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:33:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1030.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790565},{"amount":49.86,"local_amount":997.22,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:33:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1021.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110681136},{"amount":49.37,"local_amount":987.45,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1011.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075666},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1024.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911684}],"funded_date":"2009-09-02T08:02:05Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":138060,"name":"Sam Try Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hawa B.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Ramzi wants to purchase a new rickshaw in order to work extra hours and increase the family income, but the amount of money he has isn't sufficient. He is therefore requesting a loan from FATEN, to be repaid monthly which, when combined with his savings, will enable Ramzi to make the purchase and help  him to improve his family's living conditions. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout This Loan Product:<p>\r\n\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan. <p>\r\n\r\nFor more information on lending in the Muslim world, please visit Kiva's Muslim World Lending helptext: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3aekx8m.\r\n

R.E.C. Primary School Waterloo was founded in 1926 by the government. R.E.C Waterloo has a total number of 546 pupils and a total number of fourteen staff. \r\n\r\nSince 2006, when Nafisatu A. T. took over the administration of the school, R.E.C Primary School Waterloo has been producing good results at the National Primary School Exams (NPSE). However, like many schools in Sierra Leone, REC Waterloo lacks adequate classrooms, seating accommodations and adequate learning and teaching materials.\r\n\r\nThis will be the first loan for teachers of the R.E.C Primary School from SMT\/Kiva. Government salaries are usually quite small for teachers, thus making teaching an unattractive profession for many whose primary motivator is money. Many choose other jobs over teaching because of the small salary, thus starving the field of qualified personnel to teach the children. The few who remain in the classrooms have to find other ways of making ends meet. The vast majority of them engage in either businesses or agriculture or they provide extra tutorial classes for the children (although this is a practice the government is trying to stop).\r\n<p>\r\nNeedless to say, loans from SMT are a great help to the teachers in order to boost their businesses or investing it in something productive. Many want to go to school but could not afford the cost. Some will want to buy pieces of furniture, but their monthly salary is not enough to let them do so. With a loan, they will be able to meet some of these needs.  And with their monthly salaries, they can repay easily via a payroll deduction type of system.\r\n\r\nNafisatu A. T. (left) is the head teacher of R.E.C Primary School Waterloo. She was born in Matotoka village, Tonkolili district, northern Sierra Leone.  She is fifty-four years of age and married with four children. One is already an adult and three are still attending schools. She has been a teacher for thirty-six years now. Nafisatu will use this loan to buy bundles of corrugated iron zinc to roof her house.  She does not expect to complete the roofing of her house with this loan, but with subsequent loans, however, she will certainly complete the roofing of her house.

Ulmasoy is 40 years old, widowed and has three children. The difficult circumstances and hardships in her life made her recognize the value of work from a very young age. For about seven years she has been buying young sheep and calves in the local market, fattening and selling them. Ulmasoy is a very hardworking woman, and her diligence is incredible. She works with strength worthy of immense admiration. She has always looked for a way to be an important protagonist by providing extra income in her home. Ulmasoy wakes up early every morning to feed her cows and bulls, with the goal of fattening them and selling them at the best price in the local market. She started this occupation because of the recommendation and teaching of her beloved mother. Thanks to this activity she is helping to provide her children with an education. Ulmasoy wants to keep educating them because she hopes that they\u2019ll reach the goals that they have laid out for themselves. For this purpose, she is requesting a loan of 6,000 TJS to buy calves in order to expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He lives with his common-law wife, Elena, 39 years old. From their relationship they have 2 children, Judith, 15, and Antony, 6. They all live together in a house which they own. Luis started his adventure as an agriculturist when he was a young boy, working on his parents' land. His passion for agriculture brought him to acquire his own land and today he has worked independently for 18 years. He cultivates coffee and cocoa on the 10 hectares of land that he has. During the harvest season he hires farmhands to help him harvest the product quicker. This way he manages to complete his work at a greater pace. He is very committed to his business. And it is thanks to this business that today he enjoys watching his plants yield better products, earning better profits for each kilogram that he sells. When the winter season arrives he must take care to avoid insects from harming his plantations. The constant rain also impedes his work. This is his 12th loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and he is ready to make his payments on time as he wishes to access future loans. With the loan that he requests he will purchase fertilizer for his land."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":760450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fertilizers for his land.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-29T16:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luis ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1060.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385301}],"funded_date":"2011-04-30T08:55:43Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":298688,"name":"Livingstone","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Livingstone is 30 years old.

They have since divorced. <p>\r\n\r\nWith the requested loan of $300, she plans to increase her stock of assorted household items. Mirriam's business even takes her to the neighbouring country of Uganda. She sells household goods such as blankets, cooking pans, detergents, etc. at reasonable prices from Kenya.<p>\r\n\r\nMiriam depends on her business for her livelihood and to educate her daughters and pay for their general living expenses. She is an optimist and believes in what she is doing. She looks forward to opening a shop in Mbale, Uganda one day. <P>\r\n\r\nMirriam's hard work is an inspiration for others in her community. It's amazing the amount of goods she and other vendors are able to carry and the long distances they travel. One can only admire their determination to fight on and overcome poverty.

Sutarma serves each customer who comes around, and services their equipment, and on top of that Sutarma himself also immediately begins work on each order.  This business was pioneered four years ago with Rp. 1,700,000, which went towards used carbide welding equipment.  Now it has grown into a busy shop with many orders.  Moreover, now it has been completed with an electric welding machine which was purchased with money made possible through a loan of Rp. 2,000,000.  With the business Sutarma now runs he can take in Rp. 400,000 a day with a profit of Rp. 150,000 a day. Sutarma uses this income to fund his kids who are still in primary school.  Sutarma feels proud to own this business because in addition to earning a living, the man from Nengah Purwani can also contribute to the economy for the people in the area.    \r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Indonesian by Andrew Goss, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nI Nyoman Sutarma  memiliki usaha yaitu bengkel las  dengan satu (1) orang tenaga kerja yang digaji dengan sistem kontrak \/ prosentase. Sutarma bisa melayani setiap pelanggan yang datang memesan ataupun menservice barangnya. bahkan Sutarma sendiri juga ikut terjun langsung mengerjakan setiap pesanan yang ada. Usaha ini dirintisnya sejak 4 tahun yang lalu dengan modal Rp. 1.700.000.- yang berupa alat  las karbit bekas (second). Kini sudah berkembang menjadi bengkel yang ramai dan banyak pesanan . Apalagi sekarang sudah dilengkapi dengan mesin las listrik yang di belinya dengan menggunakan uang pinjaman dari Dinari Rp 2.000.000 . Dengan usaha yang dimiliki sekarang  Sutarma bisa berproduksi Rp 400.000\/hari dan keuntungan bersih  yang di dapat Rp 150.000\/hari . Hasil inilah yang Sutarma pergunakan untuk membiayai seorang anaknya yang masih duduk di bangku sekolah menengah pertama             ( SMP ). Sutarma merasa bangga memiliki usaha ini karena selain mendapatkan hasil tambahan , suami dari Nengah Purwani ini juga bisa menciptakan lapangan kerja bagi masyarakat sekitarnya ."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":68913,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a dynamo to increase repair capacity and complete orders in a more timely fashion -

name since it was most important that she work in the field.  She has four children who depend upon her.  Carmen was born in San Ignacio, in the province of Cajamarca, and she lived with only her father and brothers because her mother abandoned the family when Carmen was a child. (It is only within the past five years that she has met her mother). <p>\r\nAt the age of 14 Carmen fled from her house with some friends because her father was abusing her.  She came to Trujillo to work as a maid, and at 16 became pregnant and had to leave her job (she has since married the child\u2019s father).  She then dedicated herself to washing clothes and later her sister-in-law gave her the idea of selling candy, and that\u2019s how she started in this activity. <p>\r\nCurrently she lives in the settlement \u201cRam\u00f3n Castilla\u201d of the district Huanchaco in Trujillo and she works selling candy during the school year at the entrance to a school located in the center of the city of Trujillo.  During vacations and on the weekends she sells candy in the Plaza de Armas and also at the hotsprings of Huanchaco. <p>\r\nShe obtained her first loan of S\/300 (approximately $100) as part of the group Mientras Tanto \u201cSol Radiante\u201d with which she purchased candy in order to stock her cart.  Recently she has requested a loan from Manuela Ramos for S\/700.00 (approximately $234) to be paid back in four months, with which she will buy some soft drinks and toys which she plans to sell during Christmas Vacation.  Carmen Rosa dreams of having a stable business in a mall or market in order to not have to walk around selling her goods.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Debra Faszer-McMahon, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Carmen Rosa tiene 41 a\u00f1os de edad, estudi\u00f3 solo hasta cuarto grado de primaria porque su padre consider\u00f3 que era suficiente con que sepa escribir su nombre y que era m\u00e1s importante el trabajo en la chacra; tiene 4 hijos y todos dependen de ella.

(Greetings!) from Tanzania! Pictured here is 27 year-old Veronica M. from Mwanza. She is married with two children who are between the ages of one and four. Additionally, she is is mother to one orphan.\r\n\r\nVeronica has been running a tailoring business since 2006. She sells clothes mainly for women. She works at the business for 12 hours per day, five days per week and is assisted by her husband. Veronica currently earns about 100 USD a month from her business. \r\n\r\nNow, she is requesting a loan of 400 USD in order to purchase vitambaa (material), vitenge (a traditional Tanzanian cloth with wax print) and kanga (printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides). She plans to use these materials to design clothing mainly for women. In the future, she plans to increase her stocks. Veronica thanks you for her support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":271108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchases vitambaa (material), vitenge (a traditional Tanzanian cloth with wax print), and kanga (printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides) to make them into women's clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-15T02:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:16Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130778},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:24Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027567},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613568},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:46Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010647},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232933},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:28Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664726},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105450},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:49Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022595},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867844},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52400,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757045}],"funded_date":"2009-02-15T04:22:01Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Chang","image":null}},{"id":92985,"name":"Marbell Petrona","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La joven Marbel tiene 24 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en el barrio Memorial Sandino en la ciudad de Managua, tiene una ni\u00f1a de 2 a\u00f1os y su esposo  trabaja en un restaurante en servicios de vigilancia.

She is 57 years old. Teotima is married and has four adult children. To make a living, Teotima owns & operates a business raising pigs for sale. Teotima has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Teotima joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teotima has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Teotima chose to request a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase baby pigs to raise & sell in the future. This loan will be the eighth loan taken out by Teotima from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family income. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

is a very hard-working woman who undertakes the hard manual labour of the fields.  Year after year she worked as a day-labourer on other people\u2019s lands:  often they didn\u2019t recognise the tremendous effort she made with the meagre pay they gave her.  Because of this, five years ago Maria decided to dedicate herself entirely to the wholesale retail of carrots:  she also sells alfalfa occasionally.  Maria\u2019s work consists of going to the cultivation fields at the time of the carrot harvest:  after the washing process she selects them, packages them and then sells them wholesale in the wholesale market in Huancayo.  In this way Maria is an important economic provider in her household, above all for her three children who are still studying.  Maria\u2019s wish is to obtain a loan in order to buy a larger quantity of carrots and thus increase her profits.  If previously unkind people have taken advantage of Maria\u2019s neediness, she has now learnt that with continued efforts it is possible to advance her family\u2019s well-being by herself.  Your help will be very valuable in her life, and something that she will never forget.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from the Spanish by Katy Long, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><\/p>\r\n<p>Mar\u00eda es una mujer muy trabajadora dedicada a las duras tareas del campo, a\u00f1o tras a\u00f1o trabaj\u00f3 como pe\u00f3n en otras tierras, muchas veces no compensaba el tremendo esfuerzo que hac\u00eda con el pago que le daban.

Her average monthly income is about 6,000 Grivnas. <p>\r\n\r\nErika is very inventive. She manages to keep her business running smoothly even amidst the worst economic conditions. She balances reasonable prices, despite rate increases, and a variety of inventory that she offers for sale in her kiosk. Erika is requesting a loan of 5,000 Grivnas to increase her turnover capital. She believes that having this additional capital will help her minimize her sales risk and provide further stable financial support for her family.

Pero sus deseos de crecer permanecen en ella, y con algo de dinero ahorrado logr\u00f3 comprar un carrito para de comida con el cual sale todas las noches a la puerta de su casa para ofrecer diversos aperitivos a los transe\u00fantes, ya que tiene el beneficio de estar situada en un lugar de gran afluencia de personas. A pesar de atender s\u00f3lo por las noches, no deja de ser fatigada su labor, pues durante el d\u00eda tiene que realizar los diversos platillos y ensaladas que sus clientes est\u00e1n acostumbrados a consumir.

She lives with them in the house that she and her husband worked very hard together to obtain.  Her desire to progress led her to multiple activities.  These activities paid for her children\u2019s education.  The children are now professionals, and this fills her with satisfaction.  \r\n\r\nBut, her desire to grow remains.  With some saved money she was able to buy a food cart, which she takes to the front of her house every night.  She sells different snacks to the passers-by.  She has the benefit of being located in a place where there are a lot of people.  \r\n\r\nIn spite of tending her cart just in the evenings, she is still tired from her work.  During the day she makes different dishes and salads that her customers are used to eating.  All of this work has an end, which is to have a restaurant in her home.

She will use this new Kiva loan partly to buy materials and supplies for her purses because she has pending orders all the way from the city of Valledupar in Cesar Department that she must fill promptly to keep her customers because they are her best spokespeople and are aware of the quality of her work.  She wants to use the other part of it to service her sewing machines leaving them like new and ready to increase production.\r\n\r\nThe good results Jaqueline\u2019s work has had are related to her history and creative potential.  Form a very young age she was interested in dress designing.  Because of this she\u2019s taken courses through SENA to improve the handicraft techniques she had learned from family and neighbors always expanding her creativity in designing each item she makes.\r\n\r\nThis business helps her contribute to household expenses while her husband works as a high school teacher providing Jaqueline with all the support she needs to stay excited about earning income through doing the work she most enjoys: crafts.\r\n\r\nHer greatest challenges are to have a larger firm, to expand her market share and to own her own house.  While this happens, she continues striving to earn higher profits on her sales which currently are no less than 26%.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":760516,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to

She is married to Benjam\u00edn, with whom she has had three children: Alisvediana, 16, and Fernando, 15, live with them but support themselves, while Daniela, 9, is still under Medida's care. Medida has worked with other loans and this is the first one she is requesting through the foundation, and it's to purchase cattle to later resell in the area. This is her first time doing this activity, and she hopes to have good results and have money for her household. Her husband inspired her to do this activity since he is working outside of the country and he doesn't want what he makes invested poorly in another activity without good results, so she decided to buy and sell livestock since it's the only one that will give her good earnings. Her biggest goal is that with chickens and this activity she can make headway and, with the help of her husband, she can grow her business day by day and make progress for her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":791180,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy and sell cattle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COPAINAL\u00c1, CHIAPAS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-06-16T02:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Anonymous","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2000},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":144.61,"local_amount":1713.95,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1721.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223420},{"amount":192.89,"local_amount":2286.05,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2296.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201697},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2009.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807287},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2009.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618412}],"funded_date":"2011-06-16T14:57:12Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":311012,"name":"Kimleang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kimleang, 48 years old, is a farmer.

is a 37 year old widower with four children living in the Kibera slums of Nairobi. Having not completed his secondary school education, Franklin decided to come to Nairobi from his home in the Kisii district to try his luck in the capital city. \r\n\r\nFortunately, he had a cousin who owned a metal workshop.  He was able to assist with tasks at the workshop which gave him work exposure. After about 6 months he left and was employed at a firm named  Joaki Enterprises within the city. That was in 2000. Franklin was lucky and got a contract to make windows and doors for Ksh 17,000 (USD 243). With this kind of money, he decided that it was time to be on his own. Through his savings and the money he earned from the contract, Franklin started his own workshop in September 2005. Since then the business has been doing well and has enabled him to put his eldest daughter into a boarding school in Kakamega, the western part of Kenya.\r\n                                    \r\nThe only impediment to Franklin\u2019s business is that he doesn\u2019t have a grinder and drilling machine. Quite often he borrows from neighboring workshops, which are sometimes not willing to loan their equipment. Time and money is wasted negotiating for the equipment. Lately he has been losing business due to the lack of machines. \r\n\r\nTherefore Franklin is kindly asking for a loan of USD 200 to enable him to purchase the grinder and drilling machines. The new additions to his business will allow him do his work quickly and efficiently. This will bring back his clients and he will get contracts to make windows, doors and other welding related work. Franklin sees this as a way of creating job opportunities and intends to employ two more people to help him at the workshop.  This is because he envisions that he will have more work from additional contracts.  The repayment period for the loan is 8-15 months.        \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":21333,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a grinder and drilling machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kibera Slums, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-03-27T20:40:00Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Franklin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-10T21:07:23Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-05-27T09:17:41Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-30T03:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":17715},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-06-27T09:17:58Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-30T03:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26536},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-07-27T09:20:44Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-30T03:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36041},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-08-27T09:22:44Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-30T03:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47073},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-09-27T09:23:15Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-30T03:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59371},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-10-27T09:25:14Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-30T03:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":72745},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-27T10:26:09Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-30T03:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87511},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-30T03:38:09Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103626}],"funded_date":"2007-03-27T21:07:23Z","paid_date":"2007-12-27T10:18:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11073,"name":"Kung","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kung Y. is 42 years old and lives with her husband and four children in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so she can use it while in process of paying back her loan \u00d0 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":201070,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stock of medicine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-09-15T18:20:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rabia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-29T22:05:54Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-10-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":374492},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-11-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:19:05Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347979},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970553},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-01-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:16:55Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886770},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436030},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130303},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:58Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027134},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:36Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613174},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010257},{"amount":45,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:06Z","rounded_local_amount":51771.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232568}],"funded_date":"2008-09-15T22:05:54Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:40:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Brooks","image":643421}},{"id":68439,"name":"Thi Hang","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Ch\u1ecb H\u00e0 Th\u1ecb H\u1eb1ng 44 tu\u1ed5i, ch\u1ecb tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 n\u0103m 1997.

","en":"Rosalinda is a 36-year-old woman characterized by the dedication that she offers to her loved ones, from her husband to her 3 sons, for whom she sacrificed together with her husband in order to provide them with a house of their own to live in.  During many years she worked at a business away from her home, but the necessity to be with her young children led her to search for an activity that gives her the opportunity to work at home.  Thanks to a neighbor she has found work making women's earrings, which she does all day in her house.  \r\nSince she now has the materials and tools she needs to make the various designs that are requested from her by her customers, she keeps herself open to customers' orders 8 hours a day, trying to make sure that she carries out her work efficiently and fulfills her customers' expectations. With the skills that she has developed, she creates new designs to impress and please her customers in hope of selling a greater amount and by doing so increasing her income.  \r\nRosalinda also wants to install a grocery store in her house, since all the other grocery stores in the region are far away.  She is in her thirteenth loan with MFP.  Her experience with the group has motivated her to continue working as a team, since each of her partners tries to maintain harmony in the group, helps the other partners when they are faced with difficult circumstances, and is very smart and careful in evaluating new people who wish to join the communal bank that they all worked so hard to create.  With the 2500 soles that she requests, Rosalinda will purchase new materials and tools with which she will be able to make her earrings with even greater results. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Lenhart, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":321773,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Compra de materiales para la elaboraci\u00f3n de aretes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-21T22:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":380.02},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":386.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":406.87},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":423.15},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":441.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":462.26}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.41},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.46},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.27},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":139.64},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.68},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125.41,"local_amount":380.02,"processed_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:56:30Z","rounded_local_amount":381.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596294},{"amount":127.46,"local_amount":386.25,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:49Z","rounded_local_amount":388.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990574},{"amount":134.27,"local_amount":406.87,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:41Z","rounded_local_amount":408.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211685},{"amount":139.64,"local_amount":423.15,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":425.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641206},{"amount":145.68,"local_amount":441.45,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:38:55Z","rounded_local_amount":443.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080646},{"amount":152.54,"local_amount":462.26,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:13:00Z","rounded_local_amount":464.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996771}],"funded_date":"2009-05-22T01:31:58Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T03:13:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Lenhart","image":null}},{"id":113497,"name":"Nazakat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"K.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns a monthly income of 12.000,00MT.\r\nShe has never had a loan with another lending institution, and she learned about Hluvuku-Adsema from friends.  She is asking for a loan of 20.000,00MT to buy more clothing to sell.\r\nRegina would like to improve her business and gain more clients (for example she would like to offer a system of credit and monthly payments for her clients).  She pledges to repay her loan in order to continue working with lending institutions, so she can realize her dreams.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Rachel Crouch, Kiva

Since he has not had any type of formal education at the beginning of his career, he has started to study the career of journalism by correspondence.\r\n\r\nGerman is very hard working and is getting ahead for his family with a great effort. Before beginning to work as an announcer he made his living as a moto taxi driver. Now he continues to work using his vehicle during his free time.\r\n\r\nThe income that he receives allows him to maintain his family and build his house little by little.

Together they have two children, Pamela, 10 and Jeison, 9.  The family lives in a cozy house which they rent, located in the lower sierras of Peru.   From the time they were very young, Elvis and Flora learned about agriculture, but they never grew crops for a living until about 10 years ago when they formally began to grow potatoes, carrots and other crops, including flowers, on the land of their ancestors.   Together with the crops, they also raise animals such as donkeys, which are indespensable for transporting their products.   What they like most about their work is the cultivation of potatoes.   Elvis and Flora feel their business is viable, as it allows them to take care of the family, as well as save a little money to buy 3 plots of fertile land which they can plant this season.   This is why they are happy and motivated to be growing the business.   In the future, they would like to be able to buy sheep, pigs and cows, as well as plant in greater quantity. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p> This is their 3rd loan with MFP.   Their fellow members in the communal bank know Elvis and Flora as being honest and punctual, and an example of hardwork every day.

She and her husband work together to raised their big family. They are currently living at Taghangin, Morong Rizal, Philippines. She is also a woman of good faith to conquer all challenges to achieve family dreams. \r\n\r\nNenita\u2019s main goal is to build a sustainable business to meet the needs of her seven children; she was thus encouraged to join ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, in 2004. The previous loans she received from ASHI were carefully invested in her variety store. Since then, the business has been performing well and earning her sufficient profit. She is grateful that she has been able to educate her children using proceeds from her business as she continues to expand. Nenita needs a loan to help boost her business for increased profit making.\r\n\r\nShe runs a variety store. She started her variety store through her initiative of dealing with customers. She wants to continue her business. She is requesting a loan of PHP 25,000 to use for additional capital to improve her business and her income. Specifically, the money will use to purchase five sacks of rice, charcoal, sugar, canned goods, cigarettes, fabric conditioner, and other inventory for her variety store. \r\n\r\nShe dreams of growing her variety store into a mini-grocery store and expanding it to another village. Her seven children are her inspiration to pursue her variety store. She now feels very happy with the service of ASHI and KIVA. It gives them a big chance to pursue their family dreams. She hopes that they continue the service for a long time and help many families who want to get ahead.\r\n\r\nAbout ASHI: Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI) has the distinction of being the oldest existing replication of the Grameen Bank Approach (GBA) to credit delivery to the bottom poor in the Philippines. With its outstanding achievements over the years, it has become one of the role models in credit delivery to the poor in the

He lives in his own house with his family and supports two brothers who live with him.\r\n\r\nJoaquim left Manhi\u00e7a to move to Boane District with his parents when he was very young.  For more than two years he has had his own shoe resale business.  He also builds brick houses.  He has one employee who helps him with his work, and he earns about 9,000 meticais per month, which he uses for household expenses and still manages to save some money through Xitique (a traditional system of rotating savings).\r\n\r\nHe has never had loans from other banks.  Joaquim learned about Hluvuku through his mother, who is also a customer of this institution.  This is his first loan.  He is asking for 9,000 meticias to buy pairs of shoes so he can increase his inventory.\r\n\r\nHe promises to pay off this loan on time so he will be able to take out more loans.  In the future, he intends to ask for more loans to use in his business, and one of his dreams is to have a nice shop.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Danielle Maxson, Kiva

He is a widower, and since then has shared his life with his 2 beloved children in their own home.\r\nHe cultivates bananas and coffee. With his vast lands he has become one of the main producers in the area. He brings his produce to the city of La Merced, where he already has customers waiting for him, since he always offers produce of very high quality. What he most likes about his job is harvesting the coffee, which he does with much effort. He has been doing this for 30 years and considers the most difficult part to be keeping his crops safe from the pests that can affect them. In the future, he wants to buy a car, with which he will be able to transport his products. This is his second loan with MFP, and he is prepared to pay his quotas punctually and he has already started to save up. In his community group he is a very happy member and is always very aware of the agreements he has with his peers.

After several years of apprenticeship along side her mother, Fatoumata was able to master trading on a small scale. Later, she developed her own wings and was able to carry out the same activity as her mother. She has been selling clothes, blankets, sheets and shoes for fifteen years and has a strong reputation in the neighborhood. With the goal of increasing her working capital, in order to make more profit, Fatoumata has turned to Soro Yiriwaso. This is her first individual loan, and she plans to use it to buy 5 blankets and 5 pieces of embroidered \"pagne\" (printed cotton fabric).\r\n\r\nFatoumata obtains her supplies from wholesalers in Bamako, then she sells for cash and on credit to customers who are, for the most part, women. With this loan, she plans to make a monthly profit of 60,000 CFA. This will enable her to help her husband and to participate in social events (baptisms, weddings, etc.).

She is 45 years old. Marifel is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Marifel owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop.

Marifel is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to buy and sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Marifel from HSPFI.

Nevertheless, Venus plans to resolve this issue and come up with a bigger, better store \u2013 not just to serve her community, but to help her family as well.

She earns her living by operating a business selling fish. Her husband Arnie, who is 39 years old, works as a plumber to earn his living.  They have three children who are 2 to 13 years old. Georgette joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Georgette has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 30,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000. She intends to use the loan to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for children's education and family needs. Georgette is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

The funds will be used to pay the loan interest, provide for the needs of the extended family, and to invest the rest in the businesses.  Their ambition is to diversify their commerce by embracing other income-generating work, such as opening a shop for ready-to-wear clothing. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":271199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy clothing and shoes for resale ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Assan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Djenebou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Niama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koro ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":750000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":null,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":93750},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":93750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.37},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.37},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.37},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.37},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.37},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.37},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.37},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":184.41}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":93033,"name":"La Union Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\u201cLa Union\u201d is a group of ten entrepreneurs seeking their third loan from Esperanza International.

Sara is the president of this group in the city of Santiago.  \r\n\r\nSara, mother of a two year old daughter, has used her past two Esperanza loans to fund her \u201ccolmado\u201d, or small grocery store.  With her first loan, Sara ran her own small colmado until a member of her microfinance bank became ill and could no longer run her colmado.  Sara merged the two colmados and with her second loan was able to fund the joint effort.  The previously ill member of the bank is now healthy and will be taking over the joint colmado and Sara will use her third loan to start a new business selling used clothing.  Sara is able to buy used clothing in bulk packages and sell to her neighbors and neighboring communities.  When asked about the dreams for her business and life, Sara declares that she intends to help those who are ill as she has in the past and to continue to provide a good life for her child.  \r\n\r\nOther members of Sara\u2019s microfinance bank run similar entrepreneurial activities including a beauty salon, cake sales, and a small restaurant.  \r\n\r\nOn behalf of Esperanza and this

Desde entonces empez\u00f3 a dedicar m\u00e1s tiempo a la elaboraci\u00f3n de esta prenda, ya que es m\u00e1s comercial. Durante el mes de marzo vienen de otras ciudades sus compradores, quienes se dedican a vender este tipo de tejidos a los turistas que visitan sus ciudades durante la semana santa. La idea de Valerio es producir de 5 a 6 docenas y luego viajar a esos lugares para vender a los turistas directamente, pero como sus pedidos se incrementan en esos meses le es imposible realizar el viaje, y cuando quiere tejer durante otros meses cercanos a esta fechas, no puede porque no cuenta con el capital suficiente. Pero, Valerio no se hecha para atr\u00e1s en esta meta y seguir\u00e1 produciendo para aumentar sus ganancias y poder viajar los siguientes a\u00f1os, por el momento seguir\u00e1 tejiendo y su esposa ofreciendo a sus dem\u00e1s clientes.

When he married, he learned to make tapestries and blankets and 3 years ago his brother-in-law taught him to make beautiful blankets with diverse colors and with thickness. Since then he started to spend more time making clothing, which is more commercial. During the month of March, his buyers, who sell these types of textiles to tourists during Holy Week, have come from other cities. Valerio's idea is to make 5 or 6 dozen and then travel to sell to the tourists directly, but his orders have increased recently and it is impossible to make the trip. When he wants to make textiles during other months close to holiday dates, he can't because he doesn't have sufficient capital. However, Valerio has not given up this goal and continues to producing in order to increase his earnings and have the ability to make the trip in the coming years. For the time being, he and his wife will continue to make textiles and offer them to other clientes. This is his first loan with MFP (field partner), he just became a member of the community bank, and he is very happy for the welcome that the other members gave him. He ahs also made a commitment to pay his share on time. The money he is asking for is for providing necessary material, such as processed wool and dying powders of the desired colors for the wool. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Caitlin Brooks, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":292706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buying materiales for making blankets","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-23T17:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Valerio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1008.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123942}],"funded_date":"2009-03-23T19:22:00Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Caitlin Brooks","image":263842}},{"id":101225,"name":"Yorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Yorn P., 50, is a widow with six children: three sons and three daughters.
