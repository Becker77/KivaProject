She is 45 years old and a single mother of six school-aged children. To make a living, Milagros owns and operates a business venture in the food sector in which she produces and sells food especially vegetables. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from ambulant vegetable vending. When afternoon comes, all her commodities are sold out. Milagros has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Milagros joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. As with her previous loan from ASKI which she has successfully repaid, this new loan of 11,000 PHP will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the fifth loan that Milagros has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is a woman who has always worked very hard, her entire life. She lives in her own home with her husband Narciso, age 45, and their three beloved children. They want to offer their children a better quality of life. Even as a teenager, Janeth worked on her parents' land and as a day labourer on various other farms. With the savings that she accumulated she purchased her own parcel of land where she has now been working for 23 years. She has 3 hectares of fertile land where she cultivates cocoa and coffee plants. The key to her success lies in her creativity and her desire to work. She uses modern technology on her farm, because she receives periodic training from agricultural engineers. Because of its quality and aroma, her coffee grain is in highest demand. She and her husband are always working, but during the harvest they hire day labourers; this allows them to extract and select their products more quickly.

While not her only means for generating revenue, her business is based primarily on planting and harvesting taro to sell. Faatafa has been engaged in this business for over six years and earns approximately 1400 WST per month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Faatafa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1950 WST from SPBD, which she used to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. Faatafa is now requesting a new loan of 2450 WST, which she will use to purchase land to expand her taro plantation. This will be her fourth loan from SPBD. Faatafa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":932667,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She owns 1.5 hectares of land (~3.7 acres), on which she grows rice to earn her living. Her husband, Mr. Kung Roem, is a construction worker who makes less than $2 to support his family. Mrs. Nheom S. is 53 years old and the mother of three children, one of whom is employed in a garment factory; the remaining two attend the local school. Although Mrs. Nheom S.'s family members have different businesses, they still live in an old house and in poor conditions. In order to improve her standard of living, Mrs. Nheom S. decided to ask for a loan. She will use the money, along with her savings to build a new house for her family. \r\n\r\nMr. Prum V. did not come to the meeting, so he is represented by his wife, who appears in the photo. Mrs. Ky Navy is the group guarantor. She is also shown in the picture. \r\n\r\nThis is a village bank loan which is paid in full at the end of its term.

R. and Katia R. P.. They are from Piedra Menuda, an area of Nindir\u00ed. This is a rural area that is difficult to access because transportation only goes there twice a day. \r\n\r\nThis group of women has already had two loans with Adim, with which they succeeded in increasing their raw materials and their clients. Because of this, they were able to assure that they are hard-working, enterprising, persevering, and have a great desire to overcome.\r\n\r\nThe group leader is Mrs. Benicia Murillo, who is 57 years old and is married to Mr. Antonia M., who is a farmer. They have three children. They live in a small house, which has the necessary amenities.\r\n\r\nEighteen years ago, Murillo decided to have a small business in her house because she needed a larger income. As a result, she decided to establish a small grocery store, which would allow her to take care of her daughter, who has Downs Syndrome.\r\n\r\nOver time, her grocery store has been growing little by little.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

G. works at the local gold mine during much of the year, but he also supplements his income by farming. In 2004, with the help of his mother, sister and brother-in-law, G. began planting vegetables on 0.2 hectares of land in the Bumbat of Ulziit soum. This year, he expanded his farmland to 1 hectare and hopes to continue growing in the future. Unfortunately, he won\u2019t be able to grow as large or as fast as he wants to because he doesn\u2019t have a storage building for his excess vegetables. Because of this problem, he is forced to sell some of the vegetables very cheaply and loses out on valuable profits.

She has been in this business for 25 years and believes that the most difficult part is the proper feeding of her cows, since anything undesirable that they eat could affect their milk production. Going forward, she hopes to increase the number of dairy cows that she has because she wants to increase their production.\r\n\r\nThis is Mercedes' first loan with MFP; she knows that she must pay on time and is prepared to do so. She is a very responsible member of her communal bank, always conscientious about making sure that agreements between members are fulfilled. With the nine hundred nuevos soles requested she will purchase more grass feed for her animals, because she knows that her business's success depends on their nutrition.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Amanda McDermott, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":451676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase feed for cows","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-19T02:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:06Z","rounded_local_amount":155.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734972},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":155.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124299},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":155.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960040},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:59Z","rounded_local_amount":155.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992885},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":155.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717672},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":155.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751358}],"funded_date":"2009-12-19T08:20:28Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":167491,"name":"Haim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Haim M. is 46 years of age, a rice farmer and a widower with a daughter.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Every day he wakes very early in the morning to irrigate and care for his banana and coffee plantations. He sells his harvest in the city of La Merced, location where he always gets the best revenues for his products. What he enjoys most about his work is being able to enjoy the freedom of working in his green fields. He has been an agriculturer for 30 years. The most difficult part about his work is the long hours of work, especially around this critical time of year when the harvest is in highest demand. This is the second loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner). He realizes that this loan will help him significantly in the progress of his business. He is committed to making his payments on time. As a member of his community group he is known to be very responsible and he is very well respected for this.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from tending a canteen near the school. Serna has been engaged in her business for more than four years and earns approximately 15,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Serna joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Serna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 40,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Serna is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the ninth loan taken out by Serna from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

She lives with her husband who works as a taxi driver. They have two children who are 11 and 12 years old. They live in the San Jose district, some 15 minutes from the province of Chiclayo, the capital of the Lambayeque region. This little community is primarily agricultural and livestock-raising. For 25 years, she has been making clothes from her home. She has a sewing machine. She offers a professional, high-quality service, and so she is well known in the area.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a hard-working woman who lives in her own house with her partner Ra\u00fal, 32, and their two dear children; Maida, who is nine, and Aurelio who is four. Their children are the reason for all their efforts. Rebeca is industrious, and every day she tries very hard to do her best for the members of her family. She is a farmer, and grows coffee and cacao. \r\n\r\nShe has been doing this work for five years, with great care and diligence. Thanks to the harvest that her crops provide, she bought another block of land in order to continue farming.  At harvest and at weeding time she has to hire day laborers, in order to get the planned work done more quickly. \r\n\r\nPart of her land is not cultivated, and inevitably, support from a financial institution is required to carry forward the work. She plans to sow her lands with more coffee plants, and for that reason applied for one of the loans that MFP makes available to low income people looking to progress in their lives.

A. was born in Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9 in 1980.  Lacking  money, she had to quit school in the 10th grade.  She then learned upholstery as a trade, that is, making drapes, cushions, and other furnishings.  This is her current craft.  She is married but without children.  Nevertheless, she is the guardian of her mother\u2019s orphaned niece.  Her husband is a taxi driver by profession.  But without a car, he currently drives a moped.  An energetic woman, Mrs. A. is an excellent upholsterer with a good command of her craft, but she lacks the funds for growing her business and augmenting her income.  She has to help with the household expenses, since her husband\u2019s income falls far short of covering them all.  For this reason, Dzifa is requesting a loan of $850 to buy the basic materials for her work.  She will then be able to help improve the daily life of her family.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nMadame A.

She would like a loan to purchase some materials for construction and to make repairs on some of her animal's cages. \r\n "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":24250,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Working capitol and materials to make repairs on her animal cages.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MD","country":"Moldova","town":"Pruteni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.502778 27.548889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":17,"posted_date":"2007-04-04T23:11:45Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Inna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-19T13:37:05Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2007-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2007-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2007-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2007-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2007-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2007-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2007-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":80}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":160,"local_amount":160,"processed_date":"2007-06-17T09:15:28Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23769},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-07-17T09:15:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":32914},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-08-17T09:16:25Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":43611},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-09-17T09:16:26Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":55584},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-10-17T09:16:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":68441},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-11-17T10:16:31Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":82565},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2007-12-17T10:16:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":98249},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2008-01-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":116931},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2008-02-17T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-02-18T10:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136909}],"funded_date":"2007-04-05T13:37:05Z","paid_date":"2008-02-17T10:16:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11544,"name":"Am\u00e9le","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Am\u00e9le A. was born in 1964 in Aklakou, where she still resides.

She is 48-years-old and lives with Elias, who is 56-years-old.  Together they have six children, and live with two of them in their own home.  For more than 30 years, she and her husband have grown crops such as avocadoes, plantains, pineapple, and coffee.  She really enjoys the tranquility of her farmhouse, but taking care of her crops can be very burdensome, since she has to weed her fields.  Together with her farming, she prepares a variety of dishes which she sells from her house, and in this way she generates additional income, along with what she earns farming.  Thanks to that income, she could buy her things, cover the educational costs of her children, and pay her household costs.  This is why she is thinking about finishing building her house and putting in a restaurant in the future, and she would also like to plant more coffee and plantains.  \r\n\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP, and she is very thankful for the trust that they continue to place in her.  This motivates her to continue working actively with her group.  With the loan she requests, she will buy bags of fertilizer, and also hire laborers who will help her maintain her crops, and she would also like ot buy some materials such as bamboo and nails to fix her house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shaun Haines, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":540286,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fertilizer, and hiring workers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-17T02:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Leonor ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":900}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":88.8,"local_amount":246.67,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:18Z","rounded_local_amount":251.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588909},{"amount":811.2,"local_amount":2253.33,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2300.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725535}],"funded_date":"2010-05-17T13:30:37Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shaun Haines","image":55908}},{"id":204958,"name":"Salorn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Salorn V. is a 30-year-old married woman who lives in Lvea Sa Kandal village in Kandal province.

He has been farming rice and raising cattle for about 50 years since he was young. He and his wife Germania have been living on this farm since they were married. They have raised their two kids and fed their family thanks to the fertility of their lands. Their children are all grown up now, but Audencio continues to cultivate rice in order to feed himself and provide additional support to his sons. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":24340,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Cultivate Rice on his farm","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-08T15:59:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Audencio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-23T16:08:17Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":925,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.14},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":132.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-05-07T14:02:02Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15384},{"amount":170,"local_amount":170,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T09:15:25Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":170,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21748},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T21:31:38Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29295},{"amount":637,"local_amount":637,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:15:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-10T23:27:54Z","rounded_local_amount":637,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65651}],"funded_date":"2007-04-09T16:08:17Z","paid_date":"2007-10-10T20:15:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11560,"name":"Guadalupe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Guadalupe is 38 years old and has two young daughters.

He started his business as a street vendor, but now his business is situated in his home in the city of Leon, specifically in the El Sauce village. <p> He is father to three children and his obligation is to provide them with an education they deserve. For this reason Gerardo sacrifices to sell his products and thus continue maintaining his modest family who depend greatly on him. It is necessary to emphasize that despite his modest living, which he has survived for some time now, he has been able to offer his children an education, nourishment, and a proud life. <p> At the moment, his home is in poor condition. The roof is bare, and he needs to invest in infrastructure desperately. For this reason CEPRODEL has disbursed immediate loans so that he may invest in his business. According to him, the loans have been incredibly helpful in improving his economic situation and in acquiring greater quantities of vegetables for sale. He has procured 5 loans from CEPRODEL, and at the moment he is urgently seeking to purchase vegetables and to improve his business. <p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p> \r\n<div align='justify'> \r\nEl  Se\u00f1or Gerardo S. se  dedica  a  la  actividad de venta de verduras el cual en un inicio ofertaba sus productos ambulantemente pero ahora se ubica en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n en la ciudad de Le\u00f3n espec\u00edficamente en el pueblo El Sauce. <p>\r\nEs padre de tres ni\u00f1as y su obligaci\u00f3n es brindarle la educaci\u00f3n que ellas se merecen. Por esta raz\u00f3n es que Gerardo se esfuerza para vender estos productos perecederos y as\u00ed continuar manteniendo su humilde familia que tanto necesita de el. Es necesario destacar que a pesar de la pobreza que este caballero ha tenido desde mucho tiempo atr\u00e1s ha logrado mantener a sus hijas brind\u00e1ndoles educaci\u00f3n, alimentaci\u00f3n y un techo digno.\r\n<p>\r\nActualmente  su  local  no posee buenas condiciones, el techo se encuentra descubierto y  por tanto necesita invertir en infraestructura. Es por tal razon que CEPRODEL le ha otorgado cr\u00e9ditos inmediatos para invertir en el negocio y seg\u00fan comenta, estos cr\u00e9ditos le han servido de mucho bien por el hecho de que ha mejorado su condici\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica y ha adquirido mayores cantidades de verduras para comercializarlas. Su record crediticio actualmente es de 5 cr\u00e9ditos con Ceprodel y su necesidad es la urgencia de compra de las verduras y de igual forma la mejora de su localidad.\r\n<\/div>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":128429,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2008-02-20T02:04:55Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gerardo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-03-05T02:54:43Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":18,"local_amount":308.57,"processed_date":"2008-04-05T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:10:30Z","rounded_local_amount":342.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":174559},{"amount":18,"local_amount":308.57,"processed_date":"2008-05-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:12:05Z","rounded_local_amount":342.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201791},{"amount":18,"local_amount":308.57,"processed_date":"2008-06-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:13:08Z","rounded_local_amount":342.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":229001},{"amount":18,"local_amount":308.57,"processed_date":"2008-07-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":342.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":258107},{"amount":18,"local_amount":308.57,"processed_date":"2008-08-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:15:34Z","rounded_local_amount":342.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":286843},{"amount":18,"local_amount":308.57,"processed_date":"2008-09-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-12T07:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":342.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":317095},{"amount":18,"local_amount":308.57,"processed_date":"2008-10-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-27T07:04:59Z","rounded_local_amount":342.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":348848},{"amount":14,"local_amount":240.01,"processed_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-15T23:40:25Z","rounded_local_amount":266.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5300394},{"amount":17.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T16:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":333.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9916608},{"amount":17.5,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T10:55:49Z","rounded_local_amount":333.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14841250}],"funded_date":"2008-02-20T02:54:43Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T10:55:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":40233,"name":"Fadi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The client, who has asked that his name not be released, is a 41-year-old man who lives in southern Lebanon.

Ii Group","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"The women that belong to the Bienaventuradas group have two characteristics that make one believe that they will do well with the loan that you\u2019re going to give them: assuredness and confidence in themselves and in their respective businesses which they stress to be so important. <p>\r\nThe disbursal took place in the garage of an old house.  An old pickup truck, on which the children were swinging, was parked inside.  The women were seated on typical plastic benches that they had just brought from the church.  All of the women are faithful followers of the churches within Santo Tom\u00e1s la Uni\u00f3n.<p>\r\nIn this group the majority of the women invest their loans in breeding animals and in the resale of both typical and American clothing.  You can also find some that invest the money in cases of thread to make beautiful, embroidered blouses that are typical in the region.  Others have convenience stores where they sell the products in high demand by the townspeople.  With their loan they buy beans, rice and soap along with various other products.<p>\r\nThe women think that working under the communal bank\u2019s methodology is very positive because, even though they live in the same community, they don\u2019t know each other that well.  Because of Friendship Bridge, they know many more women that live close by, but not only do they know them, they work together and cooperate with each other.  This creates an interpersonal bond that\u2019s very strong among the group members.  They also believe that due to the training and interaction, many women lose their shyness when speaking in public and their self esteem is raised.  By believing in these women, through Kiva, you are aiding in their development.  Keep doing it!<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Hugh Yarbrough, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>Las mujeres que pertenecen al grupo Bienaventuradas 2 tienen caracter\u00edsticas que a uno lo hacen confiar que a ellas les va a ir bien con el pr\u00e9stamo que se les va a otorgar. La seguridad y confianza en ellas mismas y sus respectivos negocios que ellas irradian es importante. \r\n\r\n<P>El desembolso se llevo acabo en el garaje de una casa antigua. Un pick-up viejo, en el cual los ni\u00f1os se estaban columpiando,  estaba estacionado dentro de \u00e9l. Las mujeres estaban sentadas en los t\u00edpicos banquitos de pl\u00e1stico que los acababan de traer de la iglesia. Todas ellas son fieles seguidoras de las iglesias dentro de Santo Tom\u00e1s la Uni\u00f3n. \r\n\r\n<P>En este grupo la mayor\u00eda de mujeres invierten su pr\u00e9stamo en la crianza de animales y reventa de ropa t\u00edpica y americana. Tambi\u00e9n se puede encontrar clientas que inviertan su pr\u00e9stamo en la compra de cajas de hilo para elaborar bellos bordados en las blusas t\u00edpicas. Otras tienen tiendas de conveniencia donde ellas venden los productos que son altamente demandados por las personas de la aldea. Con su pr\u00e9stamo ellas comprar fr\u00e9joles, arroz, jab\u00f3n, entre otros varios productos. \r\n\r\n<P>Las clientas piensan que trabajar bajo la metodolog\u00eda de bancos comunales es muy positivo ya que las mujeres, a pesar de que viven dentro de la misma comunidad, no se conocen bien. Consecuentemente, a trav\u00e9s de Friendship Bridge ellas conocen a muchas m\u00e1s mujeres que viven cerca de ellas, y no solo las conocen sino es que trabajan y cooperan seguido. Esto crea un lazo interpersonal muy fuerte entre las integrantes del grupo. Adem\u00e1s ellas creen que por medio de las capacitaciones y la convivencia muchas mujeres pierden la timidez de hablar en p\u00fablico y su auto estima incrementa.

She is also characterized by particular courage and determination. She is always ready to serve her customers. When she gets a new shipment in, she goes around the neighborhood to let folks know. <P>\r\n\r\nIsabelle began this business in 1990, selling smoked fish, with an initial capital of US$ 75. After having acquired a solid experience, she worked hard and managed her business well, and the profit she put aside amounted to a capital of more than US$ 400 in 2004. <P>\r\n\r\nFrom 2004-2007 the currency depreciation and price hikes perturbed her business and caused it to decrease. In August 2008, Isabelle decided to join one of the groups of Hope RDC called \"Prodigy\", intending to increase her capital and find permanent financial support. She is a faithful client who has received several loans from Hope RDC and has reimbursed them on time. The loan she has received this month of June allowed her to buy salted fish and flip-flops to resell so as to increase her revenue. Presently, her personal capital stands at US$ 150. Her dream is to open a general store. <P>\r\n\r\nIsabelle is married and the mother of 7 children, whose ages vary between 2 and 20. Five of them are enrolled in school. Isabelle is proud to be a micro-entrepreneur. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4025,"image":{"id":331789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchasing flip-flops and salted fish to resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

With the 500 soles she is requesting, she will have her fields cleared and hire laborers to help her cultivate them. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":581502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Hiring laborers to clear her fields and help her with planting","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-10T17:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariluz ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":559.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269266}],"funded_date":"2010-08-10T18:26:33Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":225456,"name":"Temukisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Temukisa F. is 27 and married with three children.

Most of her daily activities are the same as those of any other housewife - namely, tending to her two children who are still in elementary school. At the moment her husband, Gede Darmawan, is a chauffeur. Nengah Suciani makes bamboo decorations for a living. In the Balinese language, these thin slices of bamboo resembling palm leaf ribs are called \"semat\" and are used in religious functions. She has undertaken this business for the past four years as there is uncertainty about her husband\u2019s income. Making \u201csemat\u201d is something that can be done each daily. To create these decorations, Nengah Suciani must have enough supply of bamboo. A loan from DINARI foundation (channeled via her village\u2019s central organization) will allow Nengah Suciani to add to her business\u2019s working needs. \r\n<p> Nengah Suciani already has a regular roster of customers. The net earnings of Rp.20,000 per day (~ US $2) is just enough to cover daily necessities. Nengah Suciani lives in a house which is sufficiently comfortable with her husband and two kids. \r\n\r\n   <p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Aarati, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nNengah Suciani itulah nama ibu yang sudah memiliki dua  orang anak yang tinggal di desa Batu Agung, Bali barat. Kegiatan sehari-harinya layaknya seperti ibu rumah tangga lainnya, mengurus kedua anaknya yang masih duduk di bangku  sekolah dasar. Sedangkan suaminya bernama Gede Darmawan, adalah seorang sopir. Nengah Suciani mempunyai usaha membuat kerajinan yang terbuat dari bambu. Dalam bahasa Bali dinamakan Semat ( bambu yang diiris tipis yang menyerupai batang lidi pohon kelapa, biasa dipergunakan sebagai bahan baku sarana persembahyangan ). Usaha ini digelutinya sudah 4 tahun lamanya karena ia  tidak bisa berharap banyak dari penghasilan suaminya yg pas-pasan. Membuat semat adalah kegiatan rutin yang dilakukan setiap hari. Untuk membuat semat Nengah Suciani harus mempunyai persediaan bambu yang cukup. Dengan adanya bantuan modal dari yayasan DINARI yang disalurkan melalui organisasi yang ada didesanya  Nengah Suciani berniat meminjam modal untuk menambah modal usahanya.                                                                             \r\n<p>Nengah Suciani sudah punya pelanggang tetap. Dengan pendapatan bersih Rp. 20.000.- per hari yang hanya cukup untuk memenuhi kebutuhan sehari-sehari. Nengah Suciani tinggal disebuah rumah yang terbuat dari gedeg yang cukup nyaman dan sejuk bersama  suami dan kedua anaknya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":191319,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Religious

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History:<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has used her previous loans to stock up on the fast moving items in her inventory. And for this 20th loan cycle from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Carol wants to borrow PHP 50,000.00 to again add more items to her very wide variety of product offerings.\r\n\r\nCarol is very determined to work hard to provide a good and comfortable living for her family.

","en":"The Virgen D. Fatima Communal Bank, represented by Ms. Silvia Liliana, is comprised of 14 hard-working group members who are currently in their third loan cycle. They expect to earn better profits, demonstrating the desire to get ahead through honesty, responsibility and work. The group members run different businesses, such as selling bread, provisions, fast food, or cosmetics. They either work from home or as street vendors. Regarding competition, we can mention that their competitors are skilled businesspeople, but the group members have a solid client-base that generates the flow of money that is necessary for daily profits. This loan will be used to purchase merchandise to restock their shops, and purchase goods in bulk, such as sugar and flour. The cosmetic vendors will take advantage of the ongoing sales to make more profits and help support their families and improve their quality of life. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3775,"image":{"id":423341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Working capital ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T07:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3775,"lender_count":106,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvia Liliana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria  Nela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marlyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eldy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen Diana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":26500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":3775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2515.66},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2544.61},{"due_date":"2009-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2573.89},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2603.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2633.46},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":2663.76},{"due_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2694.42},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2725.42},{"due_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":2756.78},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2788.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":358.36},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":362.49},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":366.66},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":370.87},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375.15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":379.46},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":383.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":388.24},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":392.71},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":397.23}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1458.38,"local_amount":10237.66,"processed_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:08:52Z","rounded_local_amount":10237.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678767},{"amount":375.15,"local_amount":2633.46,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2633.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678768},{"amount":379.46,"local_amount":2663.76,"processed_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:27:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2663.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073256},{"amount":383.83,"local_amount":2694.42,"processed_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2694.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118073257},{"amount":388.24,"local_amount":2725.42,"processed_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:00:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2725.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909144},{"amount":392.71,"local_amount":2756.78,"processed_date":"2010-02-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:01:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2756.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123909145},{"amount":397.23,"local_amount":2788.5,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:55:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2788.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128944700}],"funded_date":"2009-12-23T22:23:06Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T08:55:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":155147,"name":"Sopheap","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sopheap P. is a villager in Prey Mei Lang Thboung village in Takeo province.

She is 47 years old. Jordiana is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Jordiana owns and operates a business venture providing recycling services. While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from hauling junk and other waste material for local businesses and community members. Jordiana has been engaged in her business for over 25 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jordiana joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jordiana has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4000 PHP from HSPFI. Jordiana is requesting a loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional scrap metal to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Jordiana from HSPFI. She plans to reinvest the additional revenue generated from the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

The months of July, October, November, and December are times when she gets the greatest earnings due to the dates of the holidays they celebrate in her area.\r\n\r\nShe generally works by herself.  But, during the holiday season she needs helpers as her daily routine is from 8:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m.  But, she is not content with it.  In the future she plans to expand her hair salon.  She will introduce new washing machines and hair irons.  She will do this to gain more customers.  At the same time she offers haircuts, weavings, and perms at lower prices than her competition.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  She promises to fulfill her payment obligations.  She is grateful to the institution for the ease of the loan that they offer.  She will use the requested money to buy tints for all types of hair.  With the rest of the money she will get beauty magazines.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":531623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Buy hair tints","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-29T20:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":154.91},{"due_date":"2010-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":158.71},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":164.32},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":168.71},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":174.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":179.04}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.09},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.52},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.26},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.37},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.09,"local_amount":154.91,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":165.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144752012},{"amount":59.52,"local_amount":158.71,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:57Z","rounded_local_amount":169.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934468},{"amount":61.62,"local_amount":164.32,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:54Z","rounded_local_amount":175.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673237},{"amount":63.26,"local_amount":168.71,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":179.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887063},{"amount":65.37,"local_amount":174.31,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:48Z","rounded_local_amount":185.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154078},{"amount":67.14,"local_amount":179.04,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":190.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449351}],"funded_date":"2010-05-16T17:08:56Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":200894,"name":"Edilberta Nicida","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Edilberta es socia del Banco Comunal Kallpanchik, palabra en quechua que significa Nuestra Fuerza.

Bimala thanks you for your support.<p>\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While  typical pasals might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. <p>\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business-training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Desde muy joven aprendi\u00f3 esta labor, puesto que ha trabajado en muchos talleres anteriormente, lo cual ha hecho que sea muy h\u00e1bil en esta actividad. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta de su trabajo es dejar los carros como nuevos, ya que se esmera mucho en repararlos, lleva 4 a\u00f1os trabajando como mec\u00e1nico y considera que lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es cargar los pesados repuestos que tiene que colocar a algunos carros. Para el futuro, espera abrir su propio taller con el cual pueda mejorar los ingresos que actualmente tiene. Este es el primer cr\u00e9dito con MFP, tiene muchas ganas de pagar a tiempo y sin demora, ya que desea acceder a m\u00e1s cr\u00e9ditos.

He and his 29-year old wife Nataly live with her parents and their beloved daughter 2-year old Juliana. He wants to provide a better quality of life for them.\r\n\r\nRoger works as a mechanic in one of the most sought-after garages in the city of Lima. Cars that leave there have always been carefully repaired. He learned this trade as a young man, and since then he has worked in many garages and become very skilled. What he most enjoys about his work is making cars like new again, and he does his best to repair them well. Roger has been doing this work for four years and considers that the most difficult part of his job is being responsible for the big repairs he has to do on some cars.\r\n\r\nIn the future Roger hopes to have his own workshop and increase the money he currently earns. This is his first loan with Kiva partner MFP, and he is very keen to pay back the money on time without any delays so that he can get more loans in the future. With the 1000 soles that he is asking for, he will buy new spare parts so he make better repairs to the cars.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":581549,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy car spare parts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-10T20:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roger ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:07Z","rounded_local_amount":1049.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269271}],"funded_date":"2010-08-12T02:50:35Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":225472,"name":"Litia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Litia T. is 30 and married with five children.

She delivers her produce to the tradesmen for each of the local markets in the zone.  The wholesale traders then sell the products to the different markets in the capital cities.  This economic activity doesn\u2019t bring in enough to allow them to live comfortably, so she also works in clothing retail and for this, she needs working capital.\r\n\r\nThis is the first loan Mrs. Filomena has obtained from our institution.  The loan will be used to buy merchandise in order to have a variety of products to sell.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Meet Rodgers, a very hardworking, energetic and honest man who is 23 years of age. He lives in the rich highlands of Kitale with his family. \r\n\r\nRodgers has been practicing farming for the past five years. Through those years, he has been able to support his family. His primary sources of income are milk, eggs, and crop farming. \r\n\r\nThe Kitale area is populated and has a ready market for poultry products. However, Rodgers' biggest challenge is lack of funds, which is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy poultry. \r\n\r\nPoultry farming is one of the profitable business ventures in Kenya, and one doesn\u2019t need to be a large-scale farmer to benefit from it. Through the loan, Rodgers will be able to sell eggs, meat and poultry feathers to the already existing market. The demand for chicken is always high, it being such a popular meal for many people as can be proved when you visit fast food joints in his area. \r\n\r\nRodgers has been facing challenges accessing finances, but he feels relieved knowing that institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva are there to make his dream come true. Rodgers chose Juhudi Kilimo because the interest rates on the loans are low and on a reducing basis. Rodgers underwent training through Juhudi Kilimo, learning that saving is a continuous process in many microfinance institutions.

lives with her husband and their 4 children in Lakkon village. Her husband has no permanent employment and does odd jobs. To help him  provide for the family  4 years ago Raihona decided to start selling children's clothing and footwear. Profits from this business help with many expenses for the kids and other family needs. Raihona has no permanent  trading place. She travels to the neighboring villages to sell  her goods. Previously her husband took out a loan from Microinvest and used it to buy, process and dry apricots. Dried apricots were sold with good profits. Raihona is applying for another loan to farther expand her business.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by [Elena Sheyner, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\u0420\u0430\u0439\u0445\u043e\u043d\u0430

Celsa C. is 29 years old and married.  She lives in a humble home with her husband Pedro Villalba who is 36 years old and helps with the income of the house.  Celsa has a dispensary in her house, and her husband is a specialist in the preparation of chacinados.  They have 2 children, 3 and 5 years old, who make up the harmonious family life. <\/p>\r\n<p> Celsa and her husband manage the dispensary where they sell all types of every day items such as sugar, milk, meat, eggs, vegetables, etc, and a special compliment of chacinados which Pedro is in charge of.  He prepares sausages, mortadela, ham, cold cuts, etc.  When the company where Pedro worked had financial problems and collapsed, he was left unemployed, so he decided, along with his wife, to learn this business for himself. <\/p>\r\n<p>The experience of 10 years of sales of these products, the knowledge of the consumer market, and the necessity to survive, are some of the pillars that sustain these enterprising people.  They have hired other unemployed people, experimenting in the preparation of chacinados,  so the enterprise is already  giving work to others.  The small company produces according to demand so there is no set schedule, nor days of work.  They make the sales in the dispensary and by request.  Today Celsa is requesting a loan to buy a meat shredding machine.  The dream of these enterprising business owners is to offer the opportunity of work to many unemployed youths in the area. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\nCelsa C. de 29 a\u00f1os, es casada, vive en una humilde vivienda con su c\u00f3nyuge el se\u00f1or Pedro Villalba de tiene 36 a\u00f1os quien ayuda con los ingresos de la casa. Celsa tiene una  despensa en su casa, su marido es especialista en la elaboraci\u00f3n de los chacinados. Tienen 2 hijos menores de edad, de 3 y 5 a\u00f1os respectivamente, quienes comparten la armoniosa vida familiar.\r\nCelsa y su c\u00f3nyuge, atienden la despensa donde venden todo tipo de art\u00edculos de primera necesidad, como az\u00facar, leche, carne, huevos, hortalizas, etc. y un complemento especial de ventas es la de chacinados de la cual se encarga exclusivamente don Pedro. El elabora chorizos, mortadela, fiambre, jam\u00f3n etc. Cuando la empresa donde trabajaba don Pedro, tuvo problemas financieros y quebr\u00f3, el qued\u00f3 desempleado, decidi\u00f3 con su esposa emprender por cuenta propia esta actividad.\r\nLa experiencia de 10 a\u00f1os en la venta de estos productos, el conocimiento del mercado consumidor, y la necesidad de sobrevivir, son algunos de los pilares que sostiene a estos emprendedores. Para producir calidad han contratado a otros desempleados experimentados en esta actividad (elaboraci\u00f3n de chacinados), o sea que el emprendimiento ya est\u00e1 dando trabajo a otras personas. La microempresa produce de acuerdo a la demanda por lo tanto no existe horario, ni d\u00edas de trabajo.\r\nLas ventas las realizan en la despensa y bajo pedido, hoy d\u00eda Celsa est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito que  ser\u00e1 destinado a la compra de una m\u00e1quina trituradora de carne adem\u00e1s de los ingredientes para la elaboraci\u00f3n  para la compra de carne, especias.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":303844,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Not having attended school for societal reasons, she soon became interested fifteen years ago in earning an income to support herself through such work as small-scale commerce.  Highly experienced, she is appreciated and in much demand in Koutiala.   These days, Kadidia is leaning a lot more towards the wholesale distributing and selling of <i>ati\u00e9k\u00e9<\/i> (a cassava or yam foodstuff).  \r\n<p>\r\nConcerned about satisfying her customers, Kadidia turned toward the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso two years ago.  After having settled an initial loan successfully, she envisions a second individual loan for a 12-month period in the amount of 500,000 francs CFA.  With this loan, she intends to resupply herself with a sizable stock of goods from Cote d\u2019Ivoire mostly for the retailers of <i>ati\u00e9k\u00e9<\/i> of Koutiala City.  In addition to restocking, she sells retail, aimed at consumers at the grand marketplace of Koutiala.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, she envisions realizing a profit of 150,000 francs CFA that will be used to make loan payments and to care for her children.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":312614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy supplies of \"ati\u00e9k\u00e9\"","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kadidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.83},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":170.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84468.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020245},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:44:39Z","rounded_local_amount":84468.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678786},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:11:14Z","rounded_local_amount":84468.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028176},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:04:26Z","rounded_local_amount":84468.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763277},{"amount":170.83,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-16T08:48:27Z","rounded_local_amount":84468.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991007},{"amount":170.85,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:13Z","rounded_local_amount":84468.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746132}],"funded_date":"2009-06-16T04:14:27Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T12:15:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":109920,"name":"Mercy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mercy N. is 35 years old and married with six children.

Dulamsuren is 52 years old and lives with her husband in Uvurkhangai province in central Mongolia. She and her husband live in a ger, which is a traditional Mongolian nomadic housing tent. She operates a dairy products trading business in her town. She purchases dairy products locally from herders in the surrounding countryside, and transports them back to her town to sell. \r\n\r\nDulamsuren started her business in 2008, after previously managing several different businesses over the years. She has worked hard and has built a stable operation over the last two years. She attributes her success to her good accounting skills and reasonable prices. Dulamsuren is looking toward the future and says, \"I hope to expand my business and own my own shop in the future.\" She is requesting a 2,000,000 tugrug (~1400 USD) loan to increase her inventory so that she has plenty to sell when supplies get short this winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout XacBank\r\nXacBank was founded in 2001, and listed its first loan on Kiva in January 2009.

It is currently utilizing Kiva\u2019s 0% lending interest rate to return 9% of interest paid from borrowers to them in the form of a savings account at the end of their loans.

Serigne Babacar Sy Group No. 14","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sope Serigne Babacar Sy is an association of female commercantes (vendors) working in Thies, a city about seventy kilometers from Dakar.\r\n\r\nThe association, named after an important marabout (a religious leader in West African Islam), was founded in 2006 by a group of entrepreneurial women from the Cit\u00e9 Lamy neighborhood. Their aim was to help the members finance their small businesses through a revolving savings fund called a tontine, in which members contribute a small amount to the pot each month to finance one member's activities.\r\n\r\nToday, the association has evolved to secure group loans for its members through cooperation with UIMCEC (Union of Institution Mutualiste Communautaire d\u2019Epargne et de Credit). Groups of five are financed through ten-month loans of which each member receives an equal amount. On the 20th of each month, the members of the association hold a meeting to collect the repayments.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are fourteen groups of women financed through UIMCEC. Sope Serigne Babacar Sy is headed by Ms. Coumba Faye, the president, and Ms. Oumu Ngom, the treasurer.\r\n\r\nMs. Fatou G. is the head of Group No. 14. She, like many of the women, has a small stall in the market of Grand Thies, one of the bigger neighborhoods of Thies. She sells sandwiches, starting around 7 a.m. and often finishing around midnight. She says her specialty is a beef sandwich with fried onions. If she has the money, Ms. G. also buys handbags and bras to sell in the market. Ms. G. is married, and the mother of seven children.\r\n\r\nThree of the other group members also work in the Grand Thies market: Ms. Amy N. runs a small restaurant, serving rice dishes, such as thi\u00e9bu dieune (rice and fish); Ms. Fatou N. sells guedia (dried fish); and Ms. Ndeye Mari\u00e8me Djit\u00e9 sells women's clothing, mostly pants. The final group member, Ms. Adama N., sells vegetables and fish out of her home. Each member receives 100,000 FCFA to bolster their activities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":466134,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To use as additional capital for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-01-11T15:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye Marieme","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adama","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:49:26Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118168531},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:35:02Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124007493},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-03-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:16:18Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129036565},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:34Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759123},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790637},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-17T08:36:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971076},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708340},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-24T08:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922411},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172188914},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-23T12:00:37Z","rounded_local_amount":50818.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484358}],"funded_date":"2010-01-13T02:18:49Z","paid_date":"2010-11-23T12:00:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":171677,"name":"Jeanne","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"B.

Jeanne was born in 1963 in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin.  She became situated in Y\u00e9nawa, a district of Cotonou, about fifteen years ago.  She is married to HOUNSOU Nicolas and is the mother of two children, who are both in school.  The family lives together in Y\u00e9nawa.  Thanks to the revenues she earns from her business, Jeanne works in aid of her husband where it concerns maintaining the children's education.\r\n\r\nBasically, Jeanne did not attend school, but she has been selling canned drinks in her store for ten years.  She stocks up in Lom\u00e9, Togo, a country neighboring Benin.  \r\n\r\nShe is a previous client of ALID\u00e9 having already obtained three loans from it.  She has repaid these three loans.  Jeanne envisions increasing her inventory of goods and diversifying her business by selling a variety of other products.  This will enable her to do better in satisfying the demands of her customers.  But due to few financial means available to her, she is requesting a fourth loan to expand her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She began working as a production assistant in a recreational fireworks company.  Thanks to the fact that she was able to save some of her income, she used her expertise to set up her own fireworks business called \"El Trueno\" (thunder).  She also works at night as a cook in a restaurant four times a week.  Most of her customers are people who visit the central part of the country.  \r\n\r\nWith her income she is able to cover the essential household expenses.

She has farmed all her life, as she didn't manage to complete her schooling due to lack of financial means. \r\n\r\nIn the course of time, she bought her own land. Since then, she has tried very hard to grow quality crops, as she fertilizes using organic methods, which are much better for your health.  In addition, this contributes to caring for the environment, as only animal manure is used. This work is important to her, and she wants her children to also apply this technique when they have their own land. \r\n\r\nToday there is a lot of demand for her crops from the wholesalers, who pay well for every kilo they buy. Therefore she wants to expand her plantings in order to increase her production of coffee and cacao. \r\n\r\nThis will be her first loan from MFP, so she is committed to making her payments on time.
