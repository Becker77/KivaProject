Mafi has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 400 WST a month from these activities.\n\nIn 2009, Mafi joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Mafi is requesting for the first time a loan from SPBD.    Mafi is now requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering.

Marissa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI. Marissa is requesting a new loan, her second, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future.

This will be favorable for them because it will produce capital to be used in future projects, including building their house.  \r\n\r\nThis investment will greatly improve the family\u2019s standard of living, especially for the youngsters because living conditions will be better and to the great satisfaction of the parents for being able to provide a more prosperous future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":538791,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":" To buy fertilizers, fungicides and other farm supplies.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2010-05-13T22:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ludis Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":12000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":12000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:22:15Z","rounded_local_amount":12499.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211147208}],"funded_date":"2010-06-09T12:48:17Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T10:22:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":204115,"name":"Colette","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9e en 1975 \u00e0 Porto-Novo, capitale administrative du B\u00e9nin, A.

They are her motivation to succeed. Many years ago she worked for a textile company, and at the time, had learned everything there was to know about that profession. That is why she decided to start her own business which makes and sells handbags. She  now works at a market in the area of quality control, and while there sells bags and purses to her friends and coworkers. What she likes most about her business is that it generates good income without taking up too much time, which allows her to help educate her children. She has been doing business enthusiastically for five years, and her husband has been simultaneously supporting her with work by getting her the necessary materials that she needs. In the future, what she most wants is to finish construction on her house in order to make her family safer.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has a retail shop where she sells different kinds of groceries. Lhen has had this business for four years. She is thankful because she is blessed with five children. \r\n\r\nLhen is requesting for a loan of PHP 50,000 to purchase additional groceries, such as soft drinks, biscuits, canned goods, noodles and other daily basic necessity items. Due to the high cost of basic commodities, she would like to have additional stocks of groceries so that she can minimize her expenses in going to and from the market. Each month, Lhen is able to earn about PHP 10,000 from her grocery business.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Lhen hopes to improve her shop so that she can encourage more customers to buy at her store. She thus also hopes that she can obtain the loan amount that she has requested so that she can maintain her business and provide for the needs of her

The first challenge is being in a vulnerable part of the country; the second \u2013 being a woman. \r\n\r\nGulanda, 46, is the leader of this group. She is a widow and has two daughters, the older of whom is 20. The year of 1996 was a turning point in Gulanda\u2019s life. She risked all her savings by investing them in a purchase of 5 head of cattle, which left her  with almost no funds to live on. Having two kids to feed, Gulanda had no time to hesitate and she quickly started to work on promoting the business. It was repaid and currently she owns up to 40 head of livestock, which is the biggest herd in the neighborhood. Her monthly profit is about 5,000 soms. She doesn\u2019t plan to stop at this and looks forward to expanding the herd. The purpose of the loan is to purchase 3-4 goats. \r\n\r\n          --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

That is why every weekend she and her husband care for their coffee crops. They have done it for 16 years, and their beans are very well-recognized at the Alto Palomar cooperative, where she sells in every agricultural season. She says that she continually maintains coffee nurseries, with which they renew their old plantations. They now have three thousand plantlings in germination; with these they hope to have new and better beans. She also says that her husband works in a bakery. Every morning, Monday to Friday, he goes very early to a shop where he works; there he makes the rich bread and pastry that delight the residents of their town every morning. This is where he makes extra money, which is how they hope to gather what they need to buy more agricultural land.

Luz has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Luz joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Luz has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Luz is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Luz from HSPFI.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON International's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

is a 60-year-old married woman who supports her family by operating 2 ventures: a general store and a pig fattening business. She lives in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. Nema has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her two businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 9,000. Nema is borrowing PHP 18,000 in order to fund business operations. This will be her 10th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Nema hopes to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\n<p>About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is a housewife who is loving and is protective of her family. After finishing house chores, she works on her farm and does all this is because she wants to improve her family's living conditions, to show progress, and to give her four children the opportunity to study and prepare themselves for life in a good way. She also does some side hustle business. Florence has been farming for the past 10 years. Over the years, she has gathered much experience and is considered among the best farmers in her village. Her primary sources of income have been milk, eggs and crops. Florence is very passionate about farming and loves cultivating her farm. Although she makes profits from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by buying seeds so that she can plant them and sell them after harvesting. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy farm implements such as seeds. Kenya's Maguncha, Kenyenya area one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for food. This means that Florence could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. She now feels relieved because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with the wonderful KIVA lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing.

From past experience, Lucilo and his wife have much more work in the summer than during other times of the year. Due to the sweltering temperatures in Paraguay, ice cream is in high demand. During the summer months, which Paraguay is now entering, Lucilo must produce a much larger quantity of ice cream to meet consumer demands. The laundry also requires work but less so than the ice cream parlor. The laundry is almost automated, as Lucilo and Elodia own four washing machines and two driers. <p>The loan they have requested will go toward building another small salon in which they can make more ice cream. In this way they will be able to better serve their clients at the ice cream parlor. With the laundry they have already established fixed weekly customers and are less concerned about growth in this respect. With the money they earn from both endeavors they are able to maintain their family and put their two children through

Two of her children are in senior high school while the other two are in junior high school. Gifty says her husband\u2019s business is not booming now. As a result, she works very hard to help provide for the family and most importantly, to pay the children\u2019s school fees. <P>\r\n\r\nGifty sells varieties of drinks and mineral water both in bottles and also in cans.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

Instead of asking her children for financial support, Evencia joined ASHI in 2005 wanting to request for a loan which will be used for a business which she and her husband could do their share of managing. Evencia knew that her children are also financially incapable to sustain the needs of their own family. Therefore, not even a single cent of her loan was wasted for unnecessary things.  It was used for financing a vegetable and fish buy and sell businesses. These businesses enable the old couple have a regular meal which is three times daily for Filipino. \n\nEvencia is not aiming for a bigger amount of loan to apply though she is qualified. Considering her age, and health, she knows her capacity to run a business. Loan she is requesting now and in the future will be used to sustain her previous and present business. This opportunity brings joy to Evencia since this has not only enabled her to support her needs and her husband\u2019s but this is also her means of exercise mentally and physically because she sells not just in one place but in a lot of different places which sometimes requires a lot of walking for a house to house

Initially, the ELA program provides disadvantaged adolescents, particularly girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Later, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age, improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.

It is made up of four persons from Belek village who have the same interests in animal breeding. In this village, cattle breeding is the main means of subsistence and maintenance of the family for many people. \r\n\r\nGulkaky S. is the leader of the group. She is 55, married and has one son of school age. Gulkaky started her milk-selling business by purchasing a milch (dairy) cow. Today, this activity brings her about 2,500 Kyrgyzstan Soms (KGS) monthly.   \r\n\r\nGulkaky applies for a loan to buy one more milch (dairy) cow, which will allow her to increase the amount of milk for selling. With the revenues, Gulkaky plans to give a good education to her son. She also wishes to take her family on a good vacation some day.\r\n\r\nGroup members:\r\n\r\nRoza M. is 49 years old, single and has one son, who is 8 years old. She has been engaged in cattle breeding for 15 years. Roza started her business with her initial investment of 3,000 KGS.  She plans to use this loan to purchase two bull calves for fattening and reselling.\r\n \r\nChinarkul C. is 28, divorced and has one son. Seven years ago, in order to meet the expenses of her small family, she started her business in cattle breeding. She milks cows and sells dairy products to loyal customers. Using this loan,  Chinarkul plans to buy two bull calves for fattening and reselling. \r\n\r\nChingiz T. is the youngest member of the group. He is 22 years old and single. He works in a confectioner's shop and helps his parents with animal breeding. Chingiz began his own business in fattening cattle five years ago.

She is applying for a loan for PHP 35,000 to buy more groceries to sell in her store, where sales have been very high lately because it is located along a busy road.

Teresa es muy ingeniosa, es por eso que le va bien en su negocio y por otro lado puede ayudar en los gastos de  hogar, pues su esposo es comerciante de choclos en uno de los mercados de su localidad y las ganancias que no siempre cubren todos los gastos.

She lives with her husband Emilian and her children, 18-year-old Kenji, 11-year-old Carol and 2-year-old Jahir, in their own house.<br>\r\nShe has sold catalogue cosmetics for 9 years. Her work involves showing her magazines and catalogues to potential customers, so that they can see the products on offer, and receiving different orders, which she then makes through the company that employs her. She has her own discount catalogue, so she makes a profit by purchasing large quantities using this catalogue and then selling products at the original price. She gets approximately 25% per product. \r\nTeresa is very resourceful, which is why her business is going well and why she can also contribute to household costs. Her husband sells corn in one of the town\u2019s markets and his earnings don\u2019t always cover all their expenses. This is why Teresa is happy in her work and hopes to someday have a shop with her cosmetics products in the window.<br>\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP and she has always been punctual with her repayments. She also enjoys working with her group. She will use the requested money to purchase a larger quantity of cosmetics to have them in stock, and thus make more sales.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carolyn McCaffrey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":350809,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase her merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-07-13T01:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":92.36},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":94.3},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":97.74},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":101.69},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":105.02},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":108.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.79},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.43},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.58},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.9},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.01},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":42.91,"local_amount":128.73,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:42Z","rounded_local_amount":130.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211989},{"amount":19.31,"local_amount":57.93,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:27:16Z","rounded_local_amount":58.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641517},{"amount":32.58,"local_amount":97.74,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:39:12Z","rounded_local_amount":99.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080957},{"amount":33.9,"local_amount":101.69,"processed_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:14:43Z","rounded_local_amount":103.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997098},{"amount":35.01,"local_amount":105.02,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":106.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842453},{"amount":36.29,"local_amount":108.89,"processed_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":110.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734017}],"funded_date":"2009-07-13T06:15:37Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:23:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":125461,"name":"\u0410\u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0439","description":{"languages":["ru"],"texts":{"ru":"    MLF \u201cMicroInvest\u201d is one of the leading microfinance organizations, rendering credit services to the population of Tajikistan.

She is 52 years old. Debbie is the leader of a 8-member loan group sponsored by ASKI. Although each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is \"Caliguian Center.\"\r\n\r\nDebbie is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Debbie owns and operates a general store where she sells a variety of products in the local community. Debbie has been engaged in her business for over 13 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Debbie joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Debbie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. She used her previous loan to buy products to sell. Debbie is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP to buy products to sell. This will be Debbie's 7th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Kerti 1 Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ni Putu W. (0) is a 39-year-old female living in the town of Sombang, Jembrana, Bali. She is the group leader of a four-member group loan offered by MUK. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Panca Kerti 1 (MUK-0008).\n\nNi Putu is widowed and has two school-aged children. She owns and operates a general store, selling both food and daily-use products in the local community. She has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 500,000 IDR a month.\n\nIn 2007, Ni Putu joined MUK to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting for the first time a loan from MUK. She is now requesting a new loan of 2,250,000 IDR which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. The loan will be her 1st from MUK.\n\nNi Putu plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income.\n\n\n About MUK:\nThe mission of Koperasi Mitra Usaha Kecil (MUK) is to assist small businesses in Bali by providing training, business consultation and loans thereby helping the owners and their families improve their everyday lives.\n\n\nNote to Kiva Lenders:  \nThis group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender.\n\nThis is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner, MUK, will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers. As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.\n \nTo learn more about Village Banking on Wikipedia, please click here.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":503813,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional products to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2010-03-15T23:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Putu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":9000000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":9000000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":9000000,"processed_date":"2011-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:30:33Z","rounded_local_amount":9195000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201319851}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T12:36:52Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:30:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":4,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":187775,"name":"Fatoumata","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Fatoumata F. est \u00e2g\u00e9e de 35 ans, elle est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 3 enfants.

If educated citizens are in search of jobs, then unskilled workers have lost hope completely. Unfortunately, our nation cannot provide every citizen with a worthy job, so most workers have to be headed abroad. The Russian Federation is the best option for workers. First, the language is not a barrier. Kyrgyzstan as a former Soviet Union Republic still uses the Russian language as a second official one. Also, Russia is in great need of cheap labor, so this cooperation benefits both sides. In many families in rural areas of Kyrgyzstan, at least one member of the family is employed abroad. \r\n\r\nGulnozkhon T., 44, is from a village called Aravan in Southern Kyrgyzstan. Her husband left to go to Russia in search of better opportunities to earn money. There, he works as  a construction builder.  Her older daughter is a seamstress and the family is getting ready for her upcoming wedding. Gulnozkhon\u2019s second daughter and a son also help out about the house.  The family business is cultivating and selling cotton.  The purpose of the loan is purchasing a dowry for her daughter\u2019s wedding, broadening her business by raising livestock also and making repairs in their house. \r\n\r\nGavharoi R., 40, is involved in raising and selling bulls. Her husband and two sons work in Russia.  She plans to spend this loan on purchasing more livestock and broadening her business. She would like to spend her profit on finishing the construction of some of the rooms in her house. \r\n\r\nTakhir T., 39, raises poultry. The purpose of the loan is to start raising livestock and reselling it. He plans to spend the profit on developing his business and on repairing the house. \r\n\r\nOktyabrkhon E., 43, raises livestock. She also does dairy farming. She needs this loan to finish the construction of her house and arrange weddings for her daughters.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

His parents taught him how to get by as an agriculturist and he learned very well. Now that he is the father of two children and still works as an agriculturalist. Thanks to his parents Mirzokosim now has the opportunity to move forward as a farmer and he hopes to increase his agricultural products so that he can bring his loved ones a more promising life. Despite being a good agriculturalist and worker he needs help to move forward and improve his production. This is why he is asking for a loan, so that he can buy more of the seeds and fertilizers he needs, which are very expensive, but without them his production will not improve. You can help Mirzokosim keep moving forward with his development plans.    \r\n\r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Todos ellos pertenecientes a la ciudad de Valpara\u00edso.\nSergio quien en la foto aparece sentado en el primer puesto de derecha a izquierda, viste una boina y chaqueta color negro, adem\u00e1s gesticula con sus manos el signo de la paz. Se dedica a la artesan\u00eda en cueros desde hace 40 a\u00f1os. Realiza vestuario y bolsos en cuero, espec\u00edficamente chaquetas, pantalones, morrales, bananos, monederos, entre otros. Para la fabricaci\u00f3n de sus productos habilit\u00f3 una habitaci\u00f3n en su casa como taller, ah\u00ed cuenta con una m\u00e1quina de coser industrial. \nSus productos los ofrece de manera particular y sus clientes realizan los pedidos a medida. Adem\u00e1s su hijo le ayuda con la promoci\u00f3n de sus productos y le encarga trabajos. Comenta que tiene bastante material, sin embargo considera que a veces le falta tiempo para trabajar, su horario es durante todos los d\u00edas de la semana, pero es relativo. Sus productos los env\u00eda a la ciudad de Santiago por encomienda. \nLa temporada de verano es favorable para ofrecer y vender sus productos, debido a que concurren bastantes turistas a \u00e9sta zona. \nCon el pr\u00e9stamo comprar\u00e1 cueros de varios colores, cierres y pegamento.\nSus metas son comprar una m\u00e1quina de coser que le permita realizar una puntada m\u00e1s definida y una mejor terminaci\u00f3n en sus trabajos. Adem\u00e1s expandirse en su negocio y poder ense\u00f1arle a m\u00e1s gente, con esto generar fuentes de trabajo. Comenta que no le conviene establecerse en un local comercial, ya que se dedica a producir y esto le demandar\u00eda m\u00e1s tiempo. \nSergio vive junto a su esposa, quien realiza mermeladas caseras. Sus sue\u00f1os son comprar un terreno para construir una casa, para esto espera vender su casa y contar con el capital para invertir en su proyecto. \nSergio est\u00e1 muy contento y agradecido D. cr\u00e9dito otorgado por Fondo Esperanza.

All of the members live in the town of Valpara\u00edso. \r\n\r\nSergio (seated first on the right in the photo, wearing a black hat and jacket, and making the peace sign) has made crafts out of leather for 40 years. He makes clothing and bags, specifically jackets, pants, backpacks, pouches, wallets etc. He fixed up a room in his house as a workshop and has an industrial sewing machine there.\r\n\r\nSergio only makes items to order and sells them privately. His son also  helps with advertising and is responsible for some jobs. He says that he has lots of material but sometimes lacks the time to do the work. He works every day of the week but it varies somewhat. Sergio sends his products to Santiago by bus where they are picked up by the customer. The summer is a good time of year for selling his products as many tourists come to the area then. \r\n\r\nWith the loan Sergio plans to buy leather in a variety of colours, fasteners, and glue.  His goal is to buy a sewing machine that make more defined stitches and give a better finish. He also wishes to expand the business and teach more people how to do the work. This will generate more income for him. He says that it wouldn\u2019t suit him to have a stall or store as he only wishes to make the products, not sell them, as it would take up too much time.\r\n\r\nSergio\u2019s wife makes jam in their home. Their dream is to buy a piece of land where they can build a house. To do this, they would need to sell their current home and get some money to invest in the project. \r\n\r\nSergio is very happy and grateful for the loan obtained through Fondo Esperanza. As a member of the group he has recently got to know the other members and learn about their businesses.\r\n\r\nValpara\u00edso is located 120 km northeast of Santiago. It is the regional capital and also home to the national legislature. The city is also the main port for the country and has beautiful, picturesque countryside where, for example, the house of Nobel prize the poet Pablo Neruda\u2019s house is located."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2750,"image":{"id":817818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy leather in a variety of colours, fasteners, and glue","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Valpara\u00edso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-07-22T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2750,"lender_count":98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sergio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pedro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jorge","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sandra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nicole","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1262520,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":84708},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":85518},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":86328},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":87156},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87984},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":88830},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":89676},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":90540},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":91404},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":92268},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":93150},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":94050},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":94950},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":95958}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":184.51},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.27},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.04},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.84},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.65},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.49},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.21},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.09},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.98},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.9},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.86},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.82},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":209.01}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":748.66,"local_amount":343710,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:45:05Z","rounded_local_amount":346638.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221666447},{"amount":976.77,"local_amount":448434,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":452254.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227035304},{"amount":815.56,"local_amount":374418,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:00:12Z","rounded_local_amount":377608.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232795961},{"amount":209.01,"local_amount":95958,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:11:44Z","rounded_local_amount":96775.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238606883}],"funded_date":"2011-07-23T18:13:02Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:11:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":322999,"name":"Lucy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lucy is 37 years old.

Esta es su historia: Mi nombre es Geidy Chantal, tengo 21 a\u00f1os de edad, nac\u00ed en la ciudad de Monte Plata el 17, de febrero de 1994, tengo 3 hermanas y actualmente vivo con mi madre, una de mis hermanas y mi sobrina.\nA la edad de 8 a\u00f1os me mude junto a mi madre y hermanas a la ciudad de Santo Domingo, gracias a que un familiar de mi madre nos prest\u00f3 una casa, all\u00ed duramos alrededor de 12 a\u00f1os. Estudie en la escuela Celina Pellier de los Mameyes y luego conclu\u00ed los estudios m\u00e9dicos en el Polit\u00e9cnico Pilar Constanzo en Villa Duarte, donde me gradu\u00e9 de Bachiller T\u00e9cnico en Contabilidad y Gesti\u00f3n Administrativa.\nMi madre realizaba trabajos dom\u00e9sticos, de los cuales nos benefici\u00e1bamos mis hermanas y yo, luego le fue diagnosticada una enfermedad, lo cual impidi\u00f3 que siguiera con su labor. Mi padre se fue a Estados Unidos cuando ten\u00eda 2 a\u00f1os, y lo volv\u00ed a ver a la edad de 13 a\u00f1os, y desde entonces no he recibido ayuda o apoyo alguno de parte de \u00e9l.\nActualmente estudio en la Universidad APEC, la carrera de Negocios Internacionales, la cual me gustar\u00eda ejercer con toda pasi\u00f3n y lo m\u00e1s importante poder llegar a terminarla, ya que desde el 2012, cuando finalice mis estudios medios, me ha sido dif\u00edcil este proceso, he tenido que parar en muchas ocasiones y ya quisiera terminar mi carrera.\nEste pr\u00e9stamo estar\u00eda cambiando mi vida, no solo en lo acad\u00e9mico, sino tambi\u00e9n en lo personal, porque debido a mi situaci\u00f3n en la universidad muchas veces sufro de baja autoestima y desanimo, por creer que no me ser\u00e1 posible terminar la universidad, que es mi prioridad ahora mismo. En caso de no recibir la ayuda, pues la historia que ha venido pasando desde el 2012 hasta la fecha, se estar\u00eda repitiendo, debido a que he buscado otras formas y no logro encontrar una manera de poder continuar mis estudios.\nUna vez termine mis estudios, mi deseo es poder poner en pr\u00e1ctica todo lo aprendido y comenzar con estudios de post-grado, quiero hacer un master en Derecho Internacional. Pues esto me gusta much\u00edsimo. En la universidad que estudio tienen un programa de doble titulaci\u00f3n, me gustar\u00eda participar en el para poder ejercer en el exterior, tambi\u00e9n ayudar a mi madre y mis hermanas igual como lo han hecho hasta ahora,  de la misma manera poder servir de ejemplo a mis sobrinas y que mi familia sienta orgullo de m\u00ed.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2047096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education

Not only does she does she raise her children, but she also fulfills her obligation to her husband by helping to increase their family income through her work. To meet her family's needs, she started a business raising sows.  Starting with just one sow, she now has two.  The sows cost her 800,000 Rupiah a piece, and, tended well, produce 5-10 healthy piglets.  The sale of the piglets from both sows can results in revenue of as much as 5,000,000 Rupiah.  She has already been in this business for several years, which has paid for her children's primary education and a small amount has helped her to start a small store in front of her house. From all of her hard work she has gained lots of useful experience in growing her business. She now sees a new opportunity to move\r\nher business even further forward.  She plans to raise fatted pigs, which are in high demand for use in Bali's famous roasted pork dish (babi guling). In fact, restaurants specializing in babi guling are becoming more and more common in Bali.  Because of the excellent market for fatted pigs, Ni Nengah Tayu plans to raise additional sows.   To help her with the expansion of her business, Ni Nengah Tayu would like to borrow capital to purchase more stock animals and special feed for all of her sows.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Courtenay Teska Race, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nNi Nengah Tayu adalah seorang ibu rumah tangga yang benar-benar memahami bahwa tanggung jawabnya di keluarga tidak hanya mengasuh anak, tetapi juga berkewajiban membantu suami untuk meningkatkan kesejahteraan keluarga.  Menjalankan usaha ternak babi khususnya penginduk menjadi pilihannya. Berawal dari seekor penginduk saja saat ini Ni Nengah Tayu sudah mampu memelihara dua ekor penginduk. Penginduk ini dibelinya seharga Rp. 800.000,- per ekor dan dipelihara dengan baik dan bisa menghasilkan 5-10 ekor anak yang sehat sehingga kalau dihitung, hasil penjualannya bisa mencapai Rp. 5.000.000 dari  ke dua ekor penginduk tersebut. Usaha yang sudah digeluti selama beberapa tahun ini mampu membiayai kebutuhan pendidikan anaknya dan sebagian kecil disisihkannya untuk membuka warung kecil di depan rumahnya. Dari kegiatan usahanya ini Ni Nengah Tayu mendapat banyak pengalaman yang bermanfaat dalam pengembangan usahanya. \r\nNi Nengah Tayu melihat adanya peluang untuk mengembangkan usahanya supaya lebih maju yaitu dengan banyaknya permintaan ternak babi penggemukan untuk babi guling, karena Bali sangat terkenal dengan masakan babi gulingnya, sehingga usaha rumah makan babi guling juga semakin banyak. Rencananya adalah selain penginduk Ni Nengah Tayu juga  memelihara penggemukan  karena pemasarannyapun juga sudah jelas. Dalam hal ini DINARI memberikan dukungan dalam bentuk pimjaman modal usaha dan ini dimanfaatkannya untuk pembelian stok  pakan yang bisa mencukupi semua kebutuhan pakan ternaknya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":96445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"for

Today she runs a small business selling baked goods and confectionery in a small store. Her business boasts a wide assortment of fresh inventory at reasonable prices. Oksana has been in this trade for 3 years. Her working capital amounts to 60,000 UAH. She makes about 5,000 UAH on the goods she sells every month.\r\n\r\nOksana works long hours to keep her business sustainable and growing. She is a friendly vendor and loves owning her business. Oksana\u2019s customers are always satisfied with the quality of the products she sells in her little store. She manages to keep fresh groceries even when the heat is at its worst and food products can easily spoil. Oksana is requesting a loan of 5,000 UAH to diversify the merchandise in her store. She believes that a more varied inventory will be more of an attraction for her customers and will increase her business income. We think that her natural ability to cheer people up with a word of encouragement or a smile will also help attract potential new clients and boost her sales as a result. One of the long-term plans Oksana and her husband have is to start a second business selling construction supplies in their home town of Kamenka.

Her sole activity for this loan will be to buy and sell \u201cdry fish\u201d in the market in Baingo. Here, dry fish is used in many dishes as it is ground up and added in for flavor and protein. Helen will buy 100,000 CFA (about $200) worth of dry fish and use the remaining money to transport it.  \r\n\r\nThis being nothing new to Helen, she is confident she will be successful with this loan. She knows that the fish always sells in the market due to the high demand for it. This will be Helen\u2019s second loan from GHAPE since she became a beneficiary in 2008.\r\n\r\nIn the last three years, Helen has lost three of her children. Although saddened by this unfortunate circumstance, Helen still has to take care of her other children. She plans to use the profits from this loan to pay for food for the family, pay her children\u2019s school fees and increase her business. \r\n\r\nHelen takes out GHAPE loans because the loan conditions are right for her, as she pays back her loan in small installments, instead of all at once.

GHAPE works toward the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

She sells a lot of fish which she buys in the city of Maputo (about 9km away) for 1,050MT per box and sells for 1,500MT.  She is able to earn 400MT daily.  Some times she has been able to save through a traditional savings schedule composed of a group of about 10 ladies.\r\n\r\nShe is not responsible for any more people.  She has never had a loan through other institutions, and this is her 4th loan with Hluvuku-Adsema in the amount of 10,000MT.  She will use it to buy products of primary necessity.  The first loans were all used for the business, 5,500MT, 6,500MT, and 6,000MT respectively.\r\n\r\nShe came to know Hluvuku through her neighbor who is also a client.  She hopes to see her business continually grow and deposit the increased receipts in the bank, in an account she will open soon.

She is married and has 3 children. Two of her children are currently in school. Loy has been running a tailoring business for the past 2 years.          \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Loy has requested a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more materials like cloth for sewing. With the help of the loan from BRAC, Loy hopes to generate greater profits and sometimes buy food. In the future, she hopes to own a tailoring school. She is a member of BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, which has helped her prospects for the future by helping her to become a good leader and learning how to be confident. \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n

Muslima is 35 years-old. She is married with two children. For three years she has been working in a beauty salon. In the salon, she provides various services such as hair styling and cutting, manicures and the services of a cosmetologist. Her business is successful and generates a stable income for her family. Now Muslima is planning to purchase cosmetics and other accessories for her beauty salon.  For this purpose she is requesting a loan of 7500 Somoni. Muslima thanks all supporting her and promises to repay the loan promptly.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve agricultural production and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

His got his school diploma in 1997,   however he could not continue his education because of the death of his older brother, who was the only one supporting him.  Realizing that he must support himself, as well as the five children of his deceased older brother, he took the job of motorbike taxi driver under these very difficult conditions.  Since he does not own his own motorbike, he ultimately earns very little for all his work.  He feels defeated by this harsh reality and is at the end of his wits, particularly since he is married and the father of three children of his own.  His greatest wish now is to be able to have his own motorbike, so that he can make more money and provide for his extended family.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nTo do this, he is applying for a $1,000 loan for a motorbike and the insurance for it.

She is living with her husband and their beloved one-year-old daughter.

The store has its key activities at night, even though it\u2019s open in the morning. The atmosphere is very pleasant, because there is good sound equipment, and almost all types of drinks are sold. Customers seize upon that time to play dominos and cards there.\r\n<p>\r\nGenerally, Sorangel has to go to Santo Domingo, the capital, every weekend to buy wholesale drinks.  Since the terrain is pretty rough, the delivery service of the drinks companies can\u2019t easily take the goods to her business.  So she\u2019s obliged to rent an expensive truck and take the supplies to her.\r\n<p>\r\nUp until now, the business has been profitable.  In fact, when we visited her store, we could observe that there was nothing left to sell.

In the community of Barranche, the business is very profitable being that despite many of them working in it, they continue to invest in their respective businesses due to the demand in their products.\r\n\r\n<P>They believe that the loans they receive are of utmost importance being that without said injection of funds, their businesses would be unable to prosper. Fortunately, they were able to pay their past loans easily. One important detail worth mentioning is that previously, in rural communities, those that offered the loans charged up to 10% interest per day. For this reason, institutions like Friendship Bridge are of vital importance to microfinance being that now the women can have dependable access to loans.\r\n\r\n<P>These ladies are currently working in the livestock breeding industry. Many of them are breeding chickens, pigs and bulls. The animals they breed depend on the demand in the market. However, the dream of some of them is to learn to make cakes, finger foods and handicrafts. This is because they want to diversify their businesses so that they do not have to depend on one sole source of income. The dream of some others is to pay off their loan, then take out another one that allows them to purchase more livestock.\r\n\r\n<P>This group of women is very enthusiastic, and for that reason we must give them wings in the form of a loan. They have the disposition to work hard, since they have been doing it their whole lives to survive the harsh conditions of poverty.

En la comunidad de Barranche el negocio es muy rentable, ya que a pesar de que muchas se\u00f1oras trabajan en ganader\u00eda ellas siguen invirtiendo en su mismo negocio debido a la demanda que tienen por sus productos. \r\n\r\n<P>Ellas creen que los pr\u00e9stamos que ellas reciben le son de suma utilidad ya que sin dicha infusi\u00f3n de dinero sus negocios no podr\u00edan prosperar. Por suerte, ellas pudieron pagar las cuotas de sus pr\u00e9stamos pasados con comodidad. Un detalle importante es que en las comunidades rurales anteriormente las personas que daban cr\u00e9ditos cobraban hasta un 10% al d\u00eda. Es por eso que instituciones como Friendship Bridge ayuda mucho al desarrollo de la micro empresa ya que ahora las mujeres pueden tener acceso confiable al cr\u00e9dito. \r\n\r\n<P>Estas se\u00f1oras por el momento est\u00e1n trabajando en el \u00e1rea de crianza de animales. Muchas de ellas est\u00e1n criando pollos, cerdos y toros. Los animales que cr\u00edan depende de la demanda del mercado. Sin embargo el sue\u00f1o de algunas es de aprender a elaborar pasteles y bocadillos y hacer manualidades. Esto se debe a que ellas quieren diversificar sus negocios para que as\u00ed no tengan que depender de una fuente de ingresos. El sue\u00f1o de otras es de pagar su cr\u00e9dito y poder sacar un pr\u00e9stamo que les ayude a comprar m\u00e1s ganado. \r\n\r\n<P>Este grupo de mujeres es muy entusiasta.

Due to her willingness to work, she learned how to make bread rolls, and through lots of practice and dedication, started to find new ways to produce various snacks. She found it difficult being a traveling saleswoman because most people have a distrust of eating food sold on the street.   Once customers sampled the taste of her sweet pastries, demand for her products increased and Ver\u00f3nica took advantage of this opportunity.  She is now well known in her community and her commitment to success continues.  She sells her products in the central market every weekend in order to maximize her profits.   Her work provides her with the opportunity to save towards starting a bakery and installing a soda fountain where she can continue fulfilling her customers\u2019 orders.  \r\n<p>\r\nVer\u00f3nica is now on her thirteenth loan with Microfinanzas PRISMA.

She will use the 1,000.00 Peruvian soles she is requesting to buy more yarn so she can increase the production of her handicrafts.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":449777,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Weaving","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To purchase yarn.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-16T12:20:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eusebia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:41Z","rounded_local_amount":168.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734940},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:25Z","rounded_local_amount":168.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124263},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":168.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960004},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":168.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992849},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:28Z","rounded_local_amount":168.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717637},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:30Z","rounded_local_amount":166.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751323}],"funded_date":"2009-12-16T12:59:38Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":166738,"name":"Pedirama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pedirama B. is from the city of Gango ozamiz City.
