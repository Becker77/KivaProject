She lives near the city of Chiclayo, a city well known for its commercial and transport activity.\r\n\r\nThe need to move ahead and help her children some 8 years ago led her to launch a business selling meals from her house.  She began with few utensils and little supplies and thanks to her effort, the business has grown.  At present, she already has a small restaurant where she waits on customers every day.  The majority are workers from the zone who come for lunch around lunch time.  The good flavors of her food and the amiability she displays towards her customers has resulted in the restaurant gaining favor.\r\n\r\nThe rise in demand has resulted in short supplies, affecting her service.  For that reason, Hilda wishes to buy more supplies and to expand her restaurant by buying tables and chairs. Then she will be able to prepare more plates of food.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She used to own a food sales business in which she made use of her culinary skills by preparing meals without the use of too much seasoning. Thus, her meals promoted good digestion for her patrons. However, her problem was that she was unable to pay rent for her business space. As a result, after finishing construction of her house, she got the idea of setting up a general store there. She has been in this business for almost 5 months now, during which time she has been drawing in customers, which makes her feel happy. She also supports her young children with their school work.

Her eldest daughter works as a waitress at the local restaurant and her next two daughters are attending a high school.\r\n\r\nIn 2006 Batsuuri started running a handicraft-making business. She buys sheep\u2019s wool, processes it and then makes Mongolian traditional handicrafts. She or her children sells them mostly to tourists. When summer comes she makes more handicrafts to sell tourists as many tourists come to visit Mongolia.\r\n\r\nWhen Batsuuri began running her business, her working capital was 50,000 tugrugs ($1 USD= 1450 MNT). As a result of her hard work, her business capital has increased 200,000 tugrugs. Besides running a handicraft business, to increase her family income, she plants vegetables on the land she owns. She requests a loan to buy raw material such as wool, wire and paint to increase her business

Ariendo is a system wherein poor people using wealthy people\u2019s farmland give cavans (sacks) of rice to the owner every harvest in payment. The amount depends on the agreement between both parties.\r\n\r\nBaltazara wishes to have her own land to farm someday on which her husband and her two sons will work. To start reaching that goal, she has no other choice for now but to continue to involve herself in the common practice of ariendo. The loan she is requesting will be used to start up this business for her family to be able to augment the income of her husband and two sons. With her loan assisting her farming business, someday she will be able to buy land of her own to

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She started her business eight years ago and, over the years, she has managed to position herself in the market.  In order to gain customers, she started out doing home visits and, once she had built up her customer base, she opened premises where she only had one chair and one mirror.

They have a 1 year-old son for whom they both dream of building a better future so that he grows up healthy, with the financial and social security that he deserves."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":776528,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy hairdressing supplies such as shampoo, rinses, massage products and work tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:33Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delsy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":69798},{"due_date":"2011-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76247},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":77709},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":79198},{"due_date":"2011-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80716},{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":82263},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83840},{"due_date":"2012-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":85447},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":87084},{"due_date":"2012-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":88753},{"due_date":"2012-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":90455},{"due_date":"2012-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":98490}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.39},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.93},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.74},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.56},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.4},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.24},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.11},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.9},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.39,"local_amount":69798,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":70059.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673775},{"amount":84.68,"local_amount":153956,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":154533.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188244},{"amount":426.93,"local_amount":776246,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:14Z","rounded_local_amount":779156.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650725}],"funded_date":"2011-06-04T16:31:20Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:42:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":307043,"name":"Ester","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"As a married parent of six children, Ester works hard to support her family. \r\n\r\nShe has a fish selling business in the Philippines, and also earns additional income from selling food and personal products.

Her future plan for her crops is to improve the yield.  With this loan, Rosa will purchase fertilizers and supplies to be able to improve her crops.  She thanks the lending institution for their support in these ten loan cycles, as it has helped her to make housing improvements and improve her crops.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kathleen O&#039;Connell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":381981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizers to be able to improve her crop yield","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-09-03T00:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":20000,"processed_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:05:23Z","rounded_local_amount":20506.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195765883}],"funded_date":"2009-09-17T15:53:56Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T11:05:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen O'Connell","image":578556}},{"id":138253,"name":"Gila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":" Gila G. is currently in the business of selling maize and sorghum  and is requesting a loan to purchase more maize to sell. <P>\r\n\r\n Gila is 30 years old and is married to a husband who is a businessman.

He is experienced in the business of making dried apricots.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Called chiya pasals, these tea shops make a sweet, milky tea that can be purchased for a few cents a cup.  With a Kiva loan, Patan BPW's borrowers are able to keep their store shelves stocked while increasing their profit margins by buying in greater volume.\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner microfinance institution, Patan Business and Professional Women (Patan BPW).

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has one child and her husband works as a security guard in the Chui electric power plant. He gave Guljan freedom of choice to choose between working and staying at home and Guljan chose to work. Her relatives advised her to engage in farming.\r\n\r\nGuljan managed to obtain a three-hectare (7.5-acre) piece of land and made a start by investing $50 in buying clover seeds. So, for ten years she has been growing clover. As many people have cattle and need to prepare forage for winter, Guljan quickly started making profits. Now, she trades in clover at the market.\r\n\r\nGuljan\u2019s work has been a great asset to her family\u2019s budget as, together with her husband, she has been able to buy a house in Tokmok city. Recently, Guljan harvested the clover and now needs some funds for fertilizing and working the land before winter comes. Therefore, she has applied for this loan as she does not have much time to collect a sufficient amount of money.\r\n\r\nGuljan\u2019s partners are Gulzina, Dinara and Sabyrbek:\r\n\r\nGulzina, 23, is married and her husband works at a tannery. Gulzina works on her land: she has one-hectare (2.5 acres) of land and grows hay. She has already harvested and stacked the hay and now is preparing to start selling it. Gulzina hopes to get this loan and invest it in working the land and fertilizing it.\r\n\r\nDinara, 43, is divorced. She plans to get engaged in animal husbandry. Her colleagues have advised her to start this occupation as it brings good profits. Dinara has applied for this loan to purchase a calf. Now, she is planning to equip her house with the necessary facilities.\r\n\r\nSabyrbek, 46, is a father of four children. His wife works at Kyrgyz Post as a logistics manager. Sabyrbek trades in cattle at \u201cMurok\u201d market and manages to earn $185 a month. Now, he needs to obtain this loan to invest it in purchasing cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b><p>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.<p><p>\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

She lives in the Reque district, located 15 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nFor more than a year she has sold food from the front of the house where she lives.  In the mornings she offers ceviche (a typical dish of the country), along with chips, tamales and pancakes, while in the evenings she sells traditional Peruvian desserts (arroz con leche -rice custard, mazamorra - purple corn pudding) in the park that is a block from her house.  This business enjoys a very good reception due to the flavorful food that she prepares.  \r\n\r\nThis business is also a big help to her and her family economically, as her parents are of an advanced age and they depend on the income that she earns to survive.  For this reason Elvira wants to expand her business with the purchase of more supplies that will allow her to prepare more food to offer her customers.  To do this she is requesting from Edpyme Alternativa a loan of 1,600 Peruvian soles that she will use to achieve this goal.\r\n\r\nElvira is a responsible woman who, day by day, works hard to get ahead.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nAlejandra is married and has 2 school-aged children. Alejandra owns & operates a specialized retail store where she sells fresh fish. Alejandra has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Alejandra joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Alejandra has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,000 PHP from GDMPC. Alejandra is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional fish to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Alejandra from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to supplement the daily needs of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Together they have 4 children. They have their own house where they live happily. Since he was a child his parents taught him to work on the farm, now he is a farmer and he has his own land where he grows cocoa trees. He has been working his own land for the past 15 years. During harvest times he has help from his children and other hired laborers to be able to pick the fruit more quickly. What he likes most about his work is harvesting his plants because he can see that his months of hard work have resulted in the reward of good fruit. The hardest thing is to transport his products from the farm to the warehouse that is located in the city of San Francisco; this is where he is able to get the best price for his grains and pineapples. His difficulty is that he does not have enough economic income to be able to cover the advance payments to the hired laborers that help him during the harvest. It is for this reason that he came to the institution of MFP. But right now what is of higher priority is to plant more cocoa trees in a hectare of uncultivated land that he has. This will be his first loan with MFP. Evaristo feels that the money from this loan will help him greatly in the progress of his work. In his community bank he is a member that is very well liked by the rest of the members; he is well integrated with them. With the loan of 1,500 nuevos soles he is going to buy cocoa trees, which will increase his production. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":981535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cocoa plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-17T21:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evaristo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":575}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":575,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1547.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451258}],"funded_date":"2012-01-18T19:24:01Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tricia Kell","image":809712}},{"id":413835,"name":"Met","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Met, 58, is widowed and resides with two children in Takeo Province, Cambodia.

Whereas the cups are purchased in the big open-air market of Sikasso from wholesalers who handle that sort of merchandise, the other articles are bought right where they live, in the market of Farakala and in the surrounding villages. Then they sell these articles in the village, either out of their homes or door-to-door and in the weekly markets of Farakala and  the surrounding villages. The sales are mostly for cash and occasionally for credit. Their clientele is essentially made up of women. <P>\r\n\r\nThey hope to make a monthly profit of 15,000 FCFA, which will be used to make payments on the loan with the remainder invested in their businesses.

and sacrifice their time to earn a living for the sake of their children. Likewise, Mrs. Charlita M., with her husband, Mr. Benjamin M., of Barangay Poblacion, Diadi, Nueva Vizcaya, are striving hard to support the education of their five children. Despite the economic crisis, they still have the strong faith and determination to uplift their standard of living and give their children a better future.\r\n\r\nThe couple earn a living through farming. They cultivate their farm by planting fruits and vegetables for two harvests. Since harvesting takes a long time, they need to have another source of income to finance the schooling of their children. In this regard, Charlita engaged in selling vegetables and fruit in their village. She sells them through house to house delivery and also to the market through retail. Every week, she earns a net income of Php 700 which they utilize to acquire their daily basic needs and for the schooling of their children.\r\n\r\nSince her weekly income is not sufficient for the needs of the family, Charlita wants to sell more vegetables to earn a higher income. In this regard, she wants to borrow additional capital of Php 5,000 from ASKI to be used in acquiring more products for her vending business. She hopes that, through the continuous support of ASKI, she will be able to improve her business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":410886,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits &

M. is 53 and lives with his wife and a granddaughter in the Villas de San Pablo development of the city of Barranquilla. He was able to acquire his house through a subsidy that he received from the state. This development is the first housing macroproject in Colombia lead by the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo in association with the local and national governments. Nelson is a bricklayer and has had a small hardware store in his home for 18 months, where he sells construction materials, electronic items and tools. In the beginning the inventory and sales were low, but they have grown month by month because each time there are more families living in the neighbourhood and almost all of them are remodeling their homes. He and his wife take turns working in the store. His wife also provides a landline and cell phone service. This is Nelson's first loan with the Fundacion, and he plans to invest it buying cement, bricks and laminates for roofs, and accessories for PVC tubes. These are the items that he sells the most. His daily sales average $120,000 COP and the margin of utility is 35%. Nelson says he is a lucky man because he has survived two serious motorcycle accidents that left him with various fractures. Today he is fully recovered and he has no lasting consequences. In the beginning of next year he will visit a son who lives in the city of Cali, and his wife will stay and look after the business for one week. In the near future he plans to build a second floor in his home to separate the living area from the business, thus improving their quality of

They have 4 children but only live with 2 of them.  They live in their own home which is located in the town of Perene (in the central Peruvian jungle).\r\n\r\nEsther is a mother who is committed to the progress of her children.  For 10 years she has been selling tamales.  She also grows crops such as bananas and cassava.  She tells us that she is well known for her work since she prepares the tamales that she sells door to door to local people herself.  She sells, on average, 50 units a day.  What Esther most likes about her work is the praise that she receives for her delicious seasoning. \r\n\r\nIn the mornings, Esther takes care of her crops which help her to cover some extra expenses.  Her purchasers come to her to buy her harvested crops.  Her main difficulty is paying for her children's university studies.  She is currently paying for the end of a degree course in mechanics for one of her children.\r\n\r\nEsther is a member of the 'Los So\u00f1adores' (The Dreamers) community bank and this is her third loan from MFP.  She feels grateful for the support that she receives from the members of her association.  Esther is planning to renew her crops.  She will use her loan to buy several small plants of different varieties of citrus fruits which she will graft so that she can obtain variety in her plantings."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":732850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy citrus fruit plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-03-18T14:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:00Z","rounded_local_amount":152.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196393},{"amount":55,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:42Z","rounded_local_amount":152.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270073},{"amount":55,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":152.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550090},{"amount":55,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":152.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718766},{"amount":55,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:33Z","rounded_local_amount":152.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350219},{"amount":55,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":152.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850711},{"amount":55,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:34Z","rounded_local_amount":152.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665916},{"amount":55,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:44Z","rounded_local_amount":152.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621079},{"amount":55,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:50:47Z","rounded_local_amount":152.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835281},{"amount":55,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:28Z","rounded_local_amount":152.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245051}],"funded_date":"2011-03-20T14:29:19Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":286601,"name":"Raul","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Ra\u00fal, de 50 a\u00f1os, es un hombre muy trabajador y alegre, vive en su casa propia junto a su esposa Ofelia de 35 a\u00f1os y sus 2 queridos hijos Jairo de 8 y Angy de 5 a\u00f1os, a quienes desea brindar una mejor calidad de vida.

hasil bercocok tanam khususnya tanaman jangka pendek seperti: padi, palawija dan sayur-sayuran. Begitu juga yang di tekuni oleh I Made Ardana. Meskipun tak memiliki lahan sendiri, suami dari Nyoman Desi ini juga sibuk mengurusi kebun sayur kacang panjang yang ditanam dilahan yang di dapatnya dari menegrjakan tanah orang lain dengan sistem bagi hasil. Tanah seluas kurang lebih 20 Are telah ditanami kacang panjang dan telah menyelesaikan panen pertama dan mendapatkan hasil yang cukup lumayan. Namun I Made Ardana merasa sangat kecewa karena dari hasil yang di dapatnya habis untuk mengembalikan modal yang dia dapat pinjam dari seseorang dengan bunga yang sangat tinggi. Untuk itulah untuk periode penanaman berikut ini I Made Ardana ingin bergabung dengan Dinari untuk meminjam  modal dengan sistem pengembalian di akhir periode    yaitu 6 bulan. Modal ini oleh I Made Ardana akan di pergunakan untuk membeli bibit, pupuk dan biaya \u2013biaya lain yang di perlukan dalam perawatan kebun sayurnya. Dengan begitu I Made Ardana bisa mendapat hasil yang lebih baik dan tentunya dapat merasakan hasil jerih payahnya.","en":"Most of the people in Taman village of Tuwed West Bali are farmers.

He will then get a part of the proceed from the farm.

Accommodation is also another problem for the children of D.E.C. The building is too small to accommodate the 535 pupils. Staff of D.E.C are working hard to meet these challenges; they are currently seeking assistance from the various N.G.Os in Koinadugu district. Fortunately, they are very grateful to VDC (Village Development Partnership, an NGO of former American Peace Corps), who are currently constructing them a three class-room building, the first to benefit from VDC in the Koinadugu district.<p> \r\n\r\nJuliet C. Conteh (2nd from right) is the Deputy Head Teacher of the school. Juliet is married to a soldier and the two of them have four children together. One of their children is in college, and the others are in Senior Secondary School (SSS) I, II and III. Juliet will divide her loan into three partitions: 1) to buy building materials 2) to pay school fees for her children and 3) to invest in business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":271683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy building materials, pay school fees and invest in business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Fadugu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"9.666667 -11.466667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-02-15T18:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juliet C.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mohamed A.w.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yakuba","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sylvanus S.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":2700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":270000},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":270000},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":270000},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":270000},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":270000},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":270000},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":270000},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":270000},{"due_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":270000},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":270000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":337500,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-17T07:56:41Z","rounded_local_amount":345825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20434530},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":202500,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:12:00Z","rounded_local_amount":207495,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025728},{"amount":157.5,"local_amount":472500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:55:07Z","rounded_local_amount":484155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008531},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":337500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:27:03Z","rounded_local_amount":345825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230868},{"amount":180,"local_amount":540000,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:17:45Z","rounded_local_amount":553320,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102874},{"amount":90,"local_amount":270000,"processed_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:03:51Z","rounded_local_amount":276660,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97019890},{"amount":90,"local_amount":270000,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:35:27Z","rounded_local_amount":276660,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103864735},{"amount":90,"local_amount":270000,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:37:43Z","rounded_local_amount":276660,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110754544}],"funded_date":"2009-02-16T01:52:51Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:37:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":93193,"name":"Casaorcco Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco Casaorcco inicia su cuarto ciclo con  17 socias, las socias son D. la comunidad D.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":430570,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow from CCT\u2019s Cooperative quite a few times. She consistently pays her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her business.     \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 14,000 loan. This loan will be used as a source of added capital for her expanding business. She will use the loan to buy ingredients and raw materials needed to produce her soaps and other products. She dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can have enough money to provide her child with a comfortable and stable life.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

Norberto has been engaged in his business for more than 15 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nNorberto joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities.

She lives with her husband and two daughters in Suburbio de Guayaquil, an urban area in which most of the residents are businesspeople.\r\n\r\nShe has been a midwife for a long time, and for that reason she was very interested in having a pharmacy as a business.  One of July's sisters taught her how to work in a pharmacy and lent her a shop in front of a maternity hospital.  She has been running the pharmacy in front of the hospital for fourteen years, and she sells diapers, antibiotics, flu remedies, etc.  She works from 6:00 am until 6:00 pm and sells the diapers for $0.25 each, serums at $1.50 and antibiotics at $0.20 per unit.\r\n\r\nWith the loan she wants to buy medicines like flu remedies and antibiotics as well as diapers, etc.  In the future July wants to stock her pharmacy with more medicines.

Boshi is 60 years old. He is married with 4 children. For more than 20 years, Boshi has arduously dedicated himself to the livestock business.

Your support will really help to Boshi and his family to get ahead.        \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
