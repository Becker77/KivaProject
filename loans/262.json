She has a clothes making workshop in her neighborhood of Los Olivos. She began this creative endeavor in 1986 with a household sewing machine that her mother gave her. Her current infrastructure consists of: her industrial sewing machine, tables, and a bookcase. Neida offers different product lines including a women\u2019s line, a men\u2019s line and a children\u2019s line. \n\nHer customers are housewives, employees and students. In general, first time customers always like everything she makes and return because she works with precision. She makes both cash sales and short term credit sales with her customers. \n\nThis is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo. With it she will purchase basic materials and supplies to complete clothing orders in women\u2019s, men\u2019s and children\u2019s lines. This will make her investment a success because she knows the market very well and will make clothing with this, on request.\n\nShe has a daughter who is 30 years old whom she hopes will always be happy and successful. Her goal is to have her own storefront that she can adapt and supply with casual clothing so as to impact the market. Her biggest challenge is expanding the physical infrastructure of her workshop. It is currently located in a room in her house. While she works toward her dreams, she has taken care to maintain a profit margin of no less than 40%, a 26 day inventory turnover time and a 35 day accounts receivable schedule.

She works with zeal as a resourceful parent to support her family and to provide for the children\u2019s schooling. She is a fishmonger and sells all kinds of fresh and smoked fish. She sells through \u201chawking\u201d (Door-to-door sales). She buys her goods from big time fish mongers in Yeji and Mankessim towns, who sell at wholesale prices. She has been in business for five years.

Someday, she hopes that she will be able to request a much bigger loan amount which will enable her to buy a new tricycle for better presentation, which will attract passengers\u2019 interest. The profits she will be making in this business will be the means for her to be able to send all of her children to school until graduation in college.

She requests a loan to purchase things she needs to start her beauty salon. \r\n\r\nShe would also like to buy merchandise to have a better variety and offer the best service. Her goal for the future is to give a better life to her children.

Together, they work every day to advance themselves. Beginning when he was very young, he learned everything about making clothing, since he watched how his parents carried out this work in the workshop in their house. It is in this way that at the age of 12 he began to help them, and now he works alongside his father creating garments to wear, according to the season. He is very satisfied with his work, since they themselves often sell the garments and the earnings are greater. In addition, they sell them to larger dealers. He likes his work a lot and can work through the entire day in the comfort of his home, although sometimes he has to get up at dawn to work with his parents to complete big orders. \r\n\r\nSince he is a very entrepreneurial young man, in the future he would like to expand the business, and he has already thought about buying sewing machines to hire operators and produce in quantity. \r\n\r\nThis is his first credit with MFP, and he promises to be punctual with his payments, since he wants to fulfill his obligations to the people who make possible this support, which will allow him to continue working in search of progress.

Estrelita is separated from her spouse and has four adult-age children. To earn a living, Estrelita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector. Specifically, she runs a general store, where her primary source of income is derived from selling both food and everyday products to members of her local community. Estrelita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4,500 PHP per month from these activities. <p>\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Estrelita joined ASKI to gain much-needed access to financial services. As a result, she was better able to engage in business activities and to thereby improve her standard of living. Recently, Estrelita successfully repaid a previous loan in the amount of 10,000 PHP ($250) from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Estrelita is now requesting another loan, again in the amount of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Notably, this loan would be the third loan taken out by Estrelita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business as a result of the loan to financially support her immediate family members. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas.

Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the Philippines a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries, and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 500 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 30,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nGliceria hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her family a good future through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners.

They have 4 children who all now lives separately with their own family. Their home is made out of hollow brick and rough cement. To face their daily lives, Ni Wayan Twi works on farming pigs. With her current capital she has 2 pigs, which she sells after 4 months for each around Rp. 250.000 to  Rp. 300.000. However this is barely sufficient to buy pig feedings on top of their daily expenses which is around Rp. 20.000. \r\n\r\nAfter receiving training and finance from Dinari, Ni Wayan Twi intends to grow her business. She intends to buy piglets and build a bigger pig sty. She estimates that her piglets outputs will increased by 8-10. And with the training provided, she will be able to gain more profit. She has also made plans on saving and paying back her loans. Ni Wayan Twi hopes that her business will be succesful.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa by Bernard, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nNi Wayan Twi, 50 tahun, tinggal bersama suaminya, I Wayan Sidia, dirumahnya yang sederhana di sebuah desa Hindu di Bali Barat. Mereka memiliki 4 orang anak, namun saat ini keempat anaknya sudah berkeluarga dan tinggal dengan keluarganya masing \u2013 masing. Rumah mereka semi permanen, terbuat dari dinding batako dan lantai semen kasar. Untuk mencukupi kebutuhan hidup sehari \u2013 hari, Ni Wayan Twi menekuni usaha beternak babi. Dengan modal yang dimilikinya sekarang, 2 ekor anak babi, Ni Wayan Twi bisa menjualnya setelah dipelihara 4 bulan. Per ekor dijual dengan harga Rp. 250.000.- s \/ d Rp. 300.000.- Hasil tersebut dirasakan sangat minim, karena masih harus dikurangi dengan biaya pakan dan juga harus memenuhi kebutuhannya sehari \u2013 hari yang mencapai Rp. 20.000.-\r\nSetelah mendapat pembinaan cara beternak babi yang baik dari yayasan Dinari, Ni Wayan Twi ingin meningkatkan usahanya. Dengan pinjaman yang didapatnya, Ni Wayan Twi berencana untuk membeli seekor induk yang sudah siap dikawinkan. Untuk itu, ia juga menggunakan pinjaman untuk membangun kandang baru yang lebih baik dan besar untuk anak babinya nanti. Dengan menambah populasinya, perhitungan Ni wayan Twi, induk babinya akan beranak 8 s \/ d 10 ekor. Dalam perawatan dan pemeliharaan selama 4 bulan, penjualan babinya akan mendapatkan hasil yang lebih banyak dari sebelum ia mendapat pelatihaan dan pinjaman modal. Ni Wayan Twi juga sudah memperhitungkan untuk menyisihkan keuntungan yang ia akan dapatkan untuk modal dan juga untuk mengembalikan pinjamannya nanti. Ni Wayan Twi berharap usahanya akan sukses, pinjamannya bisa dilunasi dan ia akan bisa mandiri dengan usahanya"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":81659,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Membeli induk dan membuat kandang -

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed not credit worthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.pSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from the said client, extending a loan to her, and then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called sale and leaseback

belongs to the group \"Sin Fronteras\" (Without Borders), which is maD. up of friends and tradespeople like her.  When she was single she always worked for other people and for some companies.  She left those jobs in order to dedicate herself to her small children and her family.  With the passage of time her children grew and she looked for a way to earn money.  She started selling a little bit of everything; now that the school season is approaching she is making lunchboxes for children.  She has a lot of orders for this product so she must work very hard to fulfill them for her customers.  In addition, she buys clothing wholesale and sells it to her friends and relatives.  They buy from her because she allows them to pay in installments.  Now she does not have a stable place where she can display her products, but in the near future she wants to have another type of business. She wants to get into the business of children's parties.  She has space in her home to carry out this activity, and now she is saving in order to start up this business.  She will accomplish this through the loan granted by EDAPROSPO, which will be used to buy materials to make a lot of lunchboxes.  \r\n\r\n*Angela is in the middle of the seated members of the group; she is smiling and is wearing a cherry red blouse.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3175,"image":{"id":475840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials to make lunchboxes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3175,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eusebia Petronila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ysabel Amparo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Consuelo Del Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julissa Carmela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susy Araceli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Milena De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":9100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2275},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2275},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2275},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2275}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":793.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":793.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":793.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":793.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":793.75,"local_amount":2275,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:46:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2282.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123899705},{"amount":793.75,"local_amount":2275,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":2282.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128933788},{"amount":793.75,"local_amount":2275,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:08:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2282.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136661381},{"amount":793.75,"local_amount":2275,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2282.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144694043}],"funded_date":"2010-02-15T11:44:19Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:06:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":175185,"name":"Sam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In this tough economy, Sam was looking for an opportunity to provide for his family\u2019s financial security, but he never imagined that he would find inspiration while walking through the mall one afternoon.\r\n\r\nSam is the owner of BouncyLand, an indoor children\u2019s play space and recreation zone located inside a suburban shopping mall. \u201cSince we opened, I\u2019ve enjoyed watching the families come and have a good time together.

The loan he is applying for is for his wife, who sells food in Achumani, since she cannot consent to a loan because she is of advanced age. Her husband helps her with the sale of food, the business activity that is being evaluated. With this activity, they maintain their home, and they have always showed responsibility and punctuality in their payments, in spite of their being of advanced age. But it's clear that they still have much strength, and it was for this reason that it was decided to give them the Kiva rate. The loan money will be used for the formalities for their home.

Leoncia has been engaged in her business for over four years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Leoncia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. As with her previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI which she has successfully repaid, this new loan of 12,000 PHP will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the fourth loan that Leoncia has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Her first loan was repaid in full paying most of her installments ahead of time which shows that Inocencia is responsible and punctual with payments.\r\n\r\nThis family of hard working spouses has very good personal references.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":769771,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy nutritionally balanced cattle feed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Tambogrande - Piura","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2011-06-01T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Luisa Inocencia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":70.01},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":69.24},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":76.37},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":76.12},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":77.89},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":82.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":84.01},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":86.81},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":90.12},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":92.09},{"due_date":"2012-03-19T07:00:00Z","amount":96.42},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":98.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.97},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.64},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.54},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.21},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.98},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.51},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.55},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.8},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.53},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.22,"local_amount":139.25,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:53:50Z","rounded_local_amount":144.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216489558},{"amount":28.64,"local_amount":76.37,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:45:07Z","rounded_local_amount":79.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222205718},{"amount":28.54,"local_amount":76.12,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":78.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227182456},{"amount":29.21,"local_amount":77.89,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:46:09Z","rounded_local_amount":80.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232779422},{"amount":30.98,"local_amount":82.62,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-19T08:56:46Z","rounded_local_amount":85.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238583972},{"amount":31.51,"local_amount":84.01,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-04T09:08:46Z","rounded_local_amount":87.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244542166},{"amount":173.9,"local_amount":463.74,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-02T09:04:59Z","rounded_local_amount":480.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250752741}],"funded_date":"2011-06-02T03:31:45Z","paid_date":"2012-02-02T09:04:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":302654,"name":"Jocelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is Jocelyn, 53, a resident of Pasay City, Philippines.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n<br>Jocelyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy a sachet of shampoo, 5 PHP-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Jocelyn earns an income by purchasing supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her regular customers are her neighbors and members of the local community. Her store is open 24 hours a day, unlike other stores in the community. She also sells repacked charcoal as an alternative to LPG for cooking and she also has e-load phone credits for sale at her store. She earns a minimum of 1,200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<br>To help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 50,000 PHP loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and e-load credits to increase her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n<br>Jocelyn hopes to find a good location for her business and eventually be a dealer of grocery and other products in her community. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n<p>\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay microfinance

She is married to Chen and has one lovely child living under her care. This couple is working hard toward their dreams: they want to secure their family from poverty and develop their business more successfully for the future.  \r\n\r\nMrs. Vann is a hog raiser. She has been involved in this business for 4 years, that\u2019s why she has enough skill to fatten up her pigs rapidly and avoid her pigs from illness.

He does not live with a partner nor has any children or dependent relatives. After finishing high school, he started university but had to drop out before completing his first year because of his lack of financial resources. He was living with his parents but they decided to stop supporting him in order to help him become independent. Deybi then rented a room in the Quintanilla - Sacaba - Chapare area and started living on his own. He has been working in urban transport for two years. He works Monday to Saturday as a taxi driver, and is member of a taxi network called \"L\u00ednea dorada\" (\"Golden Line\").

Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and is a challenging place in which to live because it is a very mountainous area (the altituD. ranges from 2,000 \u2013 5,000 meters above sea level), it is very cold, it is a difficult place to grow crops, and the area lacks an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems. BCR \u201cVilla Pachamarca\u201d is located approximately 2,500 meters above sea-level in the community of Pachamarca and the province of Churcampa. The small town of Pachamarca is at the end of a road that winds through the mountains, but the road is not continuous and, as a result, transportation is very limited.\r\n<p>\r\nThe main activities of the people in the region are related to agriculture. The valley of Pachamarca has an excellent climate for agricultural purposes because of the relatively low altituD. and the availability of water throughout the year. In fact, the climate makes it possible to grow a great variety of fruits and vegetables such as corn, beans, tara, avocado, pacay, lucuma, banana, cherries, oranges, cucumber, carrots, and lettuce. In addition to cultivating all of the aforementioned foods, most people dedicate a good portion of their time to raising small animals such as guinea-pigs, chickens, ducks, and rabbits, as well as bigger animals such as cows and bulls. \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, the bank is starting its first loan cycle with 12 female borrowers and a total loan of 5,900 soles (approximately $2,100). The individual loans range from 200, 500, and up to 600 soles. As the group is just starting its first cycle, the group was not able to save money except for the initial loan to start their operations, but all of the group members agree to save in the future. The members of the new village bank have various hopes and dreams by virtue of the requested loans, ranging from their desire to be trained in marketing (e.g., how to improve their business with better marketing) and to receive technical assistance in raising small animals like guinea-pigs, rabbits, and chickens (e.g., how to avoid diseases).\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the members of the community bank is Marcelina L. P.. Marcelina is seeking a loan of 600 soles and she has been elected the \u201cpresident\u201d of the new village bank. She runs a small restaurant where she also sells clothes and soft drinks. With the proceeds from her loan she will increase her merchandise by purchasing more clothes, soft drinks, and meat. Moreover, she raises guinea-pigs. Marcelina\u00b4s dream for the future is to utilize her farm for raising guinea-pigs and rabbits, to have a bigger (and better) restaurant, and to make improvements to her house. Further, due to her involvement with FINCA Peru, she would like to learn and to continue saving so that she can improve her business.\r\n<p>\r\nBy way of further example, another group member is Paulina S. B., who has her own shop in town; in reality, Paulina's shop is more of a mini-market where she sells almost everything: tools for the kitchen and for cooking, all kinds of groceries, and shoes (her husband has a shoe-repair shop!). With the proceeds from the 600 soles loan she is seeking she would like to buy more goods for her shop. Much like Marcelina, Paulina hopes that her experience with FINCA Peru will teach her to save more money and to be more financially responsible in order to pay back her loan. The loan she is seeking will be used to pay for her children's education because her dream is to see to it that her children become professionals!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":158219,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional supplies for the group members' various businesses","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-05-11T17:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Herlinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Santa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Damitila Adelayda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mirian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol Imelda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Epifania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-05-26T04:49:06Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":983.33},{"due_date":"2008-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":983.33},{"due_date":"2008-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":983.33},{"due_date":"2008-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":983.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":983.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":983.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":983.33,"processed_date":"2008-06-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:00:17Z","rounded_local_amount":988.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":249216},{"amount":350,"local_amount":983.33,"processed_date":"2008-07-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:02:44Z","rounded_local_amount":988.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":277865},{"amount":350,"local_amount":983.33,"processed_date":"2008-08-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:06:22Z","rounded_local_amount":988.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":307346},{"amount":350,"local_amount":983.33,"processed_date":"2008-09-26T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-08T07:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":988.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":338410},{"amount":350,"local_amount":983.33,"processed_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-28T07:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":988.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":371960},{"amount":350.01,"local_amount":983.35,"processed_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:49:28Z","rounded_local_amount":988.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5314353}],"funded_date":"2008-05-12T04:49:06Z","paid_date":"2009-01-21T03:10:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":51874,"name":"Monika","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Monika Ale, 33, is married with 5 children.

He is married and has two beautiful sons who are 6 and 9 years old.  His wife works in sales at a market in Managua.  Manuel has a horse cart which he uses to provide transportation services.  He spends all day at the market waiting for customers.  He has ten years of experience, and started out selling fire wood using his cart.  He was then able to buy his horse with his savings.  The request he is making is to build a room on his small house, as he would like to expand to have more space and to be able to live more comfortably.  He needs to buy sand, cement and stone, among other items, for this renovation.  Long term, he wants to make improvements to his cart to continue providing his services at the market as they are very useful to those who come to the market to make purchases.  He would also like to continue making improvements to his house.    <p><br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":200722,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Finish construction on his house.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-09-09T18:20:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manuel Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-23T19:41:53Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":555.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31,"local_amount":563.64,"processed_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-28T07:05:25Z","rounded_local_amount":605.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":369289},{"amount":30.11,"local_amount":547.48,"processed_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-15T18:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":587.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5281379},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:54:47Z","rounded_local_amount":596.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9893206},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:21:06Z","rounded_local_amount":596.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816283},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:22:30Z","rounded_local_amount":596.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20350990},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:08:06Z","rounded_local_amount":596.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038308},{"amount":30.55,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:44:37Z","rounded_local_amount":596.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35928611},{"amount":30.56,"local_amount":555.56,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":596.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44383551},{"amount":30.54,"local_amount":555.52,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:28:41Z","rounded_local_amount":596.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890043}],"funded_date":"2008-09-09T19:41:53Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T16:28:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":68275,"name":"Pasi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Pasi L., 35, is married with 4 children.

With this loan she will buy polo shirts at wholesale prices, cosmetics and jewelry to have in stock and offer to her clients.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":258473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase her merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-19T23:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.62},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":127.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423650},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:32:54Z","rounded_local_amount":127.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116919},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:43:07Z","rounded_local_amount":127.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011840},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:53Z","rounded_local_amount":127.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595434},{"amount":40.63,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:38:21Z","rounded_local_amount":127.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989681},{"amount":40.58,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-07-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":127.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210802},{"amount":40.62,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:36Z","rounded_local_amount":127.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640423},{"amount":40.66,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":127.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080091}],"funded_date":"2009-01-20T00:09:58Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:29:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Crouch","image":59003}},{"id":88757,"name":"Sauda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (Greetings!) from Tanzania! Sauda N. is 31 years old and from Mbeya. She is married with 3 children, between the ages of 3 and 14. Sauda has been running a retail shop business since 2006. Her business is purchasing basic home commodities and reselling them.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business 9 hours per day, and 6 days per week. Sauda currently earns about $120 a month from her business. She is requesting a loan of 525 USD in order to purchase items like sugar, soap, rice, and other basic home needs to sell in her shop. In the future, she plans to start a new business as well. Sauda graciously thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":270898,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Mothers usually drop their children off at 7 or 8 in the morning, when they leave their homes in order to earn a living. Digmelia equipped the back part of her house with educational games that she uses to both entertain and teach the children, which stimulates learning. However, she does not work alone; she has two young assistants who also look after the children very affectionately. In the future, Digmelia would like to expand her nest and hire more staff so that the mothers can rest assured that their children are in good hands.  <p>\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP.

selling is a tried and tested alternative source of income for many Filipino housewives, and Annalyn G., 27 years old, is one of them.  She lives with her family in Silang, Cavite.  Annalyn is married to Joel, 26, a maintenance worker.\r\n \r\nAnnalyn started with her direct selling of cosmetics and apparel only last year.  She did this to augment the meager income from the operation of their motorized tricycle.  She now earns close to P14,000 a month, especially during peak months nearing the Christmas season.  From her profits, she was able to purchase a brand new washing machine for the family and she was able to renovate their kitchen sink.  \r\n\r\nIn 2007, she joined the Center for Community Transformation (CCT) Credit Cooperative.  She is applying for a loan in the amount of P12,000 so she can purchase more items to sell.  \r\n\r\nShe is working hard to help her husband cover their basic daily needs.  She dreams of seeing her family living in their own house and on their own lot soon.  She dreams of having her own service center for cosmetics and apparel.  She also hopes to acquire a car for the family.\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\nAbout CCT\r\n\r\nThe Center for Community Transformation (CCT) is an organized Christian response against poverty and social injustice.  This is carried out through the fusion of social development initiatives and evangelical mission in a uniquely Filipino context.  It serves urban and rural poor communities throughout the Philippines, in pursuit of its desire to see changed lives, strong families, and transformed communities centered in the Lordship of Jesus Christ.  \r\n\r\nCCT is a member of the Five Talents family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":410925,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"additional capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silang, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Annalyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.54}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":150330,"name":"Dupe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dupe sells drinks, chemicals and insecticides in her stall.

They have five children who are between the ages of 10 mos. and 23 years old. \r\n\r\nCherelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she wanted for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Cherelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of 9,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of $420, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 4th cycle loan, she is borrowing 14,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional working capital for improving and expanding her general store (sari-sari shop) and her computer gaming business so that she can continue to save up for a brighter future and for the education of her children.

She is 35 years old, lives with her partner, and has two children.  Her eldest child lives independently and her youngest is in elementary school.\r\n\r\nRosa Mercedes has always enjoyed earning her own income to help her husband, who works in the house-building trade, with their household expenses and the education expenses of their eldest child.  She used the first loan that she received through her community bank to buy fruit which she sold on the sidewalk outside her house.  Things went well for a year, until the competition opened a grocery store in which they also started selling fruit and vegetables.  For this reason, she decided to change business and she now hires out a motorcycle taxi.  She receives payment every day and is thereby able to save.  She also has time to spend on other tasks such as looking after children in her home.  In this way, Rosa Mercedes works hard, day by day, alongside her husband, so that they can get ahead and make their dreams come true.\r\n\r\nRosa Mercedes will use this loan for 2,000 soles to have her vehicle serviced and make a down payment to acquire another one.  This will allow her to make more profits and save up so that she can finish building her house.  Rosa Mercedes is a tenacious woman who has a great desire to continue learning.  Her dream is to finish building her home and to set up a store where she will sell fruit from every region in Peru.

She is in a committed relationship with Jhonny who is a fisherman, with whom she lives along with her two children of 10 and 3 years of age, her sister-in-law and two nephews, inhabiting her own home. The business Liliana has is selling the fish that her partner fishes in the area's lakes such as Yarinacocha Lake.

Another portion of it she sells retail at a fish stand she has at the port. \r\n\r\nShe relies only upon her partner's support in this business, which she has had for ten years.

He is 41 years old and is married.  He went to school until the 4th grade in the old system due to the lack of conditions of his parents.  He is the father of 4 children with ages between 7 months and 13 years old.  The 4 oldest kids go to school, and the youngest is a newborn.\r\n\r\nBenedito left Gaza for Maputo alleging that he was going to study.  Having arrived in Maputo he began to work work with his father as a mason.  Years later he moved with his family to Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland.  He started doing local work as a mason, but because his work does not pay very well in Mozambique he emigrated to South Africa.  Today he is in charge, and he works on a contract base.\r\n\r\nOver ten years ago he opened a stand in his home.  Since he works far from home and is not able to satisfy the needs of his family he thought this was the best way to help his wife while he is away.  He has visited his family 3 times in 3 months.\r\n\r\nHis business has a positive impact on the community and he is unable to satisfy the demands of his customers.  He approached hluvuku and solicited a loan for 15,000MT to increase his inventory.  His best product is beer.  He buys a case for 250 and resells it for 330.  A 25kg sack of rice costs 500 and is resold for 600.  He has had monthly receipts of 3,000MT and is able to save 1,000MT per month.  He is also responsible for his parents who live with him in his house.\r\n\r\nBenedito already had a loan from a bank, and he paid it without difficulty.  This is his first with Hluvuku and with Kiva, which he will use to purchase staple products for resale.  He is confident that he will be able to pay off this loan without problems.  Even if he is absent his wife will pay.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva

She is a 41-year-old woman with a live-in partner and one dependent son. She states that she started out by selling provisions in her general store, a business that she has been managing for several years now. She got started by saving money little by little, selling Esika and Oriflame beauty products. Aside from this business, she also works as a salesperson at a clothing boutique. As we can see, Rosita generates her own income through different jobs in order to help her family get ahead. Her friends and neighbors know her well, and since she is very welcoming, business is booming. With this 2,000.00 PEN loan, she will purchase goods like: sacks of rice and sugar, crates of milk, cooking oil, crates of soft drinks (different sizes and flavors), household cleaning supplies, and personal hygiene products. Thus, she can keep her customers satisfied. She feels good about the work that she is doing, and she believes that the sacrifice is worth it because she can reach her life goals and dreams. She would also like to thank the Manuela Ramos Movement for giving support to her and to other women who wish to get ahead in life. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":351523,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":" Purchase goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-07-14T06:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":343.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63206175},{"amount":112.61,"local_amount":333.67,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:51:54Z","rounded_local_amount":344.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635430},{"amount":112.39,"local_amount":332.99,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:49:10Z","rounded_local_amount":343.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074506},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":343.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989845},{"amount":112.62,"local_amount":333.68,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:42:37Z","rounded_local_amount":344.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103834789},{"amount":112.38,"local_amount":333,"processed_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:34Z","rounded_local_amount":343.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110726723}],"funded_date":"2009-07-27T05:38:25Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:07:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":125637,"name":"Thuoc","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Thu\u1ed9c L\u00ea T. was born in 1959.

Elenita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from HSPFI. Elenita is requesting a new loan of 17,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Elenita from HSPFI.

She earns her living by operating a business buying and selling firewood\/charcoal. Her husband Paulino, who is 58 years old, works as a construction worker to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are between 18 and 36 years old. Three of their children have their own families and one has her own job and helps her parents run the business. Lydia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lydia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, to buy firewood and charcoal for resale so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business. Lydia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \n\nIn the accompanying photo, Lydia poses with the stacks of firewood that she

For this reason, Jorge has requested a loan of 2000 Peruvian soles from Edpyme Alternativa. \r\n\r\nJorge\u2019s taxi service has been quite profitable and he plans in the near future to purchase his own taxicab, which will be the start of a small fleet of cabs he hopes to own and manage. Jorge is very hard-working and responsible. He has had loans from Edpyme Alternativa in the past and repaid his debt on time. Thanks to his past loans and the income from his business, Jorge was able to purchase a small plot of land where he constructed his house.

The centers are in the cities of San Franscisco and Quimbirii, where she gets good payment for the grains she produces.  \r\n\r\nShe has some land that she does not cultivate.

With this loan she will buy seed, fertilizer and pesticides. \r\nHer goal for the future is to to expand into cattle because the market is favorable for cattle right now. Alicia is married, has 3 children and owns her home. Though she never went to school and cannot read or write she knows education is important and works hard to send her children to school. The youngest one is 4 years old and will be ready to enter school next year.Alicia's village is nestled right against the side of the Santa Maria volcano, part of a complex of volcanoes that regularly rumbles  and that completely destroyed the village in the early 20th century. It's a place of beautiful green hillsides and lush plots of corn and vegetables, all divided into little sections called cuerdas. The poorer women often rent just one cuerda and try to grow their own corn for the family and sell some vegetables from it. Those who have more sometimes own two or more cuerdas, and sometimes rent even more. It's hard work, and they always refer to their life as a \"battle\" or \"struggle\", but they continue with the battle to feed their families and keep the kids in school.\r\nWritten by Nancy Lewis and

He takes his livestock to the pastures every morning for nourishment. Then, after caring for them for several months, he takes them to be sold, but this phase is complicated due to transportation issues.

Her first loan for 300 PEN allowed her to buy products for the sale of her \u00e0 la carte meals.\r\n\r\nEncarna currently needs a loan for 3,000 PEN.  She will use part of the money to buy items for her convenience store.  She will use the other part to buy material to fix her business\u2019 floor.  That way she will be able to give her customers better service. \r\n\r\nEncarna\u2019s goal is to set up her store and to have a greater variety of products to get more customers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":428865,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy items for her convenience store and material to fix her business' floor","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Pucallpa-Ucayali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:01:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Encarna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:06:20Z","rounded_local_amount":502.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727837},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:05:38Z","rounded_local_amount":502.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118118219},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:43:38Z","rounded_local_amount":502.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123953933},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-23T07:54:15Z","rounded_local_amount":502.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987000},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:56:10Z","rounded_local_amount":502.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713122},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:27Z","rounded_local_amount":502.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746325}],"funded_date":"2009-12-27T03:24:21Z","paid_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":158641,"name":"Akwal","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Akwal M. is currently in the business of selling charcoal at home and is requesting a loan to purchase more bags of charcoal to sell.

They decided on this name because at the time there was a soap opera that featured a group of young women known as \u201cLas Populares.\u201d  It\u2019s also because [its members] are very well known in their neighborhood.  Development groups consist of more than ten people.  The group has a bank account and its members are required to meet every one or two weeks to make their payments.  The group is run by a representative and by a committee.  This group has 14 members and is located in the L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas community of the City of Jungapeo, Michoacan. \r\n\r\nThe group\u2019s representative is named Rosa Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez M..

She then decorates them with colors and designs.\r\n\r\nRosa sells her crafts to her acquaintances and has been running her business for five months.  She tells us that she enjoys her work.  Her customers say that she is a hard working and enterprising woman with a desire to come out ahead.  Her goals are to help her children get ahead and that they continue with their educations.  She also tells us that she would like to have a steady business so that she can use her income to buy school supplies and uniforms for her children for the upcoming school year.

Her customers know her as being a hard working woman who helps her husband with the household expenses, and as a good saleswoman because she gives them good prices.  Isabel requested this loan so that she could grow her shoe and clothing business.  She will buy items in different colors and sizes so that she will have them on have when her customers request them and not have to order them.

Mary Ann is a high school graduate and is married to Luis, a driver. Together they are raising four children, two of whom are still in school. Their family currently resides in Tanza, Cavite.\r\n\r\nOwning a piggery requires a lot of effort and Mary Ann recognizes this. Every day she has to make sure the piglets are given the right nutrition, stay in a good environment, and has the right suitable conditioning. She considers all these factors to make sure the piglets produce well. She also continuously seeks ways to improve the piggery. Mary Ann has been managing this business for 11 years, and makes a net income of around Php11,350 each month.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue  the operations of her piggery, Mary Ann is requesting a loan for Php 27,000.  She will use this loan to purchase feeds for her piglets and materials to renovate her piggery. Included in the list of items to buy are hollow blocks, cement, and wood. She says that the profits will be used as additional investment in the future. \r\n\r\nOne challenge Mary Ann faces is when the pigs get sick.  She is also concerned about her children, as lately they have become disobedient when it comes to attending school. But Mary Ann is maximizing every resource she has at hand to make sure she arrives at the results she wanted. She dreams of becoming prosperous and raising her piggery to the next level. Of course, it is also her dream to see her children finish their education and have a career of their own someday, because the bottom line is that she cares and loves her children most. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":778803,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

He has three children, and his wife works as a teacher at the local school.  Since 1981, Omar's family has been successfully involved in breeding livestock and farming.  Having started with a purchase of one cow, Omar was able to grow the livestock headcount to four cows and five sheep.  He also has 2.5 tons of corn for the next sale.  Profits from this business allowed Omar to buy a car for his family.  In order to further increase livestock headcount, Omar requested a loan in the sum of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase a dairy cow.  He intends to use the planned profit to build a new barn in order to provide good conditions for keeping
