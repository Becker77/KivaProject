They live in the Laureles Sur neighborhood, a heavily populated neighborhood of Managua that police records show to be one of the city's most crime-ridden.\r\n\r\nThe business hasn't generated much income over the last few month because sales have been lower than expected.  Iccel is applying for a loan so that she can refinance the business.  She expects to buy better merchandise and, in turn, increase the store's sales volumes.  This loan will greatly help the M. family in the future by helping them to generate the income they need to make improvements to their house, improvements that will contribute to making them safer in a neighborhood that is not very safe.

For the past 6 years, he has been selling beauty products from a well-known international brand. To sell his products wholesale, he travels to visit established clients in different provinces. For this reason, he is very happy in his work, although it is not typical for a man to be involved in the sale of such products. This does not seem to cause him any difficulties and it is thanks to this job that he is able to provide for the costs of his home. In the future, he would like to continue improving his business and sales, since he hopes to become a successful businessman. At present, he is building his own home, in which he hopes one day to establish his business. This is the second loan he has requested from MFP. He has always been responsible in making his payments on time. Isidro is planning to invest the money he has requested in purchasing a large amount of beauty products wholesale. He will then travel and distribute these products, since he already has various pending orders. In this way, he hopes to continue working in search of progress. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cameron Graham, Kiva

a general store. She offers a variety of products in their community including rice. Cristina has been engaged in her business for more than two years and earns approximately 2500 Philllipine pesos (PHP) a month for these activities. With this she was able to help her husband to support the educational needs of their child who is attending school. The family happily lives at the village of Allinguigan 3rd. At the age of 27, Cristina says that she has a lot of dreams for her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Cristina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Cristina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Cristina is requesting a new loan of 9000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Cristina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Dustmurod is 50 years old, married and has six children. He has secondary school education and has an animal husbandry business. He has a small cow shed where he breeds calves. Because he does not have a specialized education, animal husbandry is the only source of income for his family. \r\n\r\nDustmurod buys calves on the market at a low price, feeds them and then resells them at the same market at a more profitable price. He provides the market with meat and his family with the necessary food. Dustmurod wants to buy more cows and needs money so he decided to apply for a loan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has suffered terribly in the hands of ill health; poverty has been her major difficulty in life, and the inability to raise capital for business projects. She plans to invest this loan in her marketing business in which she plans to buy and sell clothes and assorted dresses for resale. She believes the business will succeed because she has been in the business for a long time. She also thinks her approach to her customers will be welcoming and hence lead to the success of her business. She has also put in place factors that will ensure the success of her business like getting her business advertised at cheaper rates. With this loan she will be able to support her community firmly in improving their standard of living and social interaction, not forgetting decent appearance. The inhabitants of her locality will also benefit from low transportation costs which would have been incurred in distant places.\r\n\r\nJustine will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to expand her business and save for rainy days.

GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

Her husband, F. S., is a laborer by profession. He is a very hard worker and his work involves a lot of physical energy. He is still very active at the age of 55. \r\n\r\nSafooran has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her son\u2019s barber shop. With the loan, her son will buy scissors and hair-related products such as creams, gels and colors to provide better services to the clients. He has been doing this business for the past four years and Safooran is hopeful that this investment will prove successful for his business.\r\n \r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her third loan application. In previous years, she has proved herself as a very responsible client who paid her installments on time and never missed any meetings.\r\n \r\nNote: In the photo, the lady who is holding a book

She earns her living by operating a sari-sari store and a fried chicken business. She has one child who is 6 years old. Belinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Belinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 56,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 20,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell to continue to save up for the future to repair their house and for her children\u2019s education. Belinda is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is 40 years old. Raulina is married and has 6 school-aged children. To make a living, Raulina owns and operates a \"sari-sari\" or general store where she sells a variety of products in the local community. Raulina has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Raulina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Raulina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Raulina is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Raulina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions and support the education of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":381566,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

of Brgy. Palaka Norte, in the town of Pulupandan, Negros Occidental. She's reaching for her dreams through hard work, patience, self-discipline, and the determination to move away from poverty. As a young girl, she dreamed of having her own business someday.\r\n<P>\r\nRutchell grew up going from town to town with her parents selling dried fish during the town market day. She learned how to deal with customers, how to sell, and how to handle money from her parents. When she got married, she decided to put up her own dried fish vending business. With the help of her husband and a little capital, they started selling dried fish in their community.<P>\r\n\r\nNeeding more capital to expand her business moved Rutchel to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997. With more capital available, she was able to start going to different towns during their market day, exponentially increasing her income. After her 3rd cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rutchell decided to further supplement her family's income potential by opening a general store as an additional source of income. Over the next 10 years, her business provided well for her young family, and she now earns on an average PHP 16,400 per month, which is used to pay for the education of her 4 children, cover the family's household expenses, and set aside some savings for the future of her children.\r\n<P>\r\nRutchell has been an NWTF-Project Dungganon member in good standing for the last 12 years and her last loan of PHP 29,500 was paid in full with no delays in weekly installments. For this 17th loan, Rutchell is again borrowing PHP 29,500 which she intends to use as revolving working capital for her dried fish business and the general store. The profits from this loan will continue to fund the education of her children and provide for the family's household expenses.<P>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: <P>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":390508,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

Thanks to its location, the area enjoys great natural beauty and biodiversity. Its adult population works in agriculture and ranching, while the young people work in the city or have migrated abroad to provide a better life for their families. \r\n\r\nLigia V., a member of the \"3 Mar\u00edas\" communal bank, lives near the highway to Punta Corral. She is 34 years old, married and the mother of four children, aged 16, 14, 12 and 10. Her oldest son studies at Unedid School, her second son at Miguel Merch\u00e1n School, her daughter at Herlinda Toral School, and her youngest child at the Yanuncay Educational Center. Her husband is a carpenter who traveled abroad many years ago to strive for a better present and future for his family. They do not yet have their own home, so they live at her mother's house. \r\n\r\nLigia has worked as a seamstress in her own shop for the past fifteen years. She offers alterations to every type of clothing, and she also sews blouses, skirts, and pants; but the garment she makes most often is the \"bolsicon,\" a traditional skirt worn by the women of Cuenca. She also raises chickens and pigs, both for her own household needs and to sell when her neighbors in the community ask for them, or when an economic emergency arises. \r\n\r\nShe has worked with the foundation for the past three years, and she tells us that the loans she has obtained have allowed her to carry out her work and to educate her children. With the loan provided to her by the Espoir Foundation, she will buy fabric to make bolsicones, blouses, skirts and pants for her regular customers. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to expand her business and eventually to build her own house.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":421782,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing fabric to make skirts, blouses, pants and traditional garments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-11-09T19:30:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ligia Cumanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":289.7,"local_amount":289.7,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":289.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789441},{"amount":76.98,"local_amount":76.98,"processed_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:25Z","rounded_local_amount":76.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679902},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:29:11Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679903},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:29Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074462},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:44Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074463},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910458},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:32Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910459},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:22Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946068},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":91.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:42Z","rounded_local_amount":91.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946069},{"amount":91.63,"local_amount":91.63,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:07Z","rounded_local_amount":91.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674470}],"funded_date":"2009-11-10T06:09:46Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":154617,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gladys sells garri (food item made from cassava) and firewood at retail prices to her customers.

She has been managing it for 18 years.  When she was young she studied the program, and it has been her source of income.  She has eight grown children, and she is 63.  It has been a joy to be able to support her children.  Because she is a widow, it was hard to get ahead.  She started with her own money, and she sold cosmetics traveling in the market.  Due to the crisis in country, unemployment, and low earnings she has not had the usual amount of customers.  This worries her because she has to pay her water, light, telephone, and loan monthly.  Her hope is that in this month of December when the young people always change their look she will be able to get more customers.  She hopes to be able to do a lot of straightening, tints, curling, and other things.  That is why she will buy tints, creams, nail polish, and materials to work on the feet and hands.

He is a local crop farmer growing rice, vegetables, and some fruit on his own farmland. He was married and has three children who live together in the family home.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions. Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A. is a 53-year-old villager, who supports his family by means of cattle breeding.

For this reason, Chynybek\u2019s family decided to engage in cattle breeding. \r\n<br>As Chynybek was born into a farmer\u2019s family and had wide experience in animal breeding, his start in this activity was successful. He used his initial capital of only 2,000 KGS to buy cattle and managed to increase the number. Also, Chynybek began to cultivate barley and perennial herbs, which serve as concentration of forage for his cattle. With the revenues from his business, Chynybek gave a good education to his children which allowed them to successfully manage their lives. \r\n<br>Now Chynybek plans to use this loan of 25,000 KGS to buy one heifer.

The advantage is that her farm land is irrigated through canals throughout the year, which reduces the risk of crop failure. Sonia continues in this activity, but knows that the major difficulty is to remain financially stable during the 6 months before harvesting. Consequently, she has chosen to invest in her pharmacy run by one of her relatives in Lima.

Latofatkhon is 42 years old. She and her husband have raised five children. For five years, Latofatkhon has been working in the largest local market of the city. She is selling rice of different sorts. Her market is situated in the central local market where there are always a lot of people. The business is very stable and generates the main income for the family since her husband, because of a difficult situation, had to leave for Russia to earn money. Latofatkhon has been working with IMON for a year, and had proved herself as an accurate client. Today she requests 3800 Somoni. The loan will be spent for purchasing rice to sell. Latofatkhon thanks all for support and promises to pay the loan on time.    \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

which is located in a rural area called Cruz del Camino in the community of Del Valle, 45 minutes from Cuenca. The climate is mild and the fields are good for raising crops. They raise corn, beans, potatoes and vegetable, not in large quantities because the residents go into the city to work, but enough to supply the area and for their own consumption. They also raise animals such as cows, sheep, chickens, geese, guinea pigs and others.\nGloria was born in 1966. Today she is 43 years old, divorced and has 3 children, 17, 15, and 4 years old. The two oldest work but they completed their schooling. Gloria does not really know how long she has been divorced because 15 years ago her husband went to another country and she never heard from him again and he forgot about his family. When she went to get a copy of her children\u00b4s birth certificates she found out that she was separated but never knew why. At that time she had only her two children. After about 10 years, she heard from the father of her children and he began to help them financially after the childen demanded it.\nShe lives in her own house and her two older children help her financially; one works in construction and the other works as a domestic employee in Cuenca.\nGloria\u00b4s business is animals; she goes to the livestock fairs which are held in different towns in Azuay province, such as in Paute, Gir\u00f3n, Azogues and other places. She does this from Wednesday to Sunday. Other days she takes care of her 87-year-old mother who is ill. She also takes care of her animals and her fields. She raises animals such as guinea pigs and chickens, and on Sundays she takes the livestock that she still has left over after the fairs to the open market where small animals are sold. She also sells from her home, on request.\nThe loan she is requesting will be used to buy more animals and feed for the animals. She currently has 100 free-range chickens (chickens fed organically) and 60 chickens raised on feed. She is very grateful to the Fundaci\u00f3n Espior because they help her business. Her goal is to be able to buy a car so that her son can help her with the business and not have to pay for transportation.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":360123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy livestock and feed for livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-08-03T18:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gloria Maxima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":715,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":89.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":89.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":89.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":89.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":89.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":89.38},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":89.38},{"due_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":89.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90.89,"local_amount":89.64,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:23:14Z","rounded_local_amount":90.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599394},{"amount":272.68,"local_amount":268.92,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:47:21Z","rounded_local_amount":272.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035104},{"amount":181.79,"local_amount":179.28,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:32:47Z","rounded_local_amount":181.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947358},{"amount":89.05,"local_amount":87.82,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:29:54Z","rounded_local_amount":89.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789194},{"amount":90.59,"local_amount":89.34,"processed_date":"2009-11-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:25Z","rounded_local_amount":90.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789195}],"funded_date":"2009-08-03T22:57:15Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T12:30:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Molly Puglisi","image":null}},{"id":129891,"name":"Bety","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\n Bety is a member of the Muungano borrower group in Ilala,iringa.she is 32 years old woman,she is married and a mother of 4 children.Her children are aged 18,13,8 and 5 years.\n\nBety started her own business selling clothes 10 years go,she works 12 hours a day and earn monthly profit approximately 300,000 Tanzania shillings.\n\nThis is Bety first loan from BRAC_Tanzania,she requested the amount of 300,000 Tsh in order to buy more clothes like vitenge,kanga(fabric).\n\nWith the profit she gains from the use of this loan Bety hopes to save more money and expand her business.

Islomiddin is a lively entrepreneur with a small business selling clothes and shoes for teenagers. He is an experienced entrepreneur having been self-employed for the past twelve years.\r\n\r\nBusiness has been good for Islomiddin. There is always demand for clothing and as the economy has improved in Tajikistan, so more people have been able to afford new clothing.\r\n\r\nIslomiddin is married and has three children. He is doing all his best to provide his children with the best future.\r\n\r\nIslomiddin has requested a loan of 2,500 USD to increase his available working capital. Eventually, he hopes to have his own small store. This loan will help him purchase new inventory and enable him to continue to invest in his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family especially in meeting their basic needs, saving for future use, making loan repayments, children\u2019s education expenses, and possible business expansion.\r\n\r\n About PMPC:\r\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":664624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Additional capital for her existing sari-sari store business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tangub-Silanga, Tangub City, Misamis Occidental, ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":126,"posted_date":"2010-12-14T15:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188738820},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:59:18Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191476962},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:56:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195902772},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:59:27Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201344325},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:42:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206212248},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-24T07:58:03Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211287500},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-19T08:02:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216567506},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T08:15:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221737251},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:11:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227107536},{"amount":57.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:02:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2512.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232868888}],"funded_date":"2010-12-25T03:15:59Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T10:02:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":261850,"name":"Ambrose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ambrose is a thirty-year-old man, married to a teacher, with one child, living in a rented house in Fort Portal, Uganda with a family dream of educating his child and setting up a business.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: Pig Fattening, Videoke and selling frozen foods. Her husband Rex, who is 50 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living. They have seven children who are between 15 and 28 years old. Genara joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Genara has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 30,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 4th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use as funds for her business operations so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Genara is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Ulugbek is 33 years old, and married with three children. He is the sole breadwinner for his family and his only income comes from the cultivation and sale of livestock at the local market. Every year, Ulugbek buys young heifers from farms in adjacent villages. He raises them with the help of his wife and children and then sells the adult cows and bulls to local butchers. Now Ulugbek is thinking about expanding his business, since the income from his present herd isn't enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase additional young cattle. To do this, he needs to invest in a loan of 4000 TJS for his business. In order to receive this amount, Ulugbek has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner organization, IMON International.  \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She has already received and successfully repaid three loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to increase the store inventory.  In the future, Radha plans to capitalize more.  She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  For more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner page and keep an eye out for new loans and borrower

He lives in the village of Koshelovo and owns a store called \"ABC\" located near the main road. \r\nSome time ago,Yaroslav's wife bought a house and restructured in for a business. Abut one year ago, Yaroslav opened his shop. Despite having a fledgling business, he has already achieved a great reputation among the townspeople and boasts regular customers. \r\nYaroslav needs a loan of 15,000 grivnas in order to stock up on goods before the holidays. In advance of Christmas and New Year's Eve, Ukrainians begin to spend lavishly on grocieries, therefore Yaroslav wants to be ready to meet increased demand for sweets, meat products, etc. \r\nYaroslav is full of ideas on how to expand his business. Because his store is spacious and has a separate entrance, he could rent out part of his building or, possibly, open something himself when his business allows it. One idea consists of opening a veterinary clinic, whose services would be in great demand since animal breeding is a common way to make a living for many people in that part of the country.

She has been a member of Life in Africa since 2006, and she is very active in the center. She is a supportive and responsible person who is also good at planning activities. Over time, she has developed the skill to face challenges and overcome them.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBefore Harriet joined Life in Africa, life was not easy in terms of general welfare. In her efforts to sustain herself, she searched for work. The work she discovered was with the stone quarry, where she did the stone digging and cracking. She was paid for the work she did. After some time of working at the stone quarry and witnessing others' success, Harriet got the idea to start her own stone quarry business. The stone-selling business is doing very well because of the massive developments of construction taking place.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe stone quarry business involves digging stones, cracking them into the desired sizes depending on the client's order, and delivering the cracked stones to the customers. Currently, Harriet has been producing two deliveries of stones supplied, getting a monthly profit of 90,000 Uganda shillings (UGX). (1USD = 1,722 UGX). She has been making two deliveries only due to limited capital. In order to be able to expand her business, she decided to ask for the loan. She expects to get an 45,000 UGX per delivery of stones made on a monthly basis.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTo be able to succeed in this business, Harriet is planning to employ people to do the work as it is

One of her children lives at home.  For more than 35 years she has ran a bakery, which is more than enough time to gain necessary experience for this job.  She and her husband get up at 2:00 am to knead 12 kilos of flour.  While the oven is being heated by firewood, she separates the dough into pieces, then bakes the loaves of bread.  Because of the high price of flour, her business has not been very profitable lately.  She wants to buy a kneading machine so she can make more bread.  When making bread by hand, she uses more flour, which weighs more, but the customers do not pay more.  With a kneading machine she can make more bread with the same amount of flour.  She can also make cakes and other baked items on the weekends.  During the first few days in November her sales triple due to a holiday where she makes and sells a typical sweet bread called \u201chuahuas.\u201d  This is her 3rd loan with MFP and  Luzmila has always been on time with her payments\u2014she has never procrastinated on making a payment.  The money will be used for a kneading machine that she really needs.  She will buy a used one since she can not afford a new one.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva

With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, thus uplifting her family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 7th loan, Lyna is borrowing PHP 18,000 which she intends to use to expand her fish and dried fish businesses so that she can continue to save for the future education of her children.\r\n\r\nLyna is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":563339,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish

She is married and has one child, aged 6.  In 2003, she established her grocery store business.  Working 7 days a week and 7 hours a day, she supports her family.  She has already received and successfully repaid three loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent to increase the store inventory.  In the future, Nitu plans to send her children to a good school.  She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery store, called a pasal, is an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.  For more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner page and keep an eye out for new loans and borrower updates.

Dancalan, Ilog, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating two business ventures: general store and buying & selling charcoal businesses.  Her husband Danilo, who is 32 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are between 2 to 11 years old. \r\n\r\nAmelita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Amelita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, with which she intends to buy stock for the general store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Amelita S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after Tajikistan\u2019s independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

They live in large traditional extended families with their children, husbands, parents-in-law, sisters-in-law, etc. They have an average age of 34 and at least 5 children.  They grow mainly rice, and they grown peanuts as a secondary business.  \r\n\r\nConcerned about making their farms profitable, the group members decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program five years ago.  After having correctly repaid the first four loans, they are now on their fifth farm loan.  \r\n\r\nThe current loan will be used to buy a sufficient quantity of seeds for planting rice and peanuts; some minor supplies and equipment; and fertilizers and such, for farming.  Supplies are gotten at the marketplaces of Fonfona, M\u2019pessoba, and Zansoni.  Following the off-season, the crops are stored for a certain time, so that they gain in value.  Then the crops are sold retail and wholesale in cash transactions at the M\u2019pessoba market and at surrounding markets.  Their customers come generally from large cities.  \r\n\r\nAfter selling their produce, the group members each intend to realize a profit of 80,000 francs CFA that will be used to repay the loan and to cover common family expenses.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":330629,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy fertilizers, seeds, and minor supplies and equipment ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nany","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia Bakary ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"S\u00e9tou Bourama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia Yafon ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baoumou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kadia Bourama ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"S\u00e9tou Harouna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia Mamori  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1525,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:08Z","rounded_local_amount":706153.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152143}],"funded_date":"2009-07-11T19:53:48Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":117637,"name":"Tamtaneh Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Here are Amed K., Bakarr K. and Mabinty Koroma of the Tamtaneh group.

Her son is married and her 17-year old daughter administers the business, a local store and small clothing shop. It took Idalia a lot of work to set up the store, using her savings from her work. She works as a cashier to maintain her business when sales are low. \r\n\r\nBy the grace of God she has been able to invest in many products her customers need. She offers store credit, but only to select customers because many people don't pay and she has to approve who she gives credit to. With this loan she wants to buy staple grains, canned milk, cleaning products, and various clothing for women and children, as well as cosmetics to attract new customers and to offer a variety of products to shoppers. \r\n\r\nShe has achieved all this with the support of the institution, AFODENIC. Thanks to this financing and her work, Idalia has been able to advance her business and her family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":450473,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of rice, beans, sugar, oil, canned milk, cleaning products, and clothing for women and children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2009-12-17T18:40:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Idalia Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T07:52:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123841507},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T07:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128874430},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-04-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:29:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136604309},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T08:30:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144639773},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:00:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151821556},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:02:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159561563},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:17:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1039.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166770498},{"amount":250,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:50Z","rounded_local_amount":5198.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172204392}],"funded_date":"2009-12-20T21:46:06Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T07:45:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vivian Lu","image":225936}},{"id":167074,"name":"Kofi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kofi (which means \"Friday born\") is 56 years old, married and the father of six children.

One of her dreams is to see her children become professionals and to buy herself a little car so that she can transport her groceries from the market to her store.\r\n\r\nShe is very grateful to Emprender and Kiva for the trust placed in her by granting the loan.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":487146,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy groceries.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"Santa Cruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-17.8 -63.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":110,"posted_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sonia\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":45.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":47.04},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":48.12},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":51.26},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":52.9},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":54.77},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":56.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":58.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.04},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.12},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.26},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.9},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.77},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.36},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":36.25,"local_amount":36.25,"processed_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:46:14Z","rounded_local_amount":36.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128936185},{"amount":45.16,"local_amount":45.16,"processed_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":45.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136663729},{"amount":47.04,"local_amount":47.04,"processed_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:52Z","rounded_local_amount":47.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144696535},{"amount":48.12,"local_amount":48.12,"processed_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:39:03Z","rounded_local_amount":48.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151879586},{"amount":49.99,"local_amount":49.99,"processed_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:51:32Z","rounded_local_amount":49.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159619660},{"amount":51.26,"local_amount":51.26,"processed_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:03:20Z","rounded_local_amount":51.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166834123},{"amount":52.9,"local_amount":52.9,"processed_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172100696},{"amount":54.77,"local_amount":54.77,"processed_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:38:45Z","rounded_local_amount":54.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177393534},{"amount":56.36,"local_amount":56.36,"processed_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:48:31Z","rounded_local_amount":56.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182531976},{"amount":58.15,"local_amount":58.15,"processed_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:55:53Z","rounded_local_amount":58.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188668592}],"funded_date":"2010-03-14T05:03:34Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:55:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":179740,"name":"Charlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Charlita T. is from the village of  Kadingilan, Bukidnon.
