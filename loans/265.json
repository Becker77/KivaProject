She lives in Nitop in Bamenda, Northwest Cameroon. Being a widow, she must fend for herself and her children, in this case through her firewood business. Additionally, Bih has encountered problems such as illness within the family and problems faced by her son in the Southwest region, costing Bih much money to remedy the situation. Notwithstanding that, Bih H. is quite ready to fight through life to the last moment with every morsel of her strength. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is why she became a GHAPE beneficiary in 2008. She prefers to work with GHAPE because their loan conditions work well for her. This is Bih\u2019s second loan from GHAPE. She plans to buy firewood, then transport and split it. Firewood is always needed in her community, so her business is sure to be successful. With the profits from this loan, she plans to pay for her children's school fees and other educational needs and pay off medical bills. She hopes this loan will improve her and her family's standard of living. \r\n<p>\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business and financial management, basic health maintenance, life skills and family values. Clients are also required to deposit a small amount of money into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community among its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":382466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

Lucena has successfully repaid a previous loan of 20000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Lucena is requesting a new loan of 20000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the ninth loan taken out by Lucena from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She is 57 years old. Felisa is married and has 3 adult children. To make a living, Felisa owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling charcoal in the local community. Felisa has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Felisa joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Felisa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Felisa is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Felisa from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Paralelo a esta actividad, ella realiza jornadas de trabajo, en cultivos de sus vecinos; quienes le pagan un dinero extra por su trabajo. Ahora est\u00e1 planeando sembrar en mayores cantidades, pues requiere de mayor capital. Ella pertenece al banco comunal \u201cflor de almendra\u201d, y este es el primer cr\u00e9dito que tiene con MFP, donde est\u00e1 segura podr\u00e1 alcanzar sus objetivos. Manuela, est\u00e1 pensando utilizar el cr\u00e9dito en arreglar el auto que tiene, para incursionar en el trasporte p\u00fablico cubriendo las rutas Kivinaki-Cerro Picaflor. \n\n","en":"Manuela, age 43, is a valiant single mother who cares for her four children with much love and affection.  She lives in her own home in the native community of Kivinaki in the central Peruvian jungle.  The serious demeanor of this hardworking woman indicates the constant struggle she faces to move her children forward.  For the past ten years, Manuela has been caring for her coffee and orange crops each day beginning in the early morning hours.  These crops have resulted in good earnings as a result of her negotiations with the intermediaries who visit her three hectares of land during the harvest season.  In addition to her own farm, Manuela works as a laborer in cultivating the crops of her neighbors who pay her extra money for her work.  Now she plans to grow her crops in greater quantities, but she needs more capital.\r\n<p>\r\nManuela is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cFlor de Almendra\u201d (Almond Blossom).  This is her first loan with MFP.  She is confident that her group can accomplish its objectives.  Manuela will use her loan to repair her automobile since she plans to enter the public transportation sector by offering services along the routes betweeen Kivinaki and Cerro Picaflor.

D. lives in Abdurahmon Jomi. He is 27 years old, is married and does not have children.  Zarobuddin has a high school education and sells food.  He has a small store where he sells his products.  He brings products from Dushanbe.  Zarobuddin has been in this business for 3 years and would like to increase his inventory.  He needs a loan to do that and this is why he has turned to us.  Zarobuddin will pay back the loan over a 12 month period.  <p>\r\n\r\nBy getting new products, the client will not only increase his own income, but will also provide local residents with food products.

Yamileth's dream is to triumph in the food service industry, now that there are many restaurants in competition with her.  She wants to improve both her food service and attention for her customers because they provide the income for her business.  \r\n<p>\r\nHer profits come from selling food and renting rooms to students.  She has owned her business for 26 years.  She began   working on her own, renting rooms in her home to the students.  When the students requested that she also prepare their meals, she started a formal business.  This endeavor has turned out to be one of her most enjoyable experiences.\r\n<p>\r\nShe will use the money from the loan to buy products that she uses to prepare meals.

Yolanda C., 30 years of age, is the wife of Rolando C., an electrician. Her husband is the one who assembles the video game machines and videoke (amateur singing to a recorded music video background) machines and sells them to their customers.\r\n\r\nYolanda and Rolando are now living happily in Barangay III, Tangub City and are blessed with three children all of whom are now of school age.\r\n\r\nThe couple has run this video game and videoke machine-assembly business for already ten years. From the average of two units being assembled and sold, they are earning an average net income of P6,000 a month. With eight units of videoke machine and several video game machines operating in the city, they are also receiving an average share from all these units of not less than P5,000 every 15th and 30th day of the month.\r\n\r\nJust this year, Yolanda joined Paglaum MPC because she is interested in our programs and services. With a good character and with capacity, she was given the privilege of obtaining a loan of P50,000 with the purpose of purchasing additional parts and accessories to assemble new video game units and to recondition all other old units for sale.\r\n\r\nThe future profits from this loan will be used to save for their children\u2019s future and for their daily needs. The couple plans to expand their business to other cities and nearby municipalities.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":431943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Games","sector":"Entertainment","themes":null,"use":"To

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She lives in her own house, together with her husband Marcos, 36, and their only daugther Yelisa, 13. They are the reason for her hard work. With a great deal of effort Carmen has worked the fields and made them fertile. She sows potatoes and peas and she sells the harvest on a wholesale basis in the city of Tarma. The income from the sales has granted them the necessary finances to support the family which is why she puts all she's got into  her business. She has been harvesting for 4 years and she very much enjoys the work. The hardest part is distributing the product to the markets. The sacks are very heavy and make her very tired. In the future she would like to improve production to see better revenues. This is the eighth loan cycle with MFP (Kiva Field Partner). She has always been on time in the past and she is committed to being on time again. In her community group she is a very involved member, always on top of the group's business dealings.

He is married and has two children.\r\n\r\nSantos learned to farm when he was 10 years old.  It was his dad who taught him because they didn't have a regular job and he has several siblings.  In farming, they found a way of making a living and a way of life.  Santos currently sows corn with a gravity irrigation system as it is the dry season (a system through which water for irrigating the crops doesn't need any mechanisms, just gravity.  A slope is found for the water to run down and find its level, watering all the crops). However, when it rains, Santos says that they lose crops through flooding as the water is not very deep.\r\n\r\nSantos walks for fifteen minutes from his house to the main road where he boards a bus which takes thirty minutes to get to the city where he buys his farming supplies.\r\n\r\nSantos is requesting a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Campo so that he can buy 12 sacks of fertilizer, 80 pounds of corn seed, and other supplies that he needs to sow 14,000 square meters of corn which he waters with a gravity irrigation system and sells on the cob.\r\n\r\nBy purchasing his supplies all in one go, Santos obtains lower prices and avoids having to travel to buy in small amounts.  In addition, he will be certain that he can give his crops the care they need, when they need it.  This will allow his production to increase and also his income.\r\n\r\nSantos will work hard to build a house from brick as he currently lives in a house made from adobe which doesn't have internal room divisions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":914698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy 12 sacks of fertilizer, 80 pounds of corn seed and other supplies he needs to sow 14,000 square meters of corn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Usulut\u00e1n","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Santos Cesar","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1000,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283491896}],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T20:28:45Z","paid_date":"2012-06-16T08:21:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":360686,"name":"Srauy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Srauy (in the photo) and her husband, Po are farmers.

name is Catarina C., and I am a 39-year-old native of Salamanga, Matutuine district, Maputo province. I am a married mother of 4 children, and I attended school up until the 6th grade. I could not continue my studies due to the 16-year civil war that severely affected the Matutuine district. During the civil war my parents took refuge in neighboring South Africa. For two years I worked as a cabinet-maker in a carpenter\u2019s shop and after that I worked as a housemaid for two residences. In 1989 I married a young Mozambique man who at the time also worked in South Africa. With the end of the civil war in 1992 my husband and I decided to return to Mozambique. In 1994, after settling the family in the city of Maputo, I dedicated myself to the sale of diverse products from my residence. My family found it difficult adapting to urban life and in 1995 we decided to move back to my native home of Salamanga, Matutuine district. That same year I began to work on a project of reintegration for those returning from neighboring countries; I worked as a sewing instructor. At project\u2019s end in 1996 I returned to the sale of everyday goods at the local market. In 1998 I rented a small commercial establishment belonging to my brother, and to this day I continue to work there. At this time my husband and I and 4 other employees depend on this business. With the loan I intend to acquire a vehicle to transport diverse cargo to my commercial establishment. This would facilitate our contribution to the increased rent and to the availability of diverse products at accessible prices to more than 100 families residing in the town of Salamanga. <p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Marco Alves, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>Catarina C. de 39 anos de idade, Natural de Salamanga, distrito de Matutu\u00edne Prov\u00edncia de Maputo, Casada Maritalmente, M\u00e3e de 4 filhos, tendo sido escolarizada at\u00e9 6\u00aa classe, N\u00e3o conseguiu continuar mais com os estudos devido a  guerra  civil dos 16 que afectou severamente o distrito de Matutu\u00edne.\r\n\r\nDurante a guerra os pais refugiaram-se na vizinha \u00c1frica do Sul em  1985, Por l\u00e1 come\u00e7ou a trabalhar numa Carpintaria com a Fun\u00e7\u00e3o de marceneira,  por um per\u00edodo de Dois Anos e mais tarde veio a trabalhar como empregada Domestica em duas residenciais.  \r\n\r\nEm 1989 Casou-se Maritalmente na Africa do sul com um jovem mo\u00e7ambicano, que na altura se encontrava a trabalhar naquele pais vizinho. \r\n\r\nCom o fim da Guerra em 1992 decidem com o marido voltar a Mo\u00e7ambique em 1994,  Tendo  fixado a fam\u00edlia na cidade do Maputo e l\u00e1 dedicava-se a venda de produtos diversos na sua resid\u00eancia, segundo ela, n\u00e3o foram felizes com a realidade urbana assim viram-se obrigados em 1995 a voltar para Salamanga no distrito de Matutu\u00edne, zona de origem. \r\n\r\nAinda no mesmo ano come\u00e7ou a trabalhar num projecto de reasentamento dos regressados dos pa\u00edses vizinhos como facilitadora dos cursos de corte e costura.

san is a charming 31 year old lady, has two children and is separated from her husband. She lives in the town of Ruai in the outskirts of Nairobi. By natural instinct Susan started braiding her sister\u2019s hair when they were growing up. As time went by she became an expert in plaiting and braiding hair. A close friend of hers who was operating a salon suggested she learn how to apply chemical to clients\u2019 hair and also how to style hair. Her friend taught her the skills free of charge over a period of two years. Susan saved Ksh 5,000 (USD 76) while she was a member of a merry-go-round group in her village. From this money, she rented a stall for Ksh 2,000 (USD 30) in the year 2005. With the balance she bought a mirror for the stall and then started plaiting clients\u2019 hair since she did not have enough money to purchase salon equipment. Her friend Catherine Wambura then gave her a blow-dryer free of charge in order to support herself. Clients flocked her stall and by the end of the year 2005, from her small savings and proceedings from her business, Susan managed to buy a dryer. Today her salon is one of the most frequently visited salons in Ruai. Due to the growing number of customers and the desire to give them first class service, Susan is requesting for a loan of USD 475 in kind, which will enable her to purchase a blow-dryer, hair dryer, steamer, and various chemicals. This will greatly help to support her business since she could not steam clients\u2019 hair before due to lack of a steaming machine. This equipment will greatly boost her business. She intends to pay her loan within a period of 8-12 months."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":41066,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase  a blow drier, Hair drier, Steamer ane Hair relaxing chemicals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Ruai, Nairobi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":36,"posted_date":"2007-06-08T04:13:59Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-06-22T10:17:32Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":475,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2007-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2007-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2007-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2007-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2007-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2008-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2008-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":59.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2007-08-10T09:17:08Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-10T10:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41038},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2007-09-10T09:17:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-10T10:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52814},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T09:17:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-10T10:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65539},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2007-11-10T10:18:31Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-10T10:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":79402},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2007-12-10T10:19:53Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-10T10:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":94671},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2008-01-10T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-10T10:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":113187},{"amount":60,"local_amount":60,"processed_date":"2008-02-10T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-10T10:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":60,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":132590},{"amount":55,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2008-03-10T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-10T10:29:15Z","rounded_local_amount":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":154527}],"funded_date":"2007-06-08T10:17:32Z","paid_date":"2008-03-10T10:04:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":5,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":15633,"name":"Liana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Liana is a widow with a grown son named Arthur.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions.

Some raise cuy (guinea pigs) and will use the loan for food and medicines for their animals.\n\nAll of the members appreciate and thank you for the loan and promise to pay the monthly payments on time.\n\n(EDY MARLENY is not pictured in the photo)"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4725,"image":{"id":423209,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":1281,"youtubeId":"fPi6ZMrPhXM","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur EDY MARLENY from  Peru","thumbnailImageId":423209},"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Breadmaking supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Oropesa - Quispicanchi - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-11-16T18:30:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4725,"lender_count":152,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edy Marleny","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Tania Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alicia Fortunata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose Braulio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Segura Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Medi Flavia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicitas\n","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carlota Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanez","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vda De Astete Guillermina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Mercerdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":13800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":4725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2080.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":2163.73},{"due_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2250.28},{"due_date":"2010-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":2340.3},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2433.92},{"due_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2531.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":712.35},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":740.84},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":770.47},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":801.3},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833.36},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":866.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":712.43,"local_amount":2080.74,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:36:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2083.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103750224},{"amount":740.95,"local_amount":2164.05,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T12:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2167.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110637652},{"amount":770.58,"local_amount":2250.58,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":2253.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118034149},{"amount":801.39,"local_amount":2340.56,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:05:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2344.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123872246},{"amount":833.44,"local_amount":2434.16,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:19:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2437.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128905513},{"amount":866.21,"local_amount":2529.91,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2533.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136633168}],"funded_date":"2009-11-18T16:31:20Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T09:48:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Liz Nagle","image":784126}},{"id":155108,"name":"Nary's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Nary H. is a group leader of four members who all live in the Kshach village in Kandal province.

She has a perfect repayment record on past loans, and her story is typical of other Dominican and Haitian borrowers at Esperanza International.\r\n\r\nSory lives with her husband and four children in El Seybo, a small rural town in the heart of the agricultural east of the Dominican Republic. Life in rural areas of the Dominican Republic can be tough, with no potable running water, frequent power outages (if one has power to begin with), and inadequate access to healthcare among other issues. Despite these difficulties, Sory has a successful small business selling clothing to people in her community. With this loan, she will buy underwear, women\u2019s pants, and bedsheets to sell at a small markup.\r\n\r\nThis is Sory\u2019s eighth loan with Esperanza International. In less than three years, she has been able to increase her loan size by nearly ten times, a true testament to her hard work. With continued profits, Sory hopes to keep the growth of her business going and finish the construction of her home in order to give her family a more comfortable place to live (a common construction technique in the Dominican Republic is to build in stages as one acquires the money to do so). In addition, her profits have given Sory confidence that her children will grow up with a good education and have the opportunity to pursue any profession they desire, a luxury Sory did not have while growing up.\r\n\r\nEsperanza International seeks to free children and their families through initiatives that generate income, education and health, and that restore self-worth and dignity to those who have lost hope.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

But given the cost of living, people prefer second-hand clothing, and so there is less work for him, and thus he earns less.  This situation obliges Ms. K. to commit more income to household expenses than her husband does.  An honest and energetic woman, she has several apprentices in her shop, which is called \u00abMain de Dieu\u00bb, or Hand of God.  She needs more machines to ensure that her apprentices are well-trained and to guarantee her shop\u2019s good reputation.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nTo do this, Ms. K. is requesting a loan of $950 as capital to buy five sewing machines and also work-related materials.

Rosa recounts that like all the community, she suffered as a child as well as in part of her adolescence, because her parents had few economic resources. In 1982 her family was severely affected by the armed conflict, and one of the hardest moments was the loss of her husband as of twelve years ago. Because of this, she was extremely upset and the difficult situation meant she was solely responsible for providing an income to maintain her family.  It was this situation that obliged her to fight for her children. <\/p> \r\n<p>Now, she is a traditional artisan, and one of her dreams is to achieve economic stability: for this reason she wants to continue fighting to have the opportunity to deliver her products directly to a market, whether it be in Guatemala or even better overseas.  She understands that currently the Guatemalan market and that of her own home town has some disadvantages: there is too much competition and this means that the products she makes have to be delivered at a lower price than she considers ideal. Thanks to Friendship Bridge, she has seized the opportunity to participate in the second cycle with the Women\u2019s group EBEN-EZER, she feels a lot of gratitude towards this groups, because if it had not been for this organisation, she wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity and she considers them like part of her family who have offered her a lot of support.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Translated from the Spanish by Katy Long, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><\/p>\r\nEn el a\u00f1o 1965 un 14 de septiembre, Nace la se\u00f1ora Rosa Marina ,M. en el municipio de san Juan Comalapa del Departemanto de Chimaltenango do\u00f1a Rosa cuenta que ella pues como toda persona sufre de ni\u00f1a ya que sus padres son de escasos recursos econ\u00f3micos, cuenta que tanto en su ni\u00f1ez y parte de su juventud sufri\u00f3.

Iluminada has successfully repaid a previous loan of 25,000 PHP from ASKI. She is requesting a new loan of 30,000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies.

For the past 10 years Latifatou has lived in the Ayetawadja neighborhood of Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin. Latifatou is the mother of 3 school aged children and married to Soule Adelou, a businessman. Latifatou lives together with her husband and children. Together, the couple meet the needs of the family. Latifatou did not attended school. \r\n\r\nWhen she was about 8 years old, Latifatou started to sell fabrics by hawking in Dantokpa, the international market of Benin. With this business she earned income which she used to meet her various responsibilities. Latifatou buys her provisions in Lome, Togo, a country neighboring on Benin. Latifatou has already benefited from 3 loans made with ALIDe and these have been duly repaid. Latifatou has recently been experiencing difficulty in acquiring her provisions. For this reason Latifatou has requested this, her fourth loan, to satisfy her customers demands and increase the scope of her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by David Gibbons, Kiva

Her husband Noel, who is 52 years old, works as a carpenter to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are between 18 and 29 years old. Merlinda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Merlinda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 13,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 10th loan, she is borrowing PHP 16,000, which she intends to use to fund her business operations so that she can continue to save up for future house renovation. E. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Born in 1954 in Glidji, this good and honest woman got started in the commerce of staple goods a very long time ago.  It's a business she has perfectly mastered.  She basically go from market to market to buy grain (corn, beans, millet) that she stocks and resells to her numerous customers.  Given the responsibilities she is shouldering by herself, she can no longer satisfy the demands of her customers, and her revenues are tending to drop.  She's therefore requesting a loan to bolster her business and make it profitable. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

mostly in the summer because it is on the coast of Kyrgyzstan's beautiful lake, Issyk\u2013Kyl. Although there is unemployment, the citizens of Balykchy mostly sell fish and goods in the markets, and thus they live. \r\n\r\nHowever, some of them are really hardworking people. One of them is Shayinbubu S., who is a thirty-year-old young lady. She is married and has a son, age five. Her husband is a self-employed taxi driver. Both husband and son help Shayinbubu in her business. Together they sell clothes in the market. With the profit they have bought a car. They thank God that all their troubled days are in the past. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning, when it was really hard even to have bread daily, they did not crack. Instead they were determined to find a way out of that situation. About five years ago, for 5,000 KGS ($115), Shayinbubu bought a sewing machine, and little by little she started her business. She was sewing national items and selling them until they got a loan from Mol Bulak Finance. Now she has shifted from making national items to trading clothes. Now she sells women's and men's pants, and she sells apples in the summer. She is planning to buy a big new house and provide education for her son as well. Her monthly profit is about 11,000 KGS ($250). She wants a loan to buy a spring assortment of clothes for both females and males, and to sell the clothes in remote districts on weekends.\r\n\r\nAyzat S. is a twenty-nine-year-old married woman who has two children. Her husband works as the driver of a lorry. His salary is 4,000 KGS ($89). Her elder son is nine and goes to school. Her daughter is five and she attends kindergarten.  Ayzat works at the post office and earns 2,500 KGS ($55). They are planning to buy furniture and educate their children. With the loan they are requesting, they want to buy curtains for their house.\r\n\r\nRakyia B. is a married woman. She is thirty-nine years old and they have four children; two daughters and two sons. The older son attends school, as do their two daughters, but the youngest child is at home. The older daughter helped her mother distribute goods which were bought with saved money (5,000 KGS ($112), and later on the business was expanded and increased among the companies. Her elder daughter graduated from a specialized school. They want a loan to buy a foal and to re-do their house. In the future they are planning to buy a house, a car and give education to their children.\r\n\r\nMednina S. is a young lady who is twenty-four years old and has two children. She is married, and her husband works at a construction company. A year ago, when she started her business with 2,000 KGS ($45), she and her sister were selling half-built houses. Now her revenue is about 4,000 KGS ($90). She wants to buy her own house because she lives with her relatives now. She wants a loan to invest, and with the profits she wants to make her dream come true.\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

They have a beautiful cozy home located in the main square of town.\r\n<p>\r\nRita claims that she can sell anything that touches her hands.  She is an excellent merchant who attends to her customers with kindness.  For 17 years, she has managed her grocery business from a space in her house where she also offers juices and fruit extracts.  Rita begins her work at 4am and continues until 11pm so that her store is always stocked with baked goods.  Every Thursday, she travels to the city where she buys vegetables at reduced prices.  A few days ago, she had an oven built so that she could produce delicious handmade breads to sell in her shop.  Meanwhile, her husband grows coffee, avocados, bananas, and corn to cover their living expenses and pay for their children\u2019s education.  Rita is also saving money because she is planning to rebuild her house out of solid materials.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP.  Rita feels that she can move forward with her objectives because she is willing to work with the other members of her Communal Bank, who invited her to become a member of the group.  With the money that was requested, she will purchase a refrigerator so that she can begin selling meat such as mutton, pork, and chicken, as well as ground condiments and popsicles.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":505609,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a refrigerator","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-16T18:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1061.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153894}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T19:53:48Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":188595,"name":"Mar\u00eda Rina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" La se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Rina C. se desempe\u00f1a como maestra de primaria y trabaja en la escuela Marcos Dessys  en la Ciudad de Chinandega, es casada y tiene 1 hijos uno menor de edad habita en el Reparto Libertad.\n\nLa se\u00f1ora Mar\u00eda Rina solicit\u00f3 el cr\u00e9dito para gastos personales servicios b\u00e1sicos y para ayudarle a sus padres con medicinas ya que el pap\u00e1 se encuentra enfermo y pagar deudas.\n","en":"Mar\u00eda Rina C. is a primary school teacher at Marcos Dessys school in Chinandega.

V. is 34 and married with six children.  She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Palepa has many years of experience in this business.  Palepa needs a loan of WST 1000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Palepa joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Palepa's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\n\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Madaminjon is a very courageous man who can manage tough jobs like raising cattle and agriculture. He is the father of two children and has the responsibility of supporting his family and providing them with everything that they need. In spite of his difficult economic situation, after much time Madaminjon was able to get ahead through his business of purchasing cattle and breeding them on his property. His greatest goal is to improve his economic situation and provide a better way of life for his family.  For this reason, Madaminjon came to IMON International for loans to purchase animals for his breeding business. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. The SEM Fund works to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":24387,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

From childhood on he has been a farmer and since he got married he inherited the fields that were rightfully his.\r\n\r\nHe works uninterruptedly farming potatoes and corn.  His wife has always been his main helper as have been his children since this activity requires much effort and he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it all by himself.\r\n\r\nHe states that he likes working in the fields because it\u2019s tranquil but he knows that all the effort he puts into his work will yield good rewards. Therefore, he will continue working in this activity aiming to improve production.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP.  He is happy to know that he can count on financial support.  He is also pleased to be part of a communal bank because all the members are people known to him and they are responsible and mutually supportive.  \r\n\r\nHe is grateful to all those who will fund the loan he is requesting that will be so useful for his continued progress.\r\n\r\nHe will use the requested funds to buy manure and seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":605710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy manure and seed.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Feliciano ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1049.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327003}],"funded_date":"2010-10-05T02:04:16Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}}]}
