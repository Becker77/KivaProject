She opens the establishment at 7 in the morning and closes at 6 in the evening.  She needs to increase income and sales.  She sells a suit for 2000 meticais, pants for 500, and skirts for 400, 500, or 600 meticais.

Remedios owns & operates a business producing and selling food. Her main income comes from selling cooked food for daily meals.

Remedios has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Remedios is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Remedios from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated as a cash reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

He is a welder and his wife is a petty trader dealing in assorted soft drinks. Joseph left school in form 4 as a dropout.  He has been a welder for the last ten years.  He worked for a boss who trained him in welding for eight years. Two years ago, Joseph decided to establish his own metal workshop.\r\n\r\nHe said that the demand for metal doors and windows has increased over the years because of the upsurge of armed robberies.  He is not able to meet all the orders placed by customers because he is limited by inadequate working capital and too little equipment.

She is 29 years old. Kimberly Ann is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Kimberly Ann makes and sells food. The main source of income for the business comes from peddling snacks and other delicacies in the local community. Kimberly Ann has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 1,500 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Kimberly Ann joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Kimberly Ann has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI, a Kiva partner. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. \r\n\r\nKimberly Ann is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to increase her working capital, thereby allowing her to cook more and sell more snack foods. This will be the second loan taken out by Kimberly Ann from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About HSPFI<\/b>\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

As rugs are a major part of Filipino housekeeping and cleaning, they are one of the most common products that you can buy, sometimes even from a peddler while you are riding in a speeding jeepney (a small bus) down the highway. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 3500 Phillipines pesos (PHP) in sales every week.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 36,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy more quantities of raw materials and supplies like fabric, thread, and other materials for her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nLeonora hopes to increase production and dreams to be able to give everyone in her family a good life through all of her hard work on her business.

Other members will use their shares of the loan to purchase tools that will help them to do better work in such activities as carpentry and bricklaying, or to improve the tools that they currently have, as is the case with the members who make a living in activities like public transport.

E. is from the village of Tabuan, Tukuran, Zamboanga Del Sur. She is 39 years old. Glorie is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Glorie operates a specialized retail store. The main source of income for the business comes from selling vegetables in the local community. Glorie has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 7,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Glorie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Glorie is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used as additional capital for vegetable vending. This will be the first loan taken out by Glorie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She is separated and the mother of 3 three children, who are 13, 10, and 4.  The oldest ones go to school.  She studied through 10th grade and later continued studying to be a teacher in the Instituto de Magist\u00e9rio Prim\u00e1rio in Matola.  She lives in her own home with her children and doesn't support anyone else besides them.  She never moved from the city where she lives.  After her separation, she continued living with her children, and she works as a teacher for the Ministry of Education.  She earns a salary of 7,600 meticais per month.  With the help of a subsidy that the father of her children sends her every month, she feeds her family and saves some in her bank account.  She has never had a loan with another bank.  She became familiar with Hluvuku through her colleagues, and this is her 3rd loan.  It is for 20,500 meticais and she will use it to buy construction materials (doors, windows, cement, etc.) to improve her home.  Her previous loans were also used for this purpose.  She hopes to request more loans in the future to be able to finish her home, to buy furniture, and to offer better living conditions to her children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

She is married and has 6 children. To make a living, Josie owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising livestock. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Josie has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 1,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nJosie joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josie is requesting a loan of 6000 PHP which will be used to purchase feed and baby livestock to raise & sell in future. This will be the first loan taken out by Josie from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children and save as a reserve for emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.  Based in Bohol, they have numerous branches throughout the Philippines.  In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring.  CEVI not only provides credit for its clients but additionally savings, insurance, and training which are provided through regular cluster group meetings.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This is how she learned how to make underwear and infant wear as well as men\u2019s clothing.

She sends important amounts to the cities because her daughter is a great support in this process which earns her a basic salary.\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo and she hopes to use a Kiva loan to buy assorted fabric, decorations and supplies to make panties, brassieres and party clothes for the approaching end of year festivities.

Abdulatif is in the livestock business. He breeds livestock, with which he provides sustenance for his humble home. Abdulatif is married and has 5 children. It is important to note that since he started his business, he has acquired an abundance of experience due to his great dedication and the knowledge he has acquired from breeding his animals. The reason that Abdulatif looks for support from IMON International is that he needs to purchase livestock so he may sell it and continue with his arduous work with cattle in this sector.     \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns her living by operating a bakery and a fishing business. Her husband Pedrito, who is 62 years old, works as a baker to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have 11 children who are between 18 and 39 years old. Quirina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Quirina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 29,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 16,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,500 to fund the operation of her bakery and fishing businesses so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs and family needs. Quirina is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Currently he has his own carpentry and mechanical workshop and it's going very well. He has a lot of order to fill and knows that he has to finish them all if he wants his business to keep growing.

He is 53 years old and lives with his mother who is 79 years old. \r\n\r\nElguja requested credit for the expansion of his rabbit-breeding farm. He has 85 rabbits. He sells them on the Kutaisi and Samtredia (nearby towns) open markets. Elguja also has 2 pigs and sells piglets in the local market. The total average monthly income of the family is 580 Laris, including the monthly pension of Elguja\u2019s mother. \r\n\r\nElguja requested credit to purchase materials for a rabbit hutch expansion, as the existing rabbit hutch is too small and doesn\u2019t allow him to keep more rabbits. Also, part of the requested funds will be used to purchase rabbit feed for the winter season. After the expansion of the rabbit hutch, Elguja will keep more rabbits and increase sales. He will get more income and will be able to improve the living conditions for himself and his old mother. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":870449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase materials for a rabbit hutch expansion and feed for the rabbits","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Partskhanakanebi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2011-09-16T02:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elguja","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65.66},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":71.18},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":74.54},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":76.13},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":78.71},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82.78},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84.2},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.57},{"due_date":"2012-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90.04},{"due_date":"2012-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":93.41},{"due_date":"2012-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96.27},{"due_date":"2012-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":99.51}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.04},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.49},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.58},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.2},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.74},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.62},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.73},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.28},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.38},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.04,"local_amount":65.66,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T09:22:55Z","rounded_local_amount":68.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238658748},{"amount":44.49,"local_amount":71.18,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:36:06Z","rounded_local_amount":73.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244612804},{"amount":46.58,"local_amount":74.54,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:43:31Z","rounded_local_amount":77.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250828052},{"amount":47.58,"local_amount":76.13,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:09:19Z","rounded_local_amount":79.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257238237},{"amount":49.2,"local_amount":78.71,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:21:36Z","rounded_local_amount":81.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263377664},{"amount":396.11,"local_amount":633.78,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:19:18Z","rounded_local_amount":658.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270091375}],"funded_date":"2011-09-24T00:51:03Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:19:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Victoria Lazarova","image":1669010}},{"id":339887,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virginia is 57 years old, married, and has three children.They live in the province of Isabela where her husband plants rice as the family's primary source of income. \r\n\r\nVirginia is hardworking woman who she raises piglets.

pertanian, khususnya tanaman sayur kacang panjang. Okayoni merasa sangat  senang dengan pekerjaan yang ditekuni ini, terlebih lagi setelah mendapat pinjaman periode pertama dari Dinari. Okayoni merasa hasil yang di perolehpun semakin meningkat. Hal ini tak terlepas dari hasil kerja keras dan bantuan modal yang di peroleh untuk penyediaan pupuk maupun obat-obatan yang di butuhkan oleh tanamannya.                                    nPada panen yang lalu Okayoni mendapatkan hasil yang cukup lumayan yaitu sebesar Rp 2.000.000.-  Hasil ini sudah merupakan keuntungan bersih setelah dipotong biaya bibit, pupuk, obat-obatan dan tenaga kerja. Namun  semua itu dikerjakan selama hampir 4 bulan dari pengolahan tanah sampai selesai panen. nBersama dengan I Ketut Sudi Utama, suaminya, Okayoni saat ini telah menanam kembali bibit baru untuk musim berikutnya dan sangat berharap masih mendapat pinjaman dari Dinari karena keuntungan yang didapat belum cukup untuk membiayai seluruh keperluan usahanya dan juga sebagian besarnya telah dipakai untuk memenuhi kebutuhan sehari-hari dan biaya pendidikan 3 orang anaknya. Apalagi saat ini biaya kebutuhan  semakin naik, termasuk juga didalamnya Pupuk dan Obat-obatan. Untuk menunjang usahanya, Okayoni bergabung dengan program Dinari yang jangka waktunya selama 6 bulan dan pengembalian pinjaman pada akhir periode. n","en":"Okayoni and her husband are long bean farmers.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in Isabela, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 8,000. Rosine is borrowing PHP 12,000 to buy more stock to sell. This will be her 20th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Rosine aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is convinced that the variety of products she offers increases her sales.  For this reason, she takes a lot of care not to repeat designs.  In addition, she makes good income from selling her own creations.  \"My husband helps me in making my tapestries and blankets\" Enma says \"while I knit with wooden needles\".  In this way, Enma is able to pay for her children's education.  She has been in this business for 20 years and she considers the most difficult part of her work to be transporting her handicrafts to her sales stall as she lives a very long way away.  However, she is comforted by the fact that she is putting together some money in order to be able to buy her own vehicle as she also receives a percentage of .400 to .500 Peruvian soles from charging people in her area for electricity.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Enma hopes to put together the money she needs to set up a store where she can sell her items more peacefully.  She belongs to the 'Mujeres al Futuro' community bank and this is her fourth loan from MFP.  She hopes to receive a small loan so that she can achieve her goals.

The flood-tide of any kind of business success, however, comes with an unwavering hard work ethic, enterprise, tenacity and a sense of determination.

Along the way, notwithstanding, he has had to grapple with the inevitable hurdles that come with running any kind of business. He was mostly hard pressed in consolidating his finances in his business's fledgling years. This, in a way, meant stagnation in his activity. He had less farm inputs like harvest baskets, hoes for weeding, etc. He was also hard pressed in purchasing better manure for his farms. In the face of all this, his philosophy was to remain upbeat and hope for the best.\r\n\r\nAmos says he set forth in his business with savings from his coffee sales enterprise. He plys his business in Kihihi, in the West of Uganda. He has not dispensed with the coffee sales business, however. Amos says, though, that he has much more leeway to make up. Where he has gotten so far is encouraging. He plans on buying more land to expand his tea farming business.\r\n\r\nMonthly this business's gross profits total up to Uganda shillings 250,000. Amos says he intends to utilize this Kiva Loan to purchase high grade manure for his

This is 39-year-old Hawa M. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with 3 children, between the ages of 2 and 14. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting 2 dependants because their parents had passed away due to HIV\/AIDS.<p>\r\nHawa has been running a kuku (chicken) business since 2007. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. Firstly, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing, they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.<p>\r\nShe works at the business 16+ hours a day, 7 days a week, with the help of her children when they are home from school. She is requesting a loan of $250 in order to build a chicken coop so she has more room for more chickens to expand her business. Hawa thanks you for her support!<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":220712,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To build a chicken coop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.78},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:40Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970726},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:38Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886943},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:30Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436203},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130476},{"amount":27.77,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:17Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027278},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613301},{"amount":27.78,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:07Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010384},{"amount":27.79,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:53Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232695},{"amount":27.76,"local_amount":33333.36,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:52Z","rounded_local_amount":36111.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664511}],"funded_date":"2008-11-08T08:48:33Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Wigg","image":1373520}},{"id":76821,"name":"Mrs. Sarun Nop Village Bank Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The village bank which consists of seventeen members is located in Angk Ta Nu village in Takeo Province.

Not having had the chance to go to school due to societal reasons, she chose to work to earn an income.  Thus, she decided to become specialize in making and selling \"djafarana\" powder about 17 years ago.  She learned how to do this from a woman from Cote d'Ivoire who had come to Sikasso to make it her principal business.  \r\n\r\nThis powder, commonly called \u201cdjafarana mugu\u201d or \u201ctamati mugu\u201d, is made with millet, the seeds of the djafarana tree or plant, and shea nut butter.  She pounds the millet and the djafarana seeds to make the powder, to be mixed with shea nut butter, in turn yielding the powder itself as mentioned. \r\n\r\nT\u00e9r\u00e9ko has been collaborating with Soro Yiriwaso for five years now.  After several solidarity loans (group loans) in a women's association of her area, she is on her second individual loan.  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  With the current loan, she intends to buy three sacks of millet, eight sacks of \"djafarana\" seeds, and 30 kg of shea nut butter.  Supplies of the seeds, millet, and the butter are gotten in towns surrounding Sikasso City (Loulouni, Lobougoula, Gnangasso, etc.) by special order. \r\n\r\nHer business cycle is very rapid, and she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 90,000 francs CFA that will be used to ensure that certain expenses are covered, to help her husband support the family, to make loan interest payments, and to invest the rest in her business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

She is 30 years old. Charlen is married and has 3 school-aged children. Charlen owns & operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Charlen has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 5,500 Philippine Pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Charlen joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business. Charlen has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to invest in expanding the business. Charlen is requesting a new loan, her third, of 11,000 PHP, which will also be used to expand the business. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

K., 32, is married to a businessman and they have two children, 6 and 10 years old. Her business is located in a busy market in Mwingi that has a lot of goat selling activities taking place. She is, however, served by the Thika branch of SMEP. She has been in this business for the last three years. She says that the business is profitable and the only major challenge she faces is the means to transport the goats to the market. However, she works very hard to keep her business going well.

Working 7 days a week and 5 hours a day, she supoorts her family. \r\n\r\nShe has already received and successfully repaid 3 loans from Patan BPW and used her most recent one to buy seeds and fertilizers for her farming.  In the future, Rachana plans to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nOver 70% of Nepal's economy is agricultural. Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land. Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (thakari) are the staples of the Nepali diet. With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

He has two children. Yuri is 22 years old, and Joel is 17 years old.  Prudencio lives in his own house and tries very hard to provide a better life for his children.  Prudencio works as a farmer, where he cultivates cocoa plants.  He works very hard on the farming field.  He has been working for 30 years on his own land.  During the planting season, he counts on the support of his children and day laborers who see to the planting and move the collected products to a certain place so that later in can be transported with small vehicles.  He feels very dedicated to his work.  Thanks to his daily effort, today he enjoys seeing his plants give him a good crop.  He says that he does not like the winter season because there is a large quantity of insects and rain during those months, damaging his floral fields.  With the loan that he is asking for, he will buy more pineapple seeds to expand his sown fields.  This is his 11th loan with MFP.  He knows that if he pays it on time, he will be able to obtain another loan with greater ease and will not bring complications to his communal bank where he is well-liked by the rest of the members.  With the 1,000 nuevos soles, he will buy chemical and fertilizer products to maintain his crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":981636,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy chemical and fertilizer products to maintain his plants.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-18T02:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Prudencio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308451261}],"funded_date":"2012-01-18T10:36:53Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:32:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Danielle Dupre","image":170204}},{"id":413879,"name":"Doreces","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Doreces lives in Buluk.

Yudaya takes care of additional family members. The family gets three meals a day.  She incurs additional transport costs to and from shopping in Owino market, one of the busiest markets in Uganda. She sells to all categories of people but mainly to schoolchildren because she resides near the school.

On average, she receives 50 customers a day. Her business premise is her residence. Yudaya has been in this business for eight years and with MCDT for four years, servicing her eighth loan. She has worked all along with the same group mates. Her monthly expenses include school fees for her child and feeding the family. Yudaya wants to use this loan to buy more boxes of biscuits, cooking oil and wheat flour for frying chapatti and samosas.

She works at the business for 12 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Sela currently earns about 150USD from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase more shop items such as cartons of sugar, soap, salt and cooking oil in bulk.  In the future, she plans to increase the size of her business. Sela thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":430610,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more shop items such as cartons of sugar, soap, salt and cooking oil in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":133333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:31Z","rounded_local_amount":138281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757735},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:59Z","rounded_local_amount":138281.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146829},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:32Z","rounded_local_amount":138281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984974},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:02Z","rounded_local_amount":138281.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015647},{"amount":104.16,"local_amount":133333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:49Z","rounded_local_amount":138281.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740653},{"amount":104.17,"local_amount":133333.35,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:13Z","rounded_local_amount":138281.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773767}],"funded_date":"2009-12-02T07:40:42Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":158979,"name":"Nelly Atieno","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nelly Atieno O., 31, is married and has four children ranging from the age of 4 to 13.

Barring the achievements he has registered, he is still behind schedule in many of his other set objectives. It\u2019s for this reason that he wants this loan.

Nurlan Manapovich was born in Orlovka village (Kemin region) where he still lives at the moment. He\u2019s 37 years old. After graduating from school he went into the army. After this, he married Kanaeva Raihan, with whom he has four children: three daughters of school age and a little son who is only one and a half years old. Nurlan works as a security guard in the Altynken goldmine. Nurlan\u2019s spouse is a housewife.\r\n\r\nSince Nurlan is the only breadwinner in a large family, being a hard-working, responsible and enterprising man, he decided to open up a small shop in his garage three years ago. The garage was refurbished into a shop within one week. With a part of his salary of 3,000 Kyrgyz Soms, Nurlan bought groceries. The range of products in his corner shop was not sufficient, and after thinking for a while and considering all the risks, Nurlan got his first loan from Bai Tushum & Partners. Thus, he could widen the range of products and his shop, which he runs with his wife and older children (in their spare time), allows them to earn some extra money. The shop is open 24\/7 and Nurlan has his permanent customers, to whom he gives some discounts and, in case of need, lends goods.\r\n\r\nAbout one month ago, Nurlan\u2019s shop was robbed. More than half of the goods (with a value of 50,000 Kyrgyz Soms) and the sale proceeds of a whole day were stolen. It was a big loss for Nurlan, but he quickly gathered his courage again. In view of the importance of the additional revenue from the shop for his family, Nurlan wants to obtain a loan of 40,000 Kyrgyz Soms to restock his shop with products.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing for Nurlan is his family; he wants to provide his children with a good education. This in turn will allow them help advance their country and their

Currently she only has light services; they are in the process of installing water services. \r\n\r\nFor more than 2 years, she has had a store where she offers a sale to her neighbors and customers in the area on a variety of everyday consumer products including staple items and groceries.

She lives with her partner, 38 year-old Daniel, and they have three children.  They own their own home in Santa Rosa district.\r\n\r\nMarina learned farming techniques and how to care for cacao plantations when she was still very young.  However, things didn't all go well for her and her family.  They suffered some damage to their crops, there weren't any buyers in their community and there were constant landslides in their area.  As a result, everything they invested in their crops was a complete loss.  For two years, Marina was paying off debts that she had with her suppliers and her workers.  However, she recovered her confidence and continued committing herself aggressively to her farming.  This time she sowed a new coffee product.  Since then her sales have increased compared to other years and now she has agreements with her customers.\r\n\r\nIn general, Marina works alongside her husband.  However, at harvest time she needs to hire laborers in order to make her harvesting go more smoothly.  She normally sells her crops to the food warehouses in her community.  Marina will use the loan she has requested to buy cacao plants which she will later graft.  Her future plans are to buy more land and to start growing citrus fruits.\r\n\r\nThis is Marina's eighth loan from MFP and she pledges to continue making her repayments on time.

Con el cr\u00e9dito que solicita, lo invertir\u00e1 en la compra de productos de belleza en la siguiente campa\u00f1a de ofertas.  \n\n","en":"Marisol is 36 years old, single, and she lives in alone in a house she rents. She has been selling beauty products for the past 7 years. Her sales method is to take orders from her clients that choose products from catalogues that Marisol displays. When the products arrive she distributes to the clients who requested them. She has a display case where she displays the various products in stock that way clients have an option on choosing and there are more advantages to gain. She needs a loan to purchase products to have in supply and when they are on sale to immediately offer then at a better price. She will secure more income this way. This is her 4th loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she feels that participating in a group loan has been one of the best decisions she has made with regards to the development of her business. She feels very thankful and she will once again begin this work with the group of her communal bank. She gives her word to keep on being on time with her payments. With the loan that she requests she will invest in the purchase of beauty products on sale in the next campaign."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":770943,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase beauty products for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-19T11:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisol ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200.32},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":218.53},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":221.62},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":236.13},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":245.57},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":253.53},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":265.54},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":276.16},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":286.41},{"due_date":"2012-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":296.19}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.12},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.85},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.37},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.86},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.81},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":98.25},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.18},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105.97},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":74.12,"local_amount":200.32,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":204.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550327},{"amount":80.85,"local_amount":218.53,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:56Z","rounded_local_amount":223.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221719004},{"amount":82,"local_amount":221.62,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":226.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850958},{"amount":178.23,"local_amount":481.7,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:10Z","rounded_local_amount":492,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621234},{"amount":46.88,"local_amount":126.7,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:17:40Z","rounded_local_amount":129.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245200},{"amount":111,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:29:52Z","rounded_local_amount":306.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276714202},{"amount":34.18,"local_amount":92.37,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-16T08:36:42Z","rounded_local_amount":94.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287099049},{"amount":55.5,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:14:37Z","rounded_local_amount":153.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294402125},{"amount":71.59,"local_amount":193.5,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:58:06Z","rounded_local_amount":197.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301456614},{"amount":120.85,"local_amount":326.63,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:35:23Z","rounded_local_amount":333.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308452395},{"amount":69.8,"local_amount":188.63,"processed_date":"2013-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-04-17T16:34:34Z","rounded_local_amount":192.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":355869160}],"funded_date":"2011-06-01T03:53:00Z","paid_date":"2013-04-17T16:34:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":303038,"name":"Santos","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Santos es un joven trabajador  de 24 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltero y vive en casa de su madre en la zona urbana marginal del distrito de M\u00f3rrope - Lambayeque.
