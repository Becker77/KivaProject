In 2001, Halimatu established her provision shop business. She began her business because she gained experience from her husband and the two decided that she should start her own business in a new location. Working seven days a week and 12 hours a day, she earns about Le 1,000,000 every month from this business. She would like a loan in the amount of Le 4,000,000. Halimatu has already received and successfully repaid two loans, and now requires a new loan in order to buy additional provisions such as sugar, sardines, margarine, milk, tea and coffee for her business. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 200,000. In the future, Halimatu plans to build a house of her own.

Silvia has used recent loans to purchase necessary boat supplies, including a motor, fishing net, etc. The boat is used up to five days at a time. When it returns, Silva and the crew share the earnings from fish sales. Silvia earns between 800 to 2000 soles (about $265-$665) each time the boat returns, depending on the catch. Silvia also keeps another smaller fishing boat on the lake in the town of Yarinacocha, where she lives. Silvia's fishing enterprise is going well.  Summer is the best season for catching fish.\r\n\r\nSilvia requests a 3000 soles loan.  Half will be used to purchase another net maD. of a heavier material; better for fishing in the winter season.

Sadiya is a hard working woman and since 2001 has dedicated herself to selling a variety of vegetables. She characterized herself as happy and humble. She started her business with her savings which she had accumulated over a long period of time. Sadiya is the mother of 5 children that she would like to offer an education. Her biggest dream is to prepare her children to have professions so they don't have to suffer like she did since childhood working hard labor. To realize this dream, Sadiya now requests a loan of $800 USD. With this loan she wants to buy more goods to increase her earnings.  \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married to Mr. TOKPANOU Jacques, an employee at the Port of Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin.  Berthe has six children, of whom some are in school.  All of the children live together with their parents.  \r\n\r\nBerthe helps out her husband where it concerns the different family expenses.  She is a gardener who sells her vegetables at the Ganhi market in Cotonou and who also delivers them to retailers.  Dantokpa, the international market of Benin, is where she buys seeds for planting.   She has been in this business for about twenty years and has already obtained an ALID\u00e9 loan, which she has repaid.  It enabled her to build up her business a little.  \r\n\r\nBerthe has the ambition of expanding her garden and selling her vegetables in bulk.  This will enable her to increase her revenues and to address her needs.  She is requesting a second loan from ALID\u00e9 for these reasons.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

called San Miguel Soyaltepec.  This community has a very large lake which provides a lot of fish and work each year.  It is also well known because the Cerro de Oro hydroelectric dam is located there.  This community is where Evaristo A. lives.  He is a young man of 21 who is single and studied up to the sixth year of high school.  \r\n\r\nEvaristo tells us that he left school a couple of years ago.  He needed to work in order to help his parents with their household expenses.  He also tells us that he has a small sales location in his home where he sells groceries but, owing to a lack of money, he had to close it.

He is currently in his 4th year of high school.\r\nHer dream is to improve the quality of the clothing she makes. There are many seamstresses who offer services but don't care about making the customer happy. Lucila hopes her child takes over the business and that she gains the necessary knowledge to be able to run the business. She hopes she becomes successful in life and this would be the perfect career that would make her mother proud.  Lucida does clothing repair and sells clothes.  She currently runs her business from her home, located in Rpto San Carlos 2 Calle.\r\nShe's had her business for 6 years. She began this business going because of the economic need she had at the moment. At the time she suggested making the uniforms for her child's school. (La Asuncion), the school loved the idea and gave her the task of creating these. She was able to increase her earning a bit at a time.\r\nShe's been getting her finance thru Fundaci\u00f3n Leon 2000. At this time she hopes to get a loan in order to purchase: thread, zippers, needles,fabric, scissors, and other things needed to make the uniforms. Some customers have already placed their uniform orders for school year about to come.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Maria Peterson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":260101,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"materials for making school uniforms","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-23T15:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucila Berta ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":14800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1345.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1345.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.18},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":1345.45,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1374.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400003},{"amount":95.23,"local_amount":1879.11,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1919.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092001},{"amount":41.13,"local_amount":811.79,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":829.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985384},{"amount":49.23,"local_amount":971.54,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:11:51Z","rounded_local_amount":992.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446000},{"amount":62.98,"local_amount":1242.86,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1269.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956641},{"amount":92.33,"local_amount":1821.95,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-05T09:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1860.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66055575},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":1345.45,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:29:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1374.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599692},{"amount":68.18,"local_amount":1345.45,"processed_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:57:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1374.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035585},{"amount":25.95,"local_amount":512.08,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:43:22Z","rounded_local_amount":522.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947994},{"amount":110.41,"local_amount":2178.82,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2225.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789968},{"amount":68.2,"local_amount":1345.5,"processed_date":"2009-12-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1374.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680666}],"funded_date":"2009-01-23T17:36:27Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T13:32:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maria Peterson","image":58600}},{"id":89545,"name":"N\u00e9h\u00e9mie Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Deborah is a 42-year-old woman with five children.

She left him in the care of his grandmother and three uncles. \r\n\r\nFidel says that he's happy with his work and thanks to his effort and sacrifice he's earning many projects.\r\n\r\nHe would like a loan to buy shoes and uniforms to sell.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":293962,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Traveling Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy shoes and uniforms to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Carapegua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-25.8 -57.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2009-03-26T07:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fidel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":400000},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27094620},{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T19:42:19Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35988111},{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-05-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:26:14Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44569257},{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:58:44Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52959515},{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-20T09:06:02Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63176786},{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-08-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:49:39Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73602397},{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T18:32:58Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87038627},{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-10-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:04:34Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96951092},{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103793243},{"amount":80,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:46:19Z","rounded_local_amount":411200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110683998}],"funded_date":"2009-03-26T13:46:23Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T13:46:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Bishop","image":107465}},{"id":101833,"name":"Ilqar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ilqar A. is a 28-year-old trader who has been selling food products in his own store for the last eight years.

Hajara doesn\u2019t take care of any additional family members.  The family gets two meals a day. She resides and works in a semi-urban area in the outskirts of Kampala and works two days a week. Hajara sells to all categories of people. Hajara deals in cattle. She buys cows from villages and sells them to meat packers and at times to Kampala city abattoir. She incurs extra transport costs to and from the villages. The major challenges she faces in her business are seasonality and the increasing prices of cattle. Hajara has been in this business for two years. She first dealt in tomatoes.  She has been with MCDT for seven years, servicing her 14th loan working with the same group mates. She wants to use this loan to buy more cattle for resale.

Sarah, a 30-year-old evergreen entrepreneurial upstart, being that she is only five years into her bar business in Kiduusu, Lugazi.

She has been in business for more than 35 years.  Bertila started selling fruits, but now she sells gelatins and desserts that she prepares herself.  The main piece of equipment that she uses for work is her refrigerator.  Every morning she sells these desserts as a street vendor.  Bertila says the days when she sells the most are during the summer season.  She feels very motivated after several hours of walking because she gets to return home without any gelatins and with all the money she has earned in her hands.  These funds go toward covering her household expenses.  Her wish is to improve her business with new implements.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her seventh loan with MFP.  Bertila is very happy to know that she has financial backing, which is why she has already proven herself to be responsible with her payments.  In addition, she is glad to be part of her Communal Bank because all of the members are responsible and cooperative people.

For over a year now, Hellen has been running her own poultry-rearing business to make a living.          \r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Hellen is now requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to purchase more chicken for rearing, and Hellen hopes that the expansion will increase her business profits and allow her to afford to buy sufficient food and, in the future, pay for her university studies.\r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n

Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and local community members. She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every day.\r\n<br>To help her continue to operate her business, Beatriz is requesting a loan of 39,000 PHP. She will use the loan to buy more groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.

Called a chiya pasal, these tea shops make a sweet, milky tea that can be purchased for a few cents a cup.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to keep their store shelves stocked while increasing their profit margins by buying in greater volume. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.

Her oldest child is 30 years old and the youngest is 22.  The family presently resides in the village of Brgy. Rizal, City of Sagay, Negros Occidental. Her husband works in the sugar mill in Sagay, but his income is not enough to sustain all the needs of their family. As a housewife, Lurinada is the one who budgets the family income, and she saw that it was not enough to support their family. She thought that it would be a good idea to have another source of income to supplement her husband's income.  \r\n\r\nTo have access to capital to build her own business, Lurinada joined the Kiva field partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 2000.  With her first loan she set up a general store adjacent to their house.  Even though she  earned only a small income when she started, she persevered and reinvested part of her profits back into the business, and industriously paid her weekly loan installments. As she built her good credit rating with NWTF-Project Dungganon, she was able to access a larger loan, and with it she expanded her business activities and started selling dried fish, which further increased her income potential. \r\n\r\nFor over nine years, she managed to expand her business and this gave her an average monthly net profit of $109, which has been a big help to the family. Lurinada continues to maintain her good credit record: she just paid off her thirteenth loan of PHP 19,500 without a single delay. Now she is borrowing another PHP 19,500 to add to her revolving working capital for her business ventures.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few, but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":392305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She thought that maybe this is because he realized how hard his mother worked just to earn money for their needs. He goes fishing to have his own income for the needs of his own family.\r\n\r\nBeing a mother and a grandparent, Lorna cannot seem to ignore the feeling of guilt when she sees her son and his family suffer from shortage of food and other basic needs.\r\n\r\nWhen Lorna joined ASHI, the loan she requested was used to support her son\u2019s fishing business. She sells the fish caught by her son by going house to house to the people in town, particularly in the neighboring village. The profits of this business are shared with her son and his family. This provides their cash flow and provides them with their basic needs.\r\n\r\nThe income, however, is just too small to support their need to improve their standard of living. Thus, Lorna is now requesting a much larger loan to put up her own businesses which are a variety store and hog\/pig fattening. With an inventory in her store of items most needed by people like rice, charcoal (used to cook food), soap, and beverages, she will gain more customers from around the village.\r\n\r\nThe hogs she fattens can be slaughtered after four months and the meat sold in her store. If not, the pig can also be sold live to a meat vendor in the market.\r\n\r\nLorna is hoping that her envisioned businesses will help her in supporting the financial needs of her two children so that they are able to graduate from college. By then, she thinks their lives would be changed and she will have her dreams fulfilled.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":506297,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery

Three of their children already have their own families. The other 3 are already working and help their parents. They still have one child currently going school.\r\n\r\nHilda has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1995 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her livestock raising and buying and selling of rice grains business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 5,000.\r\n\r\nHilda is now borrowing PHP 23,000 so that she can add additional working capital to her business re-open her general store. This will be her 17th cycle loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Hilda aspires to elevate her family\u2019s living conditions and to ensure their future well-being by following the \u201cDungganon\u201d way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

He lives with his two wives and their chldren in the Dougounina neighborhood of Bougouni. Mr. Sidib\u00e9 did not attend a modern school but rather a Koranic school. In order to support himself, he used a cart to transport the merchandise of Bougouni shopkeepers. After reflecting at length, he decided to learn about the business of buying and selling festival items, shoes and clothing, from his friend. After saving for a few years and with the help of some friends, he decided to open a ready-to-wear shop. After 6 years of experience, he has mastered his business. Within the framework of expanding his business, he decided to affiliate with the Soro Yiriwaso loan program which he knew about from a friend.  He plans to buy shoes, shirt and pants with this loan.  He gets his supplies in Bamako (capital of the Republic of Mali). His clientele is made up of men and women. Religious holidays and important ceremonies (baptism, marriages) are the periods when his sales are the highest.  He expects to make a monthly profit of 50,000 CFA with this loan.  Mr. Sidib\u00e9 hopes to expand his shop in the future.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Connie Archea, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":597122,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy shoes, shirts and pants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Bougouni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.416667 -7.483333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adama ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":150,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:50Z","rounded_local_amount":77523.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476856},{"amount":150,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:14Z","rounded_local_amount":77523.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751997},{"amount":150,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:32Z","rounded_local_amount":77523.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917923},{"amount":150,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-16T08:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":77523.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226185}],"funded_date":"2010-10-09T09:31:50Z","paid_date":"2011-05-16T08:17:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Connie Archea","image":607010}},{"id":233805,"name":"Shalimar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shalimar G. is from the village of Mabasa Dupax del Norte, Nueva Vizcaya.

Five and a half years ago, Deysi started her own business selling perishable goods in the hopes that it would allow her to live better.  The store is located in her house and Deysi tends to her business from Monday to Sunday.  She starts her first chore each day at 6 in the morning and finishes at 10 at night.  Although her work is heavy since she has to tend to customers all day long, it allows her to be at her house and likewise, to sell to her neighbors, who she has known for a long time.  This is why she is requesting a loan through which she will be able to buy a greater quantity of staple products -- above all cold drinks -- in order to improve her sales and offer her two small

She studied up to the sixth semester of high school.  She is married and has two children: one daughter called Bris who is 18 years old and one son called Vladimir who is 21.  They are both university students.  Georgina lives in a community called El Jicaro which is located on the Tierra Blanca-Joachin highway.  This area is noted for being an area where people raise livestock.\r\n\r\nGeorgina tells us that she lived in the State of Mexico for many years but her husband had always wanted to set up a water purifier and when they gathered together enough money to start their own business, they returned to their community to work on their project.  Their purifier is called \"Electrover\".  She tells us that at first it was difficult to attract customers and to get their product accepted but, over time, their efforts paid off and now they have a solid business with a great future.  However, she needs to gradually invest in her business.\r\n\r\nGeorgina says that she and her husband have been in the water purification business for 7 years and, thanks to God, their sales are good.  She needs this loan to invest in buying large water bottles and having their purifier serviced.\r\n\r\nGeorgina and her husband are hoping that this investment will enable them to provide a better service to their customers and a better quality of life to their children.  Georgina also sends thanks to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for the support that they have provided through this loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":761132,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Water Distribution","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to produce purified water and sell the water bottled","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"El Jicaro, Tierra Blanca, Veracruz","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-05-02T21:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Georgina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":625},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":625}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.69},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.69},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.68},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.69},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.69},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.69},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.68},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.69},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.69},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.69},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.68},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.69},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.69},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.69},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.68},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":273.44,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:22:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3159.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211233829},{"amount":218.75,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2527.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512652},{"amount":218.75,"local_amount":2500.41,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:47:56Z","rounded_local_amount":2527.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223298},{"amount":164.06,"local_amount":1874.59,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1895.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201575}],"funded_date":"2011-05-03T02:46:39Z","paid_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":299378,"name":"Leonel Ernesto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":" \nEL SE\u00d1OR LEONEL LABORA COMO COLECTOR DE RUTA ,ES SOLTERO ,TIENE  UN  HIJOS A SU CARGO,ES  ELNOVENO CREDITO  QUE CEPRODEL LE OTORGA, AGRADECE LA OPORTUNIDAD QUE LE HAN BRINDADO  ESTA INSTITUCION  CON LOS DESEMBOLSO QUE LE HAN APROBADO , ESTE CREDITO LO NECESITA PARA INVERTILO  UNA PARTE EN COMPRA DE MERCADERIA PARA SU PEQUE\u00d1O NEGOCIO Y LA OTRAPARA COMPRA DE MATERIALES DE CONSTRUCCION COMO ARENA CEMENTO BLOQUE, HIERRO,PARA AMPLIAR LA SALA  DE SUS VIVIENDA.\n\n","en":"Leonel works as a route collector.

This is Esther from Dar es Salaam, married with three children between the ages of 9 and 17.  Since 2007, Esther has been operating a shop that sells traditional clothing worn by Tanzanian women called kanga and vitenge. The kanga is a piece of printed cotton fabric, often with a border along all four sides, printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. Kitenge (the Swahili plural is vitenge) is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. Kitenge is a communicating textile - the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. <p>\r\n\r\nEsther's business is doing well as she works 12 hours per day, six days per week, earning about $100 monthly from her business. She is requesting a loan of $250 in order to buy more African traditional cloth such as kanga and vitenge. In the future, she plans to increase the stock of African traditional cloths for her shop. Esther thanks you for your support. <p>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":212531,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase traditional African cloth in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-11T13:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esther","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-25T14:32:59Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:22:08Z","rounded_local_amount":60275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348058},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":60275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970641},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:52Z","rounded_local_amount":60275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886858},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":60275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436118},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":60275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130391}],"funded_date":"2008-10-11T14:32:59Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":73193,"name":"Narong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Narong N., 33, and her husband, Mr. Sokha Hul, 36, live along National Road Number One about seventeen kilometers from Phnom Penh.

Basilisa saw that her friends and neighbours needed some financial help and became interested in the credit offered by Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya after meeting with one of their administrators. After that meeting, the members of Amanecer founded their group and have always been extremely responsible with their payments. \r\n\r\nAmanacer's members have small businesses. Basilisa A., Pabla A., Fermina C., and Benigna A. sell meals; Andrea M., Mar\u00eda Angela B., Mar\u00eda Evergista B., and Mar\u00eda Benita Ben\u00edtez sell household goods and hardware supplies; Felicita Pav\u00f3n, Clara B., Carmen D., and Perla L\u00f3pez sell clothing; Elva A. sells vegetables; Sofia E. sells fruit; and Norma D. runs a corner store.\r\n\r\nAll of the group's members are very happy that, thanks to this opportunity, their incomes have risen and they have been able to better their children's quality of life. Having easy access to credit and working capital has made a huge difference for the group, and because they value this, they are very committed to communal banking. They work in solidarity with one another as a team and work to understand and support one another. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Sara Sultan, Kiva

same roof.  She lives in Mile 2 Nkwen, Cameroon, with her entire family, in a house with 5 rooms.<p>\r\n\r\nMirabel has had to overcome some challenges in life, including ill health and  the death of her father.  Since she has been separated from her husband, she has had to take care of her children and pay their school fees alone.<p>\r\n\r\nShe sells food and drink. She plans to use this loan to buy drinks, crates, pots, dishes, groundnuts, and plantains.<p>  \r\n\r\nThis will be Mirabel's fifth time receiving a loan from GHAPE. She has been a member since 2003 and has been quite successful in the past with her business due to its location and her reasonable prices.  Also, due to her experience, she is now having good profits from her business.<p>\r\n \r\nPart of her profits from this loan will be used to take care of her children, buy necessities for the family, and provide good medication for them whenever they are sick. She will invest the rest back into her business. <p>\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing photocopying and encoding services in the local community. Marichu has been engaged in her business for over 3 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Marichu joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marichu has successfully repaid a previous loan of 40,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase materials needed to expand services provided. Marichu is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Marichu from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a very kind and hard-working woman who lives in her own home together with her five dependent children.  What she wants most in life is to provide her children with a good education and a better quality of life.  The hard work which Marcelina does on her farm has meant that her crops are very well cared for and, on the day she sells them, they sell quickly.\r\n\r\nMarcelina's main source of income is selling very good quality cacao, coffee and coca leaves.  What she most likes about her work is harvesting her land since then she feels that her work is bearing fruit.

She lives in the San Antonio neighborhood of the municipality of La Paz. She started her business because her husband abandoned her, and she needed a source of income to raise her children. Since there are no companies in her village where she could look for a job, it occurred to her that she could buy secondhand clothing and set up a small shop in her home. In addition to this, for the past two years, Elsa has operated a food stand in the local school. Her children are longer an economic burden for her, since they are now working, but she helps them with her grandchildren because she loves them very much.

has a very humble plot of land that he uses for rice production. Although he does not have much, it helps make ends meet for Eliceo and his parents. He is not married nor does he have children, but he is still very close to his parents as they live together and work the lands.  He also works at the local rice processing center.  <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> Eliceo is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":25061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-10T16:39:50Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eliceo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-25T20:15:44Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":425,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":60.74}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60.71},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":61,"local_amount":61,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:50Z","rounded_local_amount":61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21389},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T23:18:40Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:50Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40782},{"amount":34,"local_amount":34,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T18:13:34Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:50Z","rounded_local_amount":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45301},{"amount":293,"local_amount":293,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:11:36Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:50Z","rounded_local_amount":293,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99055},{"amount":30,"local_amount":30,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T21:53:54Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:55:50Z","rounded_local_amount":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106815}],"funded_date":"2007-04-11T20:15:44Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T21:53:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11745,"name":"Aurora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aurora is active in the distribution and sale of rice in 100-pound quantities to stores and markets in the area north of Guayaquil.

The living circumstances are not very good. The houses are not well equipped and often lack running water. Therefore they talk a lot about how to improve their lives. One of the members of this group once heard of micro-finance and started searching for a way to arrange this for them. They contacted Friendship Bridge and after a successful first loan, this is going to be their second loan now.\r\n\r\nThe women of this group have daily food stores and raise cattle. One of them also has chickens, and Rosa S. buys and sells candles. The president of the Group is called Clavia, who buys corn in Solol\u00e1. She takes this to Patzutzun to sell to all her friends, family, and neighbours. They all go to the local millers to have their corn ground into flour, to make their delicious tortillas. The fact that there is a miller in their village saves them a lot of work, not having to do the grinding by hand, says Clavia. \r\n\r\nMercedes, who is here with her daughter, will buy a new bull and all the necessities, such as food and fencing, to take care of him. When he is big and strong, she will sell him. It was Mercedes who initially started using credit this way. She has done it several times now. Her daughter Eusebia is going to follow her mom's example. This is a reasonably steady business, she tells me while holding the tiniest baby on her arm! When I ask them why they don't buy a cow to produce calves, they tell me that it is a very different business to raise young cattle. Cows are also not easy to find and much more expensive. And since working with the bulls is something they have a lot of experience with, their buyers already know the good quality of their bulls.\r\n\r\nRosa is a very good cook and people buy her tortillas as far away as Guatemala City! She runs her business with the help of her daughter. Her daughter makes the 2-3 hour journey a couple of times a week to sell her mother's tortillas. Maria is hoping to expand her store to be able to sell different products in the future. Next to her sits Antonia, who wants to do the same and eventually improve her home.  \r\n\r\nAntonia also wants to provide her children with their own bed and better school clothes. All her hard work is for one purpose only: to give her kids the best she can. And when I ask whether all the kids go to school they answer as one person: YES! \r\n\r\nAll of them are very determined to ensure their children will have better and more education than they had themselves.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3550,"image":{"id":191596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":212564,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy fish","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-11T16:20:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asmin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-25T17:45:09Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70000},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":70000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":60,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2008-11-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:22:43Z","rounded_local_amount":72330,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348071},{"amount":60,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2008-12-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:13:23Z","rounded_local_amount":72330,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970657},{"amount":60,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:15:53Z","rounded_local_amount":72330,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886874},{"amount":60,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:04:15Z","rounded_local_amount":72330,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436134},{"amount":60,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:18Z","rounded_local_amount":72330,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130407},{"amount":59.99,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:48Z","rounded_local_amount":72330,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027209},{"amount":60,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:11Z","rounded_local_amount":72330,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613247},{"amount":60,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:18Z","rounded_local_amount":72330,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010330},{"amount":60.01,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":72330,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232641},{"amount":60,"local_amount":70000,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:30Z","rounded_local_amount":72330,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664457}],"funded_date":"2008-10-11T17:45:09Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kay and Fred Tierney","image":92188}},{"id":73209,"name":"Florian","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or Flori\u00e1n cuenta con 37 a\u00f1os de edad, su pareja es la Se\u00f1ora.

This loan is their fifth as they have repaid all four previous loans.\r\n\r\nThey live in large families in the village of Kimparana where they have a variety of businesses such as selling food, rice, beans and yams.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to buy bags of rice and beans at a reasonable price as it is harvest time.\r\n\r\nThey sell food in diners or walking in the marketplace or at crossroads.  They buy their rice in Koury, Kimparana and Niokoyiri; it is sold dry or prepared on the spot.  They make an average profit of 175,000 FCFA per cycle.\r\n\r\nIn addition to repaying the loan interests to Soro Yiriwaso, the members of Benkadi use part of their savings to increase their businesses and pay household expenses.  In the future, the Benkadi group wants to continue working with Soro Yiriwaso in the hope of borrowing more substantial amounts.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1800,"image":{"id":260449,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy various goods for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Chitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rokia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sanata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Haoua ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":900000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":150000},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":150000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-02-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:12:33Z","rounded_local_amount":151316.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440341},{"amount":300,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:08:21Z","rounded_local_amount":151316.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135719},{"amount":300,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:44Z","rounded_local_amount":151316.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033520},{"amount":300,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:39:10Z","rounded_local_amount":151316.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620888},{"amount":300,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:47Z","rounded_local_amount":151316.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019853},{"amount":300,"local_amount":150000,"processed_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:27Z","rounded_local_amount":151316.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242611}],"funded_date":"2009-02-03T18:21:11Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":89593,"name":"Vanessa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Vanessa tiene 20 a\u00f1os de edad, vive cerca de 5 a\u00f1os con su pareja y tienen un hijo, viven en una casa alquilada donde realizan sus negocio de venta de golosinas y gaseosas.

They live in a house they've rented and where they run their business selling snacks and soft drinks. Previously she cultivated a field with her husband; but produce isn't that profitable in certain seasons, so she opened a store to sell snacks and soft drinks 8 months ago, and finding it very profitable. In the first loan she received from MFP (Kiva Field Partner) she managed to purchase a stand, but now with this loan she wants to stock her store with more products. Vanessa loves to be in contact with people, and in doing so she is generating an income for herself, and meanwhile her husband dedicates his time to cultivate fruit that in certain seasons they produce fruit in great quantities, something they hope to keep harvesting. Vanessa's goal is to have her own fields to no longer have to pay rent on the building where she has her store. She sought the community bank in her third loan cycle and her history indicates that she makes payments on time, on this her second loan from MFP, an institution of which she feels part.

He is referred to as \"the tenant farmer\", since he is a farmer that works the land of farms that he leases, farms on which he also lives.  He has been doing this all his life, growing large quantities of potatoes and beans in each of the farms.  At harvest time, he goes to live on the farm, constructing a hut near his crop so that he can stop any robbery of his new bean harvest.  Of all his crops, beans are the most profitable and requiring the least amount of work, that is why he does not stop growing them and during the picking months he gets persons to help with the work.  Once harvested, he collects his production in an appropriate place until he has picked all the green beans at which point he sells them in the markets of the city.  This work process has proven to be very profitable for him and he is thinking of buying his own land with the gains, this way he can establish himself in one place.  Angel has been working with MFP for the last three loans. during which time he has paid his installments on time before any of the other members.  The money that he is now requesting will buy fertilizers for his green bean crop.

Anarkan D., leader of the group, is one those women. She is 53 and divorced. She raised 4 children alone with the help of her business. Now her elder son is 25 and he works as foreman in the company named \u201cAlyukobond\u201d, her second son works in Russia, her daughter is seamstress and the youngest son is a student. \r\n\r\nBut 22 years ago she had to start her business alone in order to provide her children only with a calf that was given by her relatives as a present for the birth of her second child in compliance with Kyrgyz national traditions.  Using the calf meat and initial investments of 3,000 soms, she started doing and then selling meat dumplings. Now she has hired two assistants who make 20 kilograms of meat dumplings a day. Her business brings her 1,000 soms monthly. \r\n\r\nIn order to increase her profits she is planning to buy small cattle, fatten it for slaughter and use this meat in making meat dumplings. Unfortunately, she doesn\u2019t have sufficient funds, therefore she is applying for a loan. This loan will help Anarkan reduce the costs on the purchase of meat and as a result increase her profits. \r\n\r\nGroup members:\r\nNargiza D. is the treasurer of the group.  She is 32 and married. She has a son of 14 years.  Her husband is working as a driver on the fish-factory. She works as a seamstress. Still, their wages are not enough to cover their living expenses. Thus, they started seven years ago their own family business. Mainly, this business is on Nargiza because her husband is working in the capital of Kyrgyzstan \u2013 Bishkek. When their son became 5, their relatives gave them as a present a calf. With this calf she started her business. She fattened it and then sold it. So this is how she started her business of buying, fattening and selling a calf with the purpose of making profit. Monthly she gets 1,200 soms. For now, due to the successful functioning of her business, she can make capital repairs to her house. She is applying for loan in order to continue her business. But now she wants not just to sell a calf but also she is considering an opportunity of exchanging it for a milk cow and then selling milk in the mornings. \r\n\r\nIbarat K. is 53 and widow. She has 3 children. Her first son is 23, her second son is 21 and both of them work as builders. Her daughter is 16 and she is student. During her summer break, she works as washerwoman at car wash. Since the situation in the country changed a lot, she lost a job and it forced her to consider options of starting her own business. She decided to breed cattle. She is almost three years in cattle breeding business. She started it with initial investments of 2,000 soms and it brings her monthly 1,700 soms. On the money received as profits from her business, she is able to pay tuition fee for her daughter at her institution of higher education and she could buy household appliances for her house. Now, she needs funds to buy another calf, fatten it and sell it. Therefore, she is applying for a loan which will help her to develop her business. \r\n\r\nNazarbek K. is 42 and married. He is a builder in the capital of Kyrgyzstan \u2013 Bishkek. He has 3 children. The elder son is 15, his second son is 13, his little daughter is 7 and all of them go to school. His wife is working at the grill factory. Still, in order to have enough money to provide his family, he started breeding cattle. Here, his elder son and his wife assist him while he is at work. They started breed cattle upon the advice of his wife\u2019s parents to buy a calf, fatten and sell it. He is 10 years in the cattle-breeding business with an initial investment of 4,000 soms. This business brings 1,300 soms monthly. On the profits from his business, he could provide his family, pay for their education and make partial capital repairs of his house. Now, he applying for a loan to buy a calf, fatten and sell it. After selling it, he is planning to add money and to buy a milk cow and then sell milk. This will help him to increase his profits from business and make him closer to his dream to build a big and beautiful house.   \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Along with the above-mentioned, Lia and David run a sheep-breeding farm, which consists of 40 sheep and lambs. They sell lambs in the spring season. The total average monthly income of the family is 750 Laris, including the pension of Lia\u2019s parents-in-law. \r\n\r\nThough the family has quite a strong farm, they still are faced by lack of cash for financing seasonal costs. Because of this, Lia requested a loan for mowing Lucerne (to hire special mowing machinery) and purchasing fertilizers for their melon garden. Mowed Lucerne will be stored and sold. After fertilizing the land, the family will get more harvest and thus more income from sales. \r\n\r\nThe increase in income will be used for financing Lia\u2019s daughter\u2019s education in high school. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":792443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire a mowing machine and purchase fertilizers for melon garden.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GE","country":"Georgia","town":"Kakabeti","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42 43.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":181,"posted_date":"2011-06-17T23:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"GEL","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2012-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":122.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.75},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.75},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":183.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":122.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:40:32Z","rounded_local_amount":202.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232843753},{"amount":183.75,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:47:53Z","rounded_local_amount":303.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238658612},{"amount":183.75,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:35:56Z","rounded_local_amount":303.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244612668},{"amount":183.75,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:43:14Z","rounded_local_amount":303.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250827922},{"amount":183.75,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:09:12Z","rounded_local_amount":303.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257238115},{"amount":183.75,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:21:37Z","rounded_local_amount":303.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263377549},{"amount":183.75,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:19:26Z","rounded_local_amount":303.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270091267}],"funded_date":"2011-06-18T11:05:37Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:19:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":311700,"name":"Janeffer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Janeffer is a 37-year-old business lady who has been selling shoes for seven years.

Luis is a hardworking man who takes responsibility for his family. He is a man of good character. Luis' business is selling animals, especially pigs, guinea pigs, and cattle at the market. He began this business when he married over 20 years ago. Luis began by selling animals to his neighbors. Now, 20 years later, he uses micro loans to more easily obtain the capital necessary to purchase animals to sell at a profit. Earlier in the history of his business, he used to obtain his capital from loan sharks who charged him daily for their money-lending services. Luis works with his wife, who is pictured beside him in the photo. Luis reports that his business is going well and with the earnings he sees, he invests in the education of his children. His loan will be used to purchase more pigs. His past loans have given him the opportunity to buy his animals, pay a low interest rate, and get his loan quickly so he could get to work. Luis\u2019 dream is to build a new house on new land in the next year. He wants to continue his work with his business and support his family.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, Luis and his wife are pictured with their guinea pigs, as Luis had not yet had the opportunity to purchase the pigs that this loan will finance.

She is also happy and kind, and she lives with Marco, who is employed. She lives in the company of her mother, her sister, her boyfriend, and their five-month-old son, all in her mother's house.\r\n\r\nMaudi's business is selling soft drinks. She depends on a freezer that she bought with the support of her boyfriend. She got her start with capital which came from her own savings and was used to purchase a case of soft drinks to begin with.\r\n\r\nShe sells all day long, and at night she sells fast food such as roasted chicken and sausage with fried chicken. For that work she counts on her food cart. She has been doing both of these activities for two years, relying on help from her mother for customer service. She likes her business because it allows her to stay home and take care of her son, and the income helps her pay for household expenses.\r\n\r\nThanks to good earnings from regular customers she handles, she wants to continue with the business and expand into soft drink distribution in the future. This will be her first loan with MFP, and she is thankful for the financial support. Thanks to this she will be able to move forward with her business. With the amount she requested, 800 nuevos soles, she will invest it entirely in buying drinks such as sodas at wholesale prices in order to have a bigger profit margin.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":941445,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy cases of soft drinks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-12-10T17:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maudi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":119.43},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":126.89},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":126.27},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":137.51},{"due_date":"2012-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":143.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":146.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.79},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.35},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.57},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.72},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":44.79,"local_amount":119.43,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:49:41Z","rounded_local_amount":120.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836302},{"amount":47.58,"local_amount":126.89,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:50Z","rounded_local_amount":128.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257246063},{"amount":47.35,"local_amount":126.27,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":127.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263386083},{"amount":51.57,"local_amount":137.51,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":138.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099172},{"amount":53.72,"local_amount":143.26,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:01Z","rounded_local_amount":144.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713327},{"amount":54.99,"local_amount":146.64,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":148.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283202208}],"funded_date":"2011-12-10T20:05:00Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T18:29:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tamara Hellgren","image":null}},{"id":373201,"name":"Roda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Roda is a 23-year-old married woman with two children; one in school.
