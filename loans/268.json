This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":303382,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"To pay school fees for her children","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ester B.

She still lives in the town where she was born and has the land she inherited from her parents. She uses it to earn an income and support her family. She gets up early every day to take care of her animals, which she will sell, along with manure, at livestock markets in the area. At harvest time, she sells her products by direct sale in the market, thereby earning more profit. Her male children help her with the harder tasks like lifting and moving sacks. In the future, CarmeL. wants to have more sheep and young bulls so they produce more manure to sell.  This is her 14th loan with MFP. She is one of the longest standing members of her communal bank, and the one that always works towards collaboration.

(Confidence and Development), and his story is representative of his group and of Esperanza's Dominican and Haitian (many of whom recently emigrated to the DR from Haiti) clients generally. His group is located in the areas surrounding San Pedro De Macoris, an agricultural area once booming with the sugar industry, where running water (none of which is potable) and electricity are unreliable. He makes his home here in a simple structure as a single father with three kids.\r\n\r\nHector is excited to be taking out his sixth loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid his previous loans and grown his business. He plans to use this loan to invest in his business selling dulce de coco, a sort of candy covered concoction of ground coconut and milk, which he sells from his motorcycle. He will invest by purchasing the necessary ingredients of milk, coconut and sugar, he also has his eye out for a suitable machine to grind the coconuts with.

Eseza has been in this business for eight years and with MCDT for eight years now servicing her eleventh loan working with the same group mates.

Manabi.  She is a nursing assistant in a provincial hospital and also distributes water.  For her, the most important thing is to work and make a good living.  Her husband works as a chauffeur in school transportation.  In order to earn more money, she sells clothing to her colleagues at the hospital and to her friends at work.  To supply her business, she buys merchandise from Guayaquil and every time she has an order, she must travel to pick it up.  In the hospital, Ms. Angela works six hours daily.  The rest of the time she works at her other businesses.  She also gives credit to her customers.  She plans to invest her loan in merchandise and also to the sale of Avon products because she is a distributor in Manabi.  The company sends her the products from Quito and she distributes them to the clients.  Ms. Angela's dream is that all of her children work and never lack anything.  She is 52 years old and has been married for 29 years.

She learned sewing from her mother and spent several years in apprenticeship.\r\n \r\nShe has been working on her own for 16 years. Her workshop at the M\u00e9dine market is easily accessible, which is one of the reasons for the high customer traffic.\r\n\r\nShe enjoys great reputation and notoriety as her pillows and clothes are in high demand in S\u00e9gou.\r\n\r\nIn order to better serve her increasing client base, she turned to the Soro Yiriwaso micro-finance institution. This is her first individual loan, which she intends to use to buy a new CORNA sewing machine in S\u00e9gou.\r\n\r\nAmidatou sells the clothes that she makes (often on order) for cash to a clientele consisting of both men and women.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, she hopes to earn a monthly profit of 100,000FCFA. This will enable her to manage her daily life.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to expand her workshop and train numerous employees.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Nathalie Pelletier, Kiva

Geronima M. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

That way she will achieve important growth that will generate greater income.\n\nGladys lives in a traditional tourist neighborhood with immense colonial houses.  It borders upon the Cartagena Bay and a growing commercial sector, which is very close to the city harbor.

Her business is always well stocked.  She is now applying for her first loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.

She says she began her involvement in this trade with no experience but casting her mind back, she says the fact that many people consumed fresh fruit and vegetables back in the day came in really handy.\r\n\r\nCate took stock of the fact that her business would benefit more if she started planting her own fruits and vegetables. She embarked on fruit and vegetable farming some years later and to a greater magnitude, it has lent countenance to her business transactions. Cate sells fresh pumpkins, sweet bananas, onions, tomatoes, apples, oranges, etc. Monthly she says her sales profits add up to Uganda shillings 200,000.\r\n\r\nCate reckons she will at length be able to earn more once she gets this loan. Cate says she is to use her Kiva loan to purchase more high value pumpkin, tomato and pineapple seeds to replant. She says if she starts harvesting on  a bigger scale, her odds of further financial success are in the ascendant.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4275,"image":{"id":870689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

She hails from a Schedule Tribe (ST) family. Schedule Tribe people in India are considered to be one of the most underdeveloped community. The majority people of them are socially, educationally and economically deprived. \n\nShrimati Purnnami, the confident lady standing with raised hand in the photo, hails from this background. She is a married lady of 27 years having a daughter of 8 years and a son of 6 years. She resides in a small house with her husband and children. \n\nShrimati Purnnami is basically a farmer. She and her husband do various types of cultivation in their land. They cultivate mainly vegetables, ground nuts and onion in the field. She has also a dug well in the plot from where she uses the water for cultivation. Shrimati Purnnami uses the traditional water lifting system and irrigates her land, which is very time taking and difficult work. In spite of her interest to cover the entire area for cultivation, she could not do this due to this factor. \n\nThe income which she earns from the above business is not sufficient to maintain her family and invest for the cultivation work. Therefore, she wants to expand her business by taking a loan. So she motivated nine other women from her village and formed the SHG (self-help group) named Durga, contacted Mahashakti Foundation and took a loan of 120,000 INR. Shrimati Purnnami has taken 12,000 INR from that, and she will utilize the present loan to buy a water pump; ground nut, onion and vegetable seeds; fertilizer; and pesticides for her farm. She expects that this investment will save her time and energy to obtain a good return. Shrimati Purnnami dreams to construct a house and of a better education of her son. She hopes to give her family a bright future through her hard work.\n\nAmong the other nine members, seven members are doing vegetable cultivation and two members are doing animal trading businesses. They are also very much hopeful to increase their income by investing the present loan in a proper manner for better livelihoods.

Zoya, selling sporting goods has been a family business. She and her husband have successfully operated two sales kiosks for nearly eleven years, one located in a market and another at a nearby shopping center, that offer a variety of sports related clothing and equipment. Zoya and her husband have sought to create an atmosphere that encourages customers to come back to their stores. One of the ways they have tried to accomplish this is to consistently replenish their stock with newer products. Their current net profit amounts to around $400 per month.\r\n\r\nZoya is an entrepreneur who is full of life. Her ability to accomplish her goals makes her a solid client with Nadiya Ukraine. Her entrepreneurial spirit and good relationship with customers has helped place the business in a favorable position to grow. Ensuring growth for the business will allow her to see her daughter receive a college education upon her graduation from high school this year.  \r\n\r\nZoya has requested $1200 in order to purchase spring items such as shorts and t-shirts and some additional sports equipment. She and her husband want to be prepared for what they hope will be another busy and profitable sports season in the Ukraine.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u0411\u0456\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441 \u0437

When he was little and in school he took his father\u2019s bulls and cows out to pasture.  Huge bulls and cows listened to the little boy.  While the herd grazed Abdumubin did his homework and read books.  In the evening he brought the herd home.  That is why he developed a love of animals from childhood.  According to his father, since childhood Abdumubin wanted to build a farm that fed livestock.  He is also a butcher. <p>\r\n\r\nToday, Abdumubin has his own family \u2013 a wife and 3 children.  The youngest is not yet one.  Abdumubin lives with his family in his parents\u2019 home, since he is the youngest child in the family.  The dream of his childhood \u2013 the feeding of livestock has become his sole source of income.  Sometimes he earns extra income by working as a taxi driver using his old car.  During this time his wife and father look after the livestock at home.  To expand his livestock Abdumubin turned to MLF MicroInvest and after getting a loan of $950 purchased four small bulls.  The loan assisted him in earning extra profits.  Abdumubin keeps all records of the business \u2013 revenues, cost and profits \u2013 in a special notebook.  Profits from feeding livestock are good right now, because upkeep is cheaper in the summer.  Abdumubin will use the new loan to continue his business.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Sabina H., Kiva

She has many children, but she earned her living solely from a couple acres of rice-field.  In August 2002, Mr.s H. joined TYM Fund.  With her initial loan of 60USD, she buy and raise pigs.  Years after years, she has becomes more confident with her ability to manage the loan.  With her experience and self confidence, Mrs. H. is applying for a loan of 750USD.  She wants to use this money to buy pigs, soybean to make tofu and mash to make wine.  She just bought a machine to make tofu, so her production has increased significantly (On average, she sells 30 to 50 kilogram tofu per day).  Mrs. H. uses by-products from making wine to feed her pigs.  Every year she sells 4 litters of pigs (which weigh about 2 to 3 tons).  Her husband is a farmer.  He often helps her with her job, so she can have time to participate in her cluster activities as well as other hamlet and commune activities in general.  Everybody in her commune trusts and respects her.  Mrs. H. was appointed one of TYM\u2019s best entrepreneurs in 2006.  She hopes to continue to be member of TYM Fund, so that she can have bigger loan to expand her business. \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Phuong Nguyen, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nTr\u01b0\u1edbc n\u0103m 2002, \u0111i\u1ec1u ki\u1ec7n gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ecb H\u1eadu g\u1eb7p nhi\u1ec1u kh\u00f3 kh\u0103n, nh\u00e0 \u0111\u00f4ng con, ngo\u00e0i l\u00e0m m\u1ea5y s\u00e0o ru\u1ed9ng ra gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb c\u0169ng kh\u00f4ng bi\u1ebft l\u00e0m g\u00ec th\u00eam n\u00ean cu\u1ed9c s\u1ed1ng \u0111\u00e3 kh\u00f3 kh\u0103n l\u1ea1i c\u00e0ng kh\u00f3 kh\u0103n h\u01a1n.

At the moment, I work as a full-time employee on the Espejo Family Estate, which is located in Valle del Carmen in the community of Yungaqui.  For 25 years I have worked with the family and my duties include milking the cows, watering the fields, planting and harvesting potatoes, and making cheese.  I also live in my own house and have small plots of land on which I plant and harvest seasonal crops.  When I started, it was difficult at first because I did not have much capital.  At that point, I was presented with the opportunity to join a Communal Bank with Asociaci\u00f3n Araiwa and receive support through monetary loans that I could use to start and improve my business.\u201d\r\n\r\n\"From that point, life for myself and my family began to change because we had access to capital.  My wife and I, as well as our children, felt we could work toward changing the financial situation of our family.  At that moment, I wanted to grow my business.  I am currently requesting a loan to buy compost, seeds, and other supplies.  For this reason I am extremely grateful to my Communal Bank and Asociaci\u00f3n Araiwa because they have changed my life, not only financially, but socially as well.  No other financial institution wanted to trust us.  Most of them asked for too many requirements and suddenly we did not matter to them.  This is why I am very thankful to have my own capital so that I can better manage my own business.\"\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":564938,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase compost, seeds, and other supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Yungaqui - Anta - Anta - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucho Quintin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":75.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":78.39},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":81.53},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":84.79},{"due_date":"2010-11-27T08:00:00Z","amount":88.18},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":91.73}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.15},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.36},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.61},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.92},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.27},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.69}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":217093,"name":"Bushra's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bushra is 30 years old, married, and a mother of two daughters.

She  prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives, the follow-up, and the low cost of obtaining and paying back a loan.\r\n\r\nAbout GHAPE:\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multifaceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":596542,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase yams seeds, poultry and pig farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Musang, Bamenda, NW.

William started Bella Videography six years ago and has over 25 years of industry experience.  He worked at the Houston Independent School District for 16 years before deciding to open Bella Videography, a decision he has never regretted.  He loves being able to do what he loves and advises prospective entrepreneurs \u201cto take the plunge\u2026 if you never do it, you\u2019ll never know.\u201d\r\n\r\nBorn in Colombia, William came to the United States when he was three years old.  Being fluent in Spanish helps William market to Houston\u2019s Hispanic population, and is especially useful when dealing with older clients who don\u2019t speak English.  Houston\u2019s warm climate makes for a non-traditional, year-round wedding season that keeps William on the run.  A typical week for William has him editing footage during the business week and working events on the weekend.  He hires hourly, part-time employees who help him with events requesting multiple cameras. \r\n  \r\nWhen the recession hit a couple of years ago, business slowed as people were forced to shrink their wedding budgets.  William turned what looked to be a bad situation into a positive one for his business by creating a less expensive package that still offered clients a high-quality product.   He says that if your business can\u2019t change with the environment, you won\u2019t stay in business.  In the six years William has been in business, revenues have increased every year.\r\n\r\nThis is William\u2019s third loan with ACCION Texas-Louisiana.  William is using this loan to purchase a new camera that will increase product quality.  With technology continually improving, it is critical that William\u2019s equipment be up-to-date so that he can provide his customers with the best quality footage.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3175,"image":{"id":757626,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Photography","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

These products are used by the women who make chicha de jora (a traditional Peruvian beverage made from fermented corn.)  He has been doing this type of work since he was very young.  It has now been 10 years since he began to work independently doing this type of work that he knows so well.  He has an established customer base because of all of his years of experience.   It's worth noting that he also sells goats and barnyard fowl; this activity provides him with extra income for his household.\r\n\r\nMartin is requesting a loan of 1,000 Peruvian soles from Edpyme Alternativa to invest in his business.

very pleased to present to you teachers of a leading secondary school in Makeni. Seventeen out of the 70 staff of this institution have come to SMT to apply for a loan of 15,440,000.00 Sierra Leone leones (SLL). School staff from this institution and indeed, from many other institutions in different walks of life within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. These loans are helpful as they can allow them invest in something that their salaries alone cannot do. For example, some of them may buy a plot of land, others will buy house-building materials, some will buy household furniture, some will use the loan to pay school fees for their children, while others will use the loan to invest in his\/her business. At the end of each month, the institution\u2019s bursar deducts the repayment from their salaries and repays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nZainab (third from left) is a senior teacher at the school and leader of this group of teachers. The 47-year-old woman is married and has five children. She has been in the teaching profession for 26 years. A native of Makeni, Zainab backs her teaching profession with some trading. She supplies cosmetics \u2013 body sprays, body powders, etc. Zainab has requested this loan in order to buy more goods to add to her business.

","en":"Ericson is 27, single and lives in his parents' home with his siblings.  He is a teacher, working in the jungle of Peru since 2005.  This work fills him with satisfaction that he has lent his services to the children of this area, so remote where because of distance and lack of funding they cannot buy all the school supplies they need.  Because of this he sells books and other articles and is paid in installments so that his kids can have the tools they need to study.  In view of the reality he faces, Ericson brings notebooks, pencils, erasers, crayons and so on.  He distributes them to his students and is repaid over time.  Providing this service to his students gives him pleasure and fills him with satisfaction.  At the same time, it is profitable and is an extra income which often pays for his travel expenses.  Ericson tells us that because of his work he sometimes misses community bank meetings but he has entrusted his mother with paying his loan on time.  This is his second loan with MFP and in all this time he has proven himself responsible in repaying on time.  He will use the loan to buy school supplies and in this way support these children of the Peruvian jungle.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":272032,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more school supplies to resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-18T02:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ericson","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":115}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.61,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":122.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423765},{"amount":37.61,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2009-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:42Z","rounded_local_amount":122.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117077},{"amount":37.6,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:50:27Z","rounded_local_amount":122.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011990},{"amount":37.61,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:56Z","rounded_local_amount":122.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595575},{"amount":37.61,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:00Z","rounded_local_amount":122.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989837},{"amount":36.96,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:44Z","rounded_local_amount":120.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210973}],"funded_date":"2009-02-18T02:25:23Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":93349,"name":"Ata Mohammad","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ata M. is the son of M.

She is 46 years old and determined to bring her eight children out of poverty. She is married to Braulio, who is 55 years old.\r\n<p>\r\nWith her desire to step out from the spiral of poverty, in 2008 she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines. She is hopeful to have access to capital for her business selling food, such as pork barbeque, grilled hot dogs, fish balls and other similar foods. She uses her tri-bike as a cart in roaming around the village. Her business is a favorite of kids during the afternoon, and the men who are drinking beer buy barbeque.\r\n<p>\r\nAlicia is now on her third loan. She proposes to borrow 14,000 pesos to pay for one sidecar, pork, hot dogs, fish balls, frying pans, and a stove. She hopes that through her business, she can reach her dreams of sending her children to school until college and of renovating her house to make it more spacious and

He believes that having his own business has helped him progress in life - there is so much that he learns from owning his own business that he applies to all aspects of his life.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the success he feels from being able to provide for his family, Julio has felt a huge sense of success being able to provide a service to his community. The extra income that he earns also goes to support his aging parents back home in the Dominican Republic.\r\n\r\nWith the loan from ACCION USA, Julio will use 75% to buy new cell phones and accessories and 25% on promotions. He will need the extra stock in inventory to support all of the clients that will be coming through his doors.\r\n\r\nJulio is very positive about his business and believes that this loan from ACCION USA will be a big help to his success.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":465081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Mobile

Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

She is 59 years old. Monica is the group leader of a three-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nMonica is married and has seven adult-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a general store, selling household items in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately $200 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Monica joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1,700 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase rice. Monica is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be her 2nd loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to provide the needs of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

She has been in this field for 26 years and thinks that the most difficult aspect of her job is having to transport her produce all the way to Tarma, since the sacks that she carries are very heavy and wear her out. In the future, she would like to purchase more crop fields so that she can increase production. This is her sixth loan with MFP. She has been very punctual in repaying her previous loans and hopes to continue this way. She is a very active member of the group who is always aware of her fellow group members' agreements. With the 1,000.00 PEN that she is requesting, she will purchase more fertilizer for her fields. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":565000,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizer to improve the quality of her crops ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-09T06:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:37Z","rounded_local_amount":1059.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195419}],"funded_date":"2010-07-09T10:02:27Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":217109,"name":"Robelinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Robelinda L. is from the village of Tabo-o, Jimenez, Misamis Occidental.

He is a very unpretentious and hard working young man. He lives in a rented house together with his wife Lisbeth, 21 years old, and their only son, Junior who is 10 months old. They are the reason for all of his efforts. In the comfort of his home Harold has an oven. He starts baking very early in the morning to fill all the orders he has received from his clients. He works together with his wife Lisbeth and together they bake breads. The oven belongs to them both. He very much enjoys his work, especially baking cakes. He has 15 years' experience in the field. The most difficult part of the work is baking breads because he always has to give special care to not over bake them. In the future he hopes to set up a store from where they can sell their baked goods themselves. This is the first loan through MFP (Kiva Field Partner). He knows that if he pays his loan back on time he will have access to future loans and not bring any difficulties to his community bank. He is very well liked by the other members of the group. The one thousand nuevos soles that he requests will be invested in the purchase of ingredients to bake more delicious breads. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":596588,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase ingredients for his bakery.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-07T17:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Harold ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1048.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549377}],"funded_date":"2010-09-07T18:49:33Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":233497,"name":"Amer","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Amer is a 34-year-old married man from Chtoura and is the father of three children.

That is why Zenaida works hard to make sure she doesn't get behind because of the lack of ability to perform well--be it in business or in her family life. At 60, she is a persevering micro entrepreneur, a loving life partner and mother, and a dedicated community partner in CCT*. She co-heads a family with Salvador. They reside in General Mariano Alvarez (GMA), Cavite, south of Manila.\n\nZenaida currently runs her own sari-sari (variety) store. Aside from handpicking brands and products that suit the tastes of her customers, Zenaida also sells fresh fish for her fellow community members. She makes sure she delivers only the best food for them. Her space is located in the community market in GMA. Also, she rents out an apartment to workers who choose to live independently. Monthly she is able to earn PHP 11,900.\n\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she has applied for a loan of PHP 17,000. This she will use to purchase more stocks of products like canned goods and soft drinks, sugar and coffee and liters of cooking oil. She also intends to make fresh fish available for her customers on a regular basis. According to Zenaida, this loan will help her earn more and thus save more for the schooling of her children.\n\nZenaida admits that there are times when the sales are so low she doesn't seem to make any profit at all. She also confesses that it's hard to do business alone since her husband had a stroke. But Zenaida does not want any incapability to hinder her from receiving God's best for her. She aims to make up for what is lost and make her store grow even more. Aside from building her own apartment, she also hopes to have her own vehicle for delivery, which the family can also use to attend activities at church. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\n\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\n\n

When she joined the Fund in 1998, her family\u2019s financial conditions encountered many difficulties. Her husband had died early, when all children were still young and there was not enough capital to make a living. After joining the Fund, she borrowed money to buy and resell scrap. Over her 10 years of participation to the Fund, she managed to raise all the children thanks to her assiduous work and thriftiness. The 3 eldest children are now grown up and her family\u2019s economy has improved significantly. The children currently work in the family\u2019s carpentry business. For the next round, she would like to borrow 10.000.000 \u0111 for the children to purchase a new sawing machine, and use the remainder of the loan to buy scrap.

from Tanzania! Tabitha is a thirty-six-year-old married woman with three children between the ages of five and fourteen. She lives in Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital of Tanzania, where she opened a clothing store called Tabby Designs in 2006. She runs the store with one employee and the assistance of her children, all of whom are also enrolled in school. Tabitha sells traditional African cloth (called boutque), unique handcrafted accessories, and handicrafts to locals and tourists. The outfit you see Tabitha wearing in this picture is one she has made herself from boutque cloth! She has been making a monthly profit of approximately 500 USD from her store that she uses to supplement her husband's income and contribute to the family. Tabitha is requesting a first-time loan of 450 USD to purchase cloth and dyes to customize the traditional clothing that she sells. Tabitha is an exceptionally hard worker who spends eleven hours per day at her store for six days a week. In the future, with increased profits earned as a result of anticipated increased sales of her unique goods, Tabitha hopes to improve the quantity and range of products offered at her store.  \r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":191067,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase raw materials for her clothing business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-17T19:20:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tabitha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-02T05:02:47Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2008-10-02T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:09:57Z","rounded_local_amount":86850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":345764},{"amount":75,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:32:18Z","rounded_local_amount":86850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347905},{"amount":75,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:08Z","rounded_local_amount":86850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970479},{"amount":75,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:09:39Z","rounded_local_amount":86850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886696},{"amount":75,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":86850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435958},{"amount":75,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:01Z","rounded_local_amount":86850,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130262}],"funded_date":"2008-08-19T05:02:47Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":64679,"name":"Zahira's Tusaidiane Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zahira is 24 years old.

They are doing their best in providing a better life for their children, so they will not have to experience what their parents have been through.  Because of the struggles they had, Imelda was motivated to maintain her hog-raising business for them to have an alternative source of income.  At present, she is seeking financial assistance amounting to PHP 3,000 that she will use to buy feed supplies and hopefully expand the business. The financial assistance would be a great opportunity for Imelda to improve their living conditions.

M. is 65 years old and has four children who no longer depend on her.  She sells flowers at her stall in the square in front of the Universal Cemetery of Barranquilla.  She began to work with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo 11 years ago when a consultant observed her and saw her performance.  With the loan of 1,600 Colombian pesos she is asking for, she wants to stock up with artificial and fresh flowers like anthuriums, roses, flower buds, carnations and orchids, which she can get more economically in Maicao, a border city near Venezuela.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda's flower sales business came into being after she abandoned the merchandise sales she had done in Maicao and moved to Barranquilla for security reasons.  She began her business selling flowers with a friend who had the capital, and they got equal profits after the sale.  As this went well for her, she decided to become independent, and during her eleven years with the Fundaci\u00f3n she has had much success with her business.  She says that her greatest challenge is the competition she gets from other people whom Mar\u00eda has taught how to sell flowers.  She used to sit in her tent waiting for people to come look for her, but now she looks for her customers around the cemetery, which has helped her to keep those customers and promote her business; the result is that people come to her, even people from other departments in Colombia whose loved ones are in other cemeteries.  They have a lot of confidence in her since she know how to preserve flowers  Her successes help her to make her dreams come true, and her main dream is to have more capital to supply her business, especially with fresh flowers.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Danielle Maxson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":505390,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Stock artificial and fresh flowers like anthuriums, roses, flower buds, carnations and orchids","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-03-14T04:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":20,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":71187},{"due_date":"2010-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":76641},{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":78110},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79607},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":81133},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82688},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":84273},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85888},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87534},{"due_date":"2011-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":89212},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90922},{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":92664},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94440},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":96250},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":98095},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":99975},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":101892},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":109489}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.82},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.29},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.1},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.93},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.77},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.63},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.4},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.3},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.23},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.17},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.13},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.11},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.11},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.82,"local_amount":71187,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:01Z","rounded_local_amount":72781.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677885},{"amount":40.71,"local_amount":76641,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:58Z","rounded_local_amount":78357.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712266},{"amount":41.5,"local_amount":78110,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":79859.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895766},{"amount":729.97,"local_amount":1374062,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:11:57Z","rounded_local_amount":1404832.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636093}],"funded_date":"2010-03-16T00:05:48Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:11:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":188447,"name":"Naseem's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Naseem, a resident of of the Pakistani city of Borewala, famous for its shrines, is the wife of I., who has operated a vegetable-selling business  for over 25 years.

about five miles away from Magburaka town. This school was established by the Roman Catholics in 1966 to promote education in Sierra Leone. Currently, the school has 10 teachers on its payroll list and 2 unpaid teachers with 285 pupils.  \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan this school is accessing from Kiva through SMT. School staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.\r\n\r\nSixty-two-year-old Augustine M.A. F. (pictured on the right) is the headmaster at the school, and has been a teacher for 43 years.

Ben\u00edtez came from El Carmen de Bol\u00edvar to Barranquilla with her spouse and three children seeking peace and economic stability.  At first they arrived at a relative\u2019s who helped them out.  Later, when her husband got a job as a watchman at a towing site, they moved.  In time, her husband\u2019s boss gave them a room that they gradually enlarged and they started their business of raising animals to sell their meat.  Today, they are in this line of work and they butcher 60 pigs.  Luz Mar\u00eda is in charge of this particular task while her husband works at a saw mill where she secured the business of preparing daily lunches there for 35 employees and daily her business grows.\r\n\r\nThis is the 4th loan with the Foundation and she\u2019s asking for a Kiva loan in the amount of $1.000.000 COP to buy pigs to raise for subsequent pork sales as well as to acquire larger amounts of raw materials and ingredients to prepare the lunches she sells.\r\n\r\nThe loans have made it possible for her to increase profits and buy a car that she uses in the business.  Her dream is focused on buying a house and this is the great challenge she faces: the constant need to save in order to reach it.\r\n\r\nHowever, she  learned how to overcome her challenges since she arrived in Barranquilla with only the wish to get ahead, pushed by the need to provide security and wellbeing for her children who were then little.

After that, she was more confident to borrow and expand this model of rearing pigs. Currently, she is also raising chickens and ducks. Besides raising livestocks, her husband also carries out transportation service so their family's income is stable. Her 2 grown-up children also have stable jobs. This time round, she would like to borrow 10,000,000VND (600USD) to purchase more animal feeds to raise livestocks. She will also purchase more pigs. Her family's monthly income is 4,000,000VND (about 258USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Vinh n\u0103m nay 45 tu\u1ed5i.

from Tanzania! Elizabeti is thirty-six years old and married with three children, two of whom are in school. She has an additional dependent, Benjamin, whom she takes care of because his parents are unable to provide for him. She owns a beauty salon in Dar es Salaam that she runs along with one employee and with the assistance of her children. Hair, hair and more hair! This is the place where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own. Elizabeti earns about 300 USD per month from the salon as a result of working long hours every day of the week. She is requesting a loan of 275 USD to purchase cosmetics, wigs, and other hair products for her salon. In the future, with increased profits gained by serving additional clients, Elizabeti hopes to expand her business.\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.g"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":191084,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional supplies for her beauty salon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-20T00:00:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-03T11:29:28Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-15T07:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":32424,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346857},{"amount":27,"local_amount":29454.55,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:12Z","rounded_local_amount":31266,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347910},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970484},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:11:47Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886701},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:49Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435962},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:23Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130265},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:16Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027096},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:11:53Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613136},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:03Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010219},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":31845,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232534}],"funded_date":"2008-08-20T11:29:28Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":64695,"name":"Nguyen Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"L\u00e0 m\u1ed9t ng\u01b0\u1eddi ph\u1ee5 n\u1eef s\u1ed1ng \u1edf v\u00f9ng n\u00f4ng th\u00f4n \u0111\u00e3 l\u00e2u n\u0103m n\u00ean c\u00f4 K. \u0111\u00e3 c\u00f3 r\u1ea5t nhi\u1ec1u kinh nghi\u1ec7m trong ch\u0103n nu\u00f4i.

She also gets work from various local companies assembling their industrial uniforms; in addition, she installed a perfume sales stand in the market located on the street where she lives, which gives her an additional form of income. \r\n\r\nShe needs a loan of 4,000 MXN that she will pay in 10 installments, given that she is planning on purchasing work materials such as: fabric, buttons, thread, zippers, etc., to assemble the spring costumes that have already been requested by local schools. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":292879,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase work materials such as: fabrics, buttons, threads, zippers, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Villa de Garc\u00eda, N.L.","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2009-03-25T06:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria De Los Angeles ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":4000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":400},{"due_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037366},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:36:36Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927803},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:20:28Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927804},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:20:50Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382872},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:08Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382873},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:19Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889543},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:31Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889544},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:42Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111034},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:49Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111035},{"amount":30,"local_amount":400,"processed_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":427.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73532628}],"funded_date":"2009-03-25T07:27:15Z","paid_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariela Cede\u00f1o","image":883126}},{"id":101573,"name":"Catherine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Tanzania!

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303489,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more grains and then sell them to customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-14T20:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Catherine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:14:46Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613714},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:33Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010793},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233079},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:00Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664870},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:29Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105582},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:27:24Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022698},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867943},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:42Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757144},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:28Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146256},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:54Z","rounded_local_amount":53080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984418}],"funded_date":"2009-04-15T02:46:39Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Waring","image":null}},{"id":105669,"name":"Maria Luz","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria luz es socia del Banco Comunal Reto\u00f1o.\nMaria Luz es casada, tiene 30 a\u00f1os y 3 hijos, vive en el distrito de Acocro, Maria Luz tiene una tienda en su casa en donde vende abarrotes en general, verduras.

She is 59 years old. Agripina is married and has five adult children. To make a living, Agripina operates a business raising livestock. The main source of income for the business comes from raising cows for sale. Agripina is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Agripina joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Agripina has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. Agripina is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase breeding livestock. This will be the sixth loan taken out by Agripina from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Asa grows and sells fruits and vegetables. Asa has been engaged in this business for over 3 years and earns approximately 320 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Asa joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Asa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD. She used her previous loan to buy farm supplies and equipment. Asa is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST to buy farm supplies and equipment. This will be Asa's second loan from SPBD. Asa plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She hopes to make every single member of the group happy by offering each one a part of the loan. \r\n\r\nDilbarkhon B., 49, is a leader of this group. For the past two years, she and her husband have been involved in a cattle reselling business. Most of the work is done by Dilbarkhon, because her husband\u2019s main occupation is construction. Purchasing cattle is not a simple process. Customers usually pay careful attention to the physical appearance of the animal, its health and price. Sometimes Dilbarkhon has to wait several days in order to sell the cattle at a good price. Thanks to her good bargaining skills, she is usually successful. Unfortunately, she doesn\u2019t get help from her children in taking care of the cattle, because all three of them are pursuing a degree in the bigger city of Osh. She is happy with how life has turned out and wishes her children the best. After thorough consideration of the financial possibilities, Dilbarkhon applied for a loan, which she would like to spend on buying more cattle. \r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (being environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

While Nick\u2019s office is in his home, the bikes are built by students at a Detroit high school. The partnering school has a great deal of existing capacity for building, as well as a network for the next generation of cyclists, mechanics, and machinists. Founded in March, this bike project entails designing and manufacturing handmade bicycle trailers. Sales are generated in the neighborhood through open houses, in the city through retail outlets, and nationally through Nick\u2019s website.  In Detroit there is a huge demand for public transportation as it is minimal and unreliable; expanding the capacity of bikes is an opportunity to impact change in the community. \r\n\r\nWith this loan from ACCION USA, Nick will purchase materials for the bikes and advertise the project. Nick hopes to cultivate the positive relationship with the school, allow students to continue working on the project and spread the word about the great need for transportation in Detroit. \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Information About This Loan \r\n\r\nThis loan has been made as a part of Kiva Detroit and in partnership with Michigan Corps.  Kiva Detroit is the first Kiva City, a program where Kiva works with community organizations and field partners in the United States to provide local small businesses with microloans. Michigan Corps is the first community organization to work with Kiva in Detroit, and conducts outreach through small business networks, churches, community foundations, and across many personal and social media networks.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client.

group. They are local entrepreneurs based in Makeni city, located in northern Sierra Leone. To date, these entrepreneurs have received several loans from SMT\/Kiva.

As a result of this, they have been able to provide their children with three meals a day, send them to school and solve most of their daily financial challenges. Having repaid their last loan successfully, they are again requesting a new loan of Le 1,200,000 so that each of them can further improve her businesses. \r\n\r\nFatu J.

She is 63-years old, married with one adult child.  Laura owns and operates a sari-sari or general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of revenue for the business comes from selling everyday use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste etc., in the local community. Laura has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Laura joined Kiva partner GDMPC in order to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Laura has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Laura is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Laura from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n<p>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fishers and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":371935,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is 57 years old. Luz is single. To make a living, Luz owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products like beverages in the local community. Luz has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 3000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Luz joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Luz has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Luz is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Luz from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand the borrower's business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

This city is a fusion of 3 rich cultures in its traditional symbolism and art, the Ca\u00f1ari, Inca and Spanish.  The members of this bank are women who are heads of their households, and who struggle to provide for their families.  They are a happy and supportive group; they are always ready to work together so that they all see their families advance economically.\r\n\r\nLuisa F. is 49 years old and lives in a rented house in the suburb of the city of Cuenca with 3 of her 6 children.  The three oldest of her children are already married and live independently.  Her children who are 16 and 13 years old study at a night school so they can work and help their mother at home, since they have no father.\r\n\r\nLuisa has worked as a cook in the restaurant Pio Pio for 15 years, and her schedule rotates from 8am to 4pm, to 3pm to 11pm.  When one of her co-workers does not show up, she has to double her shift.  In addition to this activity she raises chickens, but only to enjoy at home and not for a business.\r\n\r\nLuisa joined the communal bank \"Alianza Unida\" 5 years ago; she was encouraged by a neighbor who is also a member.  The loans have helped her to get ahead with her children, and to have the habit of saving.  The money from the loan she requests will be invested in the education of her children, paying school fees and buying new uniforms.  If there is any money left she will also buy more chickens. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to buy herself some land so that, little by little, she can start building her own home.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":487079,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"to pay school fees and buy new uniforms for her children, and also to buy chickens","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-02-14T00:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa Amada","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123910753},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:28Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946429},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":68.75,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":68.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128946430},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:39Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674728},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:06Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144708884}],"funded_date":"2010-02-14T05:09:20Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":180087,"name":"Rachele Ann","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rachele Ann M. is from the village of Villa Verde, Balulang, Cagayan De Oro City.
