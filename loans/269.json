She contacted a loan officer who worked in the area in order to find out more about the program Women Entrepreneurs. She was then able to group 17 women who liked to work together.  They are now in their third loan cycle, and work together in a supportive way. \r\n\r\nThe credit for each woman goes toward her respective small business. They all participate in additional activities in order to save as a group, and to mutually help each other achieve their common goals, both individual and as a group. \r\n\r\n1.\tElba S.-\tAccessory and jewelry sales \r\n2.\tAmelia C.-\tFood sales\r\n3.\tLourdes Fern\u00e1ndez-\tAccessory and jewelry sales \r\n4.\tLuciana M.-\tGeneral sales\r\n5.\tRafaela  E.-\tFruit and vegetable sales \r\n6.\tSegunda R.-\tFood sales \r\n7.\tJuliana A.-\tCosmetics sales \r\n8.\tSara R.- \tCosmetics and undergarments sales \r\n9.\tZulma F.-\tFruit sales \r\n10.\tEmilia S.-\tFood sales \r\n11.\tLuisa R.-\tFood sales \r\n12.\tMarta C.-\tFood and candy sales \r\n13.\tBernarda R.-\tFood sales \r\n14.\tMar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez-\tFruit sales \r\n15.\tMichel C.-\tAccessory and jewelry sales \r\n16.\tSebastiana P.-\tCandy, oil and CD sales \r\n17.\tRegina D.

Rosalyn has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 15,000.00 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rosalyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services. She hoped to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Rosalyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000.00 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional fish to sell. Rosalyn is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used as additional capital for her business. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Rosalyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte, and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":516961,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To use as additional capital for her fishing business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tabo-o,Jimenez,Misamis Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":136,"posted_date":"2010-04-15T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:02:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1675.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136683579},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1675.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144717567},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:51:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1675.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151900739},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:18:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1675.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159640753},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1675.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854857},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":1666.65,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1675.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121580}],"funded_date":"2010-04-17T12:29:46Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":197061,"name":"Suzanne","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"N\u00e9e en 1980 \u00e0 Cotonou, capitale \u00e9conomique du B\u00e9nin, B.

Her husband, Bernardo L., who is 50 years old, works as a tricycle driver to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's businesses. They have four children aged between 15 and 26. \r\n<br>Nida joined Kiva partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon, in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past ten loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Nida has been gradually lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 22,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 3,000 PHP, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 11th loan, she is borrowing 29,000 PHP, which she intends to use to purchase feed and other supplies for her piggery. In this way, she hopes to continue to save up for the future and to sustain their daily needs and give their children a good education. \r\n<br>Nida L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \t\r\n<p>\r\n<b>About NWTF<\/b><br>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'honorable').

She lives in her own house with her 32-year old husband Alfredo and their four beloved children for whom she wishes to provide a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nRebeca and her husband have succeeded in making their land fertile and surrounded by lush trees. This is where she grows cocoa and coffee, work she's been doing for ten years. She also gets help from time to time from labourers who work on contract. Ever since she was little, Rebeca learnt about the land from her parents.Her most profitable crop is coffee as she sells it in large quantities and for a good price. With the money she earns, she has managed to buy many useful items for the home. \r\n\r\nThe season she likes the least is winter because of the number of insects and the large amount of rain. This is why she has approached the institution Financiera for a loan to try to overcome the insect infestations and safeguard the blossoms on the crops. \r\n\r\nRebeca's plan for the future is to continue farming and acquire more land so that she can overcome the poverty in which her family lives. She does not want to cause any problems for the financial institution or for the members of her community bank. She is grateful to the donors for their help with her work.

She lives with her spouse and three children who are 7, 5 and 2 years old in their own house.  Nadia\u2019s work consists in selling food.  She goes to the market very early to buy the ingredients to prepare the food because in the afternoon she goes out into the street in front of her house to start selling her delicious and well prepared Juanes [made with rice, pieces of poultry meat, eggs, olives, aromatic herbs and spices, all wrapped up in \"bijao\" (plant from the jungle) leaves and boiled in clay pots], Tacachos [hash-like dish of plantain and pork or chicken] and roasted pork and chicken.  She\u2019s been in this business for two years and works alone since her children are still too young and her spouse returns late from work.  What she likes about her work is that it leaves her with time to tend to her household, that is, she can care for her children since they are at a stage where they need much attention.  She is doing well in her work because she sells quite a bit every day and she hopes to stay in business and gradually equip it.\r\n\r\nThis will be her first MFP loan.

Samuel","description":{"languages":["pt"],"texts":{"pt":"Sabado is 39 years old and she is from the province of Gaza. Sabado has 7 children with two different wives -- 5 of them are from the same mother and their ages range from 8 to 18 years old. His children from the second wife are 13 and 16 years old. Out of the 7 children, only the oldest one does not go to school anymore. Besides his children, Sabado also supports his mother who lives in Chokwe by sending her a monthly allowance. \r\nSabado went to school until the 4th grade and he says he did not continue his education because he traveled during his vacation to another province and once he returned his spot in the school was not available any longer. In 1980, right after his father death, he moved away from the province of Gaza and relocated to Maputo to look for a better life. In 1981 he worked for Vetagro-Boane and between 1995 and 1997 he worked as a security guard when there were many lay-offs and he was also let go. In 1998 he tried following his friend's steps by opening up a chicken raising business but he had to abandon that activity due to a lethal epidemic that killed many of his hens. Sabado lives in his own home.\r\nSabado learned the trade by watching his friends do it since 1998. He has a permanent location on Namaacha Avenue in the town of Mazanbanine and its normal hours of operation are from 7:00am to 9:00pm -- these hours can be longer if there is a great influx of business. He has been engaged in this field for 6 years and with help from two employees he has been able to sell beer for 25,00mt, juices for 10,00mt and semea for 120,00 per bag. Sabado's income varies between 300,00mt and 1000,00mt per month and, depending on the business volume, it could reach as much as 2500,00mt. It is a goal to Sabado to expand and keep his business growing. \r\nHis plans for the near future are open up more establishments in the town where he lives and expand his business.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer<\/p> \r\n\r\nSabado tem 39 anos de idade e \u00e9 natural da prov\u00edncia de gaza. Sabado \u00e9 pai de 7 filhos com duas esposas sendo 5 filhos de uma mesma pessoa, com idades variando entre 18 e 8 anos de idade. Com a outra esposa Sabado tem dois filhos de 16 e 13 anos. Dos 7 filhos o mais velho j\u00e1 n\u00e3o vai a escola e os outros estudam. Para alem dos filhos Sabado sustenta a sua m\u00e3e que se encontra em Chokwe enviando valores monet\u00e1rios para ela.\r\n\r\nSabado estudou ate 4\u00aaclasse e diz que n\u00e3o continuou por ter perdido a vaga quando nas ferias do fim do ano viajou para outra prov\u00edncia e quando voltou j\u00e1 n\u00e3o havia vaga. Em 1980 mudou-se da prov\u00edncia de Gaza para Maputo a procura de melhores condi\u00e7\u00f5es de vida, logo apos a morte do seu pai. Em 1981 trabalhou no Vetagro-Boane, em 1995 trabalhou como seguran\u00e7a at\u00e9 1997, ano que demitiram trabalhadores e ele foi atingido. Em 1998 tentou seguir os amigos abrindo um negocio de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de  frangos que s\u00f3 veio deixar o mesmo em 2002 quando teve a quebra de morte dos pintos. Sabado vive na casa pr\u00f3pria.\r\n\r\nSabado aprendeu o negocio copiando aos amigos desde 1998. Tem um estabelecimento permanente sita na AV. Da Namaacha no bairro Mazanbanine. Exercendo atividades comerciais ha 6 anos, o estabelecimento funciona das 7:00h at\u00e9 21:00h excluindo os dias de muito movimento. Sabado tem dois empregados e tem vendido mais cerveja por 25,00mt, refresco por 10,00mt e semea por 120,00mt o saco. Sabado tem um rendimento entre 300,00mt e 1000,00mt por m\u00eas dependendo do movimento, pode ate fazer 2500,00mt por m\u00eas. Assim constitui como desafio para Sabado expandir ou manter o seu negocio.\r\n\r\nPara Sabado \u00e9 o segundo empr\u00e9stimo na Hluvuku e primeiro no Kiva e nunca teve empr\u00e9stimo em outras institui\u00e7\u00f5es. O primeiro foi de 15000,00mt com qual comprou mercadoria aumentando o seu stock. Assim com este empr\u00e9stimo Sabado quer comprar novamente mercadoria para de novo aumentar o stock e assim espera melhorar o seu negocio.\r\n\r\nO plano com o negocio daqui em diante \u00e9 abrir mais estabelecimento no bairro onde ele reside bairro 07 e futuramente ampliar os neg\u00f3cios."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":171694,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase merchandise to increase stock.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MZ","country":"Mozambique","town":"Boane, Maputo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-26.041667 32.325278","type":"point"}},"partner_id":23,"posted_date":"2008-06-19T22:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabado Samuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-12T13:54:42Z","disbursal_currency":"MZN","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2008-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.22},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2222.24}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":94.44},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":94.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95,"local_amount":2235.29,"processed_date":"2008-07-30T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T05:14:25Z","rounded_local_amount":2265.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":281242},{"amount":95,"local_amount":2235.29,"processed_date":"2008-08-30T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:06:32Z","rounded_local_amount":2265.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":311077},{"amount":95,"local_amount":2235.29,"processed_date":"2008-09-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-01T07:22:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2265.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":342182},{"amount":92.78,"local_amount":2183.01,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T05:54:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2212.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5322621},{"amount":94.44,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T23:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9941808},{"amount":94.44,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-20T09:02:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14865418},{"amount":94.44,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-03T08:20:53Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20407663},{"amount":94.44,"local_amount":2222.22,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-22T08:06:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27100574},{"amount":94.46,"local_amount":2222.24,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-20T08:28:04Z","rounded_local_amount":2252.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35994771}],"funded_date":"2008-06-28T13:54:42Z","paid_date":"2009-05-20T08:28:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":56918,"name":"Rima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rima, 47 years old, is single and lives in a small village in the South of Lebanon.

He has been able to improve his business with the organizations that have funded him. Dom Demetrio\u2019s goals are to continue in this small business, as it is his major source of income. This loan is necessary for working capital to be put to good use in the purchase of products such as basic grains, chicken, meat, cheese and sodas. His goal is to obtain a clothing store, because he would like to learn another type of business. The loan is for C$6,000 c\u00f3rdobas ($300 USD).<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Towle, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":284103,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-03-12T21:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Demetrio Calixtro","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":30.26,"local_amount":605.26,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:37:39Z","rounded_local_amount":609.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092133},{"amount":29.73,"local_amount":594.74,"processed_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":599.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985515},{"amount":30,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:09:41Z","rounded_local_amount":604.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446134},{"amount":30,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:39:43Z","rounded_local_amount":604.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956768},{"amount":180.01,"local_amount":3600,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:46Z","rounded_local_amount":3627.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174192}],"funded_date":"2009-03-13T14:39:01Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca Towle","image":225476}},{"id":97897,"name":"Jamuna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Jamuna is a shopkeeper in the town of Chetrapati, Kathmandu.

For 20 years he has worked in the agriculture business. Today he grows rice (20 hectares), but when this product is consistent and growing he also works raising cattle. Now he has 80 animals which he feeds appropriately so that they gain weight and their size becomes attractive to customers. Glicerio is helped by his children and his wife who take advantage of the space on the land to plant products for their daily consumption. What Glicerio likes about this work is that it keeps him active and he can teach his children what he has learned. Also, it is very profitable business as he already has a stable rice buyer and always makes a net profit when selling cattle.\r\n<p>\r\nGlicerio has already gotten 11 loans with MFP. He likes the communal bank because his fellow members are very trustworthy and responsible. With the money from the loan he is asking for, Glicerio would buy about 100 soles worth of rice to plant, and with the rest and his savings would acquire a bull from good stock.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kevin Credo, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":403131,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of seeds and a bull","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-10-10T05:10:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Glicerio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:28Z","rounded_local_amount":502.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842995},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":502.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734571}],"funded_date":"2009-10-17T10:36:24Z","paid_date":"2010-01-25T09:54:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kevin Credo","image":null}},{"id":147156,"name":"Mirna","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mirna Ordo\u00f1ez B. es una se\u00f1ora de 39 a\u00f1os de edad quien vive con dos de sus cuatro hijos.

She is married and has 4 children.  She lives in Hilata and finished elementary school.  She has been associated with the Manuela Ramos Movement for 6 years.  Her initial, 300 new sol, loan was used to buy small farm animals.  Currently, she needs a 700 new sol loan to buy sheep which she will later sell at retail (meat by the kilogram) in the local markets once a week.  Her greatest wish is to continue working so that she can afford her children's education.  She likes the savings and the way the loans are administered.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva

She lives with her spouse and their children in Hamdallaye, one of the quarters of Sikasso. Mrs. Ramatou O. has bought and sold food condiments for 30 years, following her mom's work since she was very young. \r\nWith the intention of better satisfying her ever-growing clientele, she decided to collaborate with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso about seven years ago. She received several group loans with an association of women in Kadiolo Moumousso and is now on her fourth individual loan. All of her previous loans have been repaid in full.\r\nWith this loan, she plans on buying 12 cartons of tomato concentrate, six cartons of seasoning, three bags of pepper grains, three bags of dried onions, two bags of Lori\u00e9 leaves, five cartons of mustard, and other condiments at the large market in Sikasso. She sells her products at wholesale and retail. Sales are done cash and credit to customers and retail distributors at the new M\u00e9dine market where she does her business. \r\nWith this loan, she foresees making a monthly profit of 120,000 FCFA which she will use to contribute to her family's needs, pay the interest on the loan, and invest the rest in her business. She plans on someday becoming a wholesale distributor at the new market where she works in order to serve the retail distributors there who often have difficulty getting supplies.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Kelly Percival, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":541196,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of condiments","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":187.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:31Z","rounded_local_amount":100230.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913576},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:26Z","rounded_local_amount":100230.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613409},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:43Z","rounded_local_amount":100230.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606120},{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":100230.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226088}],"funded_date":"2010-06-03T17:38:16Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:47:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kelly Percival","image":null}},{"id":205271,"name":"Sokleang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sokleang T.

She is 45 years old. Jovita is married. To make a living, Jovita owns & operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. She also sells some livestock feed. Jovita has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Jovita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jovita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Jovita is requesting a new loan of 13,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the 6th loan taken out by Jovita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: a general store, an electronic reloading business and a frozen products business. Her husband Richard D., who is 41 years old, works as a painter in Dubai. They have three children between 10 and 20 years old. \r\n\r\nElvira joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elvira has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 20,000 PHP, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her fourth cycle loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP to use as working capital to continue to save for the future.  Elvira D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through its alleviation program, NWTF is empowering women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass their dreams. They have chosen a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She says that this business is profitable and the major challenge she has is lack of a permanent place to run her business, making it difficult to work for long hours as well as retain customers. However, she works very hard to keep her business doing well. She is using her loan of Kes 60,000 to buy more clothes to grow her business and meet the demand of her customers. She hopes that in future, she will be importing clothes, shoes and bags. She describes herself as tolerant and responsible."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":743179,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

She is happily married and, together with her handsome husband, is blessed with eight adorable children. Despite her considerable age for the past 30 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, and because of the immense knowledge she has on farming, farmers come to seek advice from her. Margaret is the breadwinner of her family, and this really pushes her to work hard so that her children will have a bright future and her parents will have a comfortable life.\n\nAlthough she makes a profit from farming, she is not comfortable and has always wanted to increase her income by selling cereals. That is why she is seeking this loan to buy cereals. Kenya's Kitale area, one of the country's populated regions, has a high demand for cereals. This means that Margaret could increase her profits and satisfy the demand that is there. \n\nAccessing funds has been a challenge for Margaret, but she now feels relieved, because Juhudi Kilimo is partnering with Kiva lenders to help aspiring women farmers like her turn their farming dreams into reality through training and loan financing. Margaret believes that this loan will be of much help, and that she will be able to satisfy the demand for cereals. She also believes that the extra income she earns will enable permanent change in her life and increase her business. Increased profits will allow Margaret to repay this loan and secure the future of her school-going children.She dreams of building a modern house and moving from the mud house where she currently stays in.\n"}},"status":"inactive","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":2049322,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To buy cereals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kitale","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1.016667 35","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margaret","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2830.92},{"due_date":"2016-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2913.65},{"due_date":"2016-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2998.8},{"due_date":"2016-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3086.44},{"due_date":"2016-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3176.65},{"due_date":"2016-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3269.48},{"due_date":"2016-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3365.03},{"due_date":"2016-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3463.38},{"due_date":"2016-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3564.59},{"due_date":"2016-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3668.77},{"due_date":"2016-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3775.99},{"due_date":"2016-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":3886.3}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.31},{"due_date":"2016-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.14},{"due_date":"2016-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.99},{"due_date":"2016-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.86},{"due_date":"2016-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.77},{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.69},{"due_date":"2016-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.65},{"due_date":"2016-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.63},{"due_date":"2016-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.65},{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2017-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.76},{"due_date":"2017-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.86}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":3681,"name":"Hou\u00e9gnam\u00e9tor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Born on August 7, 1965 in Lom\u00e9, Ms. Hou\u00e9gnam\u00e9tor A. is a married mother of two children and also takes care of one other child.

Fue as\u00ed que empez\u00f3 primero como vendedora y actualmente es coordinadora de un grupo de vendedoras y est\u00e1 trabajando muy fuerte para llegar a ser directora esperando lograrlo. <\/p>\r\n<p>Sin embargo el camino es dif\u00edcil y se requiere de mucho esfuerzo, es por esto que est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito de US $575 que est\u00e1 dispuesta a pagarlos en un plazo de 5 meses, para poder comprar los pedidos que le hicieron en esta temporada, y as\u00ed poder cumplir con la meta que se traz\u00f3.

She sells children\u2019s clothes.  She is a very good sales person; she can always convince her customers to buy an article of clothing.  Carmen really enjoys talking with her neighboring vendors; it makes the long work day seem less tiring.  She has been doing this for 10 years.  What she likes least about her work is having to stay in her stand all day without being able to leave.  \r\n\r\nShe yearns to have a larger clothing store where she could sell her clothes more calmly.  This is her first loan with MFP.  She knows that she has to repay on time so that the she does not cause problems for the members of her community bank.

J. was born in Quelimane 47 years ago. He studied until 5th grade and in his free time helped his parents in house chores, and also helped raised his two younger brothers while his parents were at work. Back then, 5th grade was the highest level of education in Mozambique and Olimpio had to go to Cuba to continue his studies, thanks to a scholarship he received. He studied until 10th grade and from there was drafted into the army and did his training from 1982 to 1985.\r\n\r\nHe came back to Mozambique in 1985 and still works as a Marine in the Marinha de Guerra de Mozambique. He's been working for the army for the past 28 years from 7:30AM to 3:30PM and makes around U$385 per month, which he uses to support his family and save. He's was married in 1992 and had two children, a 16 and a 14 year old. His first wife passed away and he later remarried, and had two more children, a 7 and a 5 year old. All his children are going to school.\r\n\r\nOlimpio heard of Hluvuku from friends and has already taken 5 loans, this one being his 6th. He wants to finish building his house and also build a small business nearby, where he'll sell a little bit of everything, from food products to building supplies. He thinks he has chances to succeed because right now everyone has to go to the neighbor city of Maputo to get basic things, and starting his business will be like a dream coming true.<br

Her previous loan of 8,000 PHP helped her earn a profit of 32,000 PHP, raising her family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing 10,000 PHP, which she intends to use as additional capital so that she can continue to save up for the future, to improve her business and pay for her daughter's education. Charisse D. C. is a 'Dungganon' woman who is following an honorable path toward achieving her dreams. \n\n About NWTF\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them 'Dungganon' \u2013 a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of the community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work. \n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":565814,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Phone Accessories","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"As additonal working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dalaguete, Cebu","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2010-07-15T13:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Charisse","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":4,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":769.2},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":769.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.3},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.3},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.3},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.31},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.3},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":72,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:40:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3339.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159677630},{"amount":153,"local_amount":6800,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7096.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166891221}],"funded_date":"2010-07-15T13:59:42Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:41:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":217577,"name":"Dominic Ole","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dominic Ole Y. is 28 years old.

Modesto is a dedicated farmer. He plans to focus his efforts on the planting and harvest of cayenne and habanero peppers. He works in cooperation with his family to strike a balance between accomplishing the daily tasks associated with agricultural production and the completion of domestic responsibilities. The land he works is his own. In addition to his agricultural activity, Modesto feels it is important to be an active member of his community. As a result, he dedicates a significant portion of his time to community meetings, groups and events. The rural zone where Modesto and his family live is sparsely populated with infrequent bus service and a general lack of infrastructure. Modesto is working hard towards the sustenance of his family, striving to reap the maximum benefits from his land and his labour. \r\n\r\nAlthough this is an individual loan, the community in which Modesto and his family live is very close-knit and interdependent. Neighbours help and support one another by sharing experiences and expertise acquired over the years. All individual members of the Upala community are dedicated to the improvement of living conditions for the region as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis loan will be used to finance the production of cayenne and habanero peppers. Specifically, the loan will be used to finance the purchase of a variety of necessary agricultural nutrients, fertilizers and chemicals in order to ensure a healthy harvest. All labour and logistical tasks associated with production will be carried out by Modesto with the help of his family members in the region of Upala. The productive cycle (from planting to harvest) for these types of peppers is roughly one year. Modesto planted his peppers 4 months ago and will expect to harvest in the next 8 months. Typically, he dedicates the hours from 7:00 AM to 4:30 PM everyday to his agricultural activities. \r\n\r\nPiper and Capiscum Processors Compa\u00f1\u00eda Agr\u00edcola Industrial, or PROPICA, is an international buyer and seller of chili pepper and ground pepper products. In cooperation with Fundaci\u00f3n Mujer, PROPICA has guaranteed to purchase the agricultural products (the peppers) that are to be produced with the help of this loan. PROPICA acts as a guaranteed client for small agricultural producers in the area of Upala, thus ensuring that their products will reach market. \r\n\r\nThe main obstacle Modesto and other producers in the Upala community face is a lack of access to working capital funds.

He and his family reside in the neighborhood of Casa Blanca in the Department of Francisco Morazan.  \r\n<p>\r\nJose sells snacks and soft drinks.  He started this business because there was no other place in town where one could buy soft drinks and snacks without having to walk a long distance.  Jose talked with his wife about his idea of opening a small snack stand and she agreed.  Little by little, he restocked his business with other products.  His schedule of operation is from 5pm to 11pm.  When Jose gets home after completing his work day, he starts helping out at the snack stand as a waiter.  His wife takes care of the cooking while he attends to the customers.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe loan Jose is requesting will be used to buy soft drinks, vegetables, meats, flour, oil, miniature greens, sauces, condiments, and other products such as cookies, donuts, and candy.  With the support of this loan, his business will be well-stocked and his sales will increase.

Since he was very small he has worked in agricultural activities.  His parents left him their lands in an inheritance, as well as their knowledge of such things.  Today he is a responsible father that assumes his role as the provider for his family.  He is the boss of his home but he is not authoritarian.  His leadership abilities help him to be able to organize any type of committee to benefit his community.  Victor has worked in agriculture for around twenty years.  Recently the harvests were jeopardized by inclement weather but even with that he continued persevering with the sowing of potato, beans and oats.  He is motivated by his wife and 4 children.  He seeks to intensify his activities in raising animals so that they can become another way of maintaining his home.  To do this he will buy a cow to fatten it up and sell it later.  All his efforts are so that his children can have an education.  He has a desire to see them succeed.

They are grateful to Elsa and her husband due to the efforts they made for sustenance and education.  Elsa began her business when a very difficult situation forced her to leave her fixed job.  \r\n\r\nFrom a very young age, Elsa was a primary school teacher, but using the chalk disagreed with her throat, and the chalk and the effort that she made for her students caused nodes of inflammation.  This was the reason why her bosses decided to lay her off, but Elsa was not vanquished and with her small severance she started a small grocery store.  This is what has been a source of income for her and her family since them.  Because her husband was an electrical technician and works without a fixed location, they don\u2019t earn much.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Judith has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Judith joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Judith is requesting a new loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Judith from GDMPC.

All of them live in the city of Cuenca, the third biggest city in Ecuador, declared Cultural Patrimony of Humanity due to its natural beauty, and unique architecture of its historical center.\r\n\r\nDiana L. has been a member of El Ahorro for 8 seasons. During that time, she has taken advantage of the loans she received, investing in her business, her home and covering her 4-year-old daughter\u2019s pre-school expenses. Diana is 24 years old. She's the only income of the house, as the father is not involved in their lives.\r\n\r\nDiana is a sales person. She sells toys, plastic-based items and others. She started helping her mother when she was 5 and by the time she was 14, she was handling her own products and had her own clients. She has a stand in the '9 de Octubre' local market, always having problems with police, who's constantly picking her up because she doesn\u2019t own her stand. She doesn\u2019t own a home, either and she\u2019s still renting a home with her daughter.\r\n\r\nThis new loan will be used to purchase dolls, soccer balls, tea sets, lights and more plastic-based toys to sell during the Christmas season. \r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to have her own stand to work more comfortably and to build her own home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jimena

They both live with their two children, Herman (age 27) and Luis (age 26), in their own home which they inherited from her in-laws.  \r\n<p>\r\nWhen she began making pastries, Edis used her earnings to meet the family\u2019s expenses, pay for the food they consumed on a daily basis, and cover her children\u2019s education.  For this reason, she took great care in performing her work.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor the past three years, Edis has been making empanadas (pastries filled with meat) and selling them to different soda fountains and restaurants.  She also decorates cakes and desserts for ceremonies and special events.  What she enjoys most about her job is preparing her empanadas and selling them with great joy.  She believes she generates more sales when she has a smile on her face.  On the other hand, the thing she hates most is having to chop onions.  Laughingly she says, \u201cit is part of the job, but I would rather not do it.\u201d  Edis always looks to progress in her business, so she plans to open a food stand so that she can sell her products without having to walk great distances.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her third loan with MFP.  Edis knows the lending methodology very well and enjoys sharing her experiences with the other members of the Communal Bank.  With her loan of 1000 soles, she plans to buy all the ingredients and supplies needed to prepare pastries and snacks in larger quantities. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica,

Thelma has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Thelma joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a new loan of 50,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and working capital. This  will be the eighth loan she has taken out from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the central and north-eastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

For the past 4 years she has been making and selling \u201csalchipapas\u201d (a typical dish made  of potatoes and pieces of fried chicken) every day in the doorway of her house.  She has some regular customers who like the taste of her food, and also buy from her often since her prices are reasonable.  What she likes most about her job is the peace of mind it gives her because she can keep up with her housework.  Her biggest worry about her business is maintaining good hygiene,  and  the good will of her customers because it generates a better income.  In the first few days of the week she doesn't finish selling all that she has prepared, but on the weekends her sales turn around and she has higher earnings.  In the future she would like to expand her business, and to succeed, she will continue running it herself as she always has.  This is her first loan with MFP, and she knows that the loan will be very helpful to increase her working capital.  For this reason she promises to make all her repayments on time.

She does not even have a high school background, but that does not imply that her dream is not big. She is married to Jerlito, a vendor, and together they are raising four children in their home in Binondo, Manila.\r\n\r\nLetecia runs her own sari-sari (variety) store, along with a water refilling station and the daily operation of a passenger motorcycle. All three are profitable and altogether yield earnings of about PHP 11,000 per month. Letecia focuses her attention on her variety store, which is situated at their home. Having been in business for around five years now, Letecia already knows the needs of her community and responds to them by filling her store with essential food items and other products. \r\n\r\nTo further help her grow her business, Letecia has applied for a PHP 12,000 loan. She intends to use this loan to add more products to the array of items in her store to cater to the changing needs of her customers. Also, part of the money will be invested in her water refilling station. \r\n\r\nLetecia admits that competition in the area gives her a headache, but she is determined not to lose hope but to remain strong and overcome the challenge. She looks forward to earning more than enough in order to be able to have her own commercial space. She dreams of having her own house and lot,  where she can enjoy the evening rest with her family. One simple dream, but never a small dream.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, she is faithfully attending weekly fellowship* meetings where she can draw strength and inspiration as a mother, a wife, and as a micro entrepreneur.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":696863,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She lives in Ilog, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 1998 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her Nipa business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,000. Brenda is borrowing PHP 19,500 to stock up on Nipa to resell as this is usually the time people repair their roofs before the rainy season. This will be her 19th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Brenda aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This is a small rural community of around 2,000 inhabitants.  The local people work in milk production and farming.  The area has an uneven terrain and much of the land remains a humid, tropical forest.  Cimarr\u00f3n is located approximately one and a half hour's bus ride away from Turrialba, the nearest trade center.  However, sometimes during the year the road becomes impassable due to rain.  \r\n\r\nFor several years, Grettel has wanted to improve her dairy.  She has the premises she needs to carry out her business but she lacks the capital needed for her business to do well.  Her goal is to sell her products to the neighbors in her community.  This project is of great interest to her.\r\n\r\nGrettel is requesting a micro loan for 500,000 colones to buy a cow.  She hopes that this will help her to grow her business and improve both her own quality of life as well as that of her family.\r\n\r\nGrettel is a member of the 'Nuevas Esperanzas para Cimarr\u00f3n' (New Hope for Cimarr\u00f3n) Community Loan Company, one of 110 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This will be her first loan and, with it, she hopes to continue growing both on a personal and financial level.  She will also take an active part in her community's loan

For fifteen years he has lived with his partner and the mother of his five children in their own house. For 22 years he has been growing bananas and citrus fruit, but what he prefers to grow is coffee, as it is more profitable, even though it takes 2 to 3 years to mature and requires a lot of effort to ensure that it grows uniformly, in order to start harvesting it. Every time his coffee crop is ready to be harvested he is very happy because this is the time to earn money, which covers food and clothing expenses for all his children.\r\n\r\nJesus also works on other farms as a day laborer, and many of his neighbors prefer to give him work because he is very efficient, leaving the fields very clean. For this reason they pay him between 15 and 17 soles a day. This is very valuable to him at the times when he has nothing to harvest. Through his work, Jesus hopes to acquire additional arable land in order to improve his quality of life.\r\n\r\nThis is his fifth loan from MFP. During the four previous cycles he has made his payments on time. He does not have a position in his communal bank, but sometimes he is responsible for passing messages from the lender on to the other members. The money he is requesting will be used to purchase 10 bags of fertilizer for his coffee plants.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kristen Beck, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":343448,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-26T19:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jes\u00fas","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":400}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:45Z","rounded_local_amount":203,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123977},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":1015,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992354}],"funded_date":"2009-06-26T20:11:39Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kristen Jancuk","image":703031}},{"id":122521,"name":"Abdullojon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"T.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a hard worker and lives with her children, 11 year old Fernando and 12 year old Alexander. Six years ago she started manufacturing clothing in work space located in her home. She lives alone with her children, who take up a lot of her time since they are school age and need a lot of support and advice. They are the reason why she works at home as she felt this was best. However, it is not easy to work at home as she needs to dedicate a lot of time to make the clothing her customers order. Since she has a large volume of orders there are times when she cannot fulfill them and has to ask for help. In\u00e9s has been able to overcome these challenges because she realizes that through her hard work and dedication she will eventually have a larger manufacturing shop and will therefore be able to build a brighter future for her family. This is her fourth loan from MFP. She is very responsible with her payments and makes them on time, just as she did when she participated in group loans. She has asked for an individual loan this time. The money will go toward buying material in larger quantities, in addition to other items. This will allow her to make more clothing and fulfill the most recent orders from her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Montserrat Zuckerman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":383299,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy clothing material","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-09-04T22:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ines","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":194.22},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":215.86},{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":227.61},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":234.19},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":243.88},{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":259.59},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":264.7},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":276.81},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":287.09},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":296.05}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.98},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.97},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.36},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.85},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.65},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":96.88},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.48},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":67.98,"local_amount":194.22,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:27Z","rounded_local_amount":199.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997454},{"amount":75.55,"local_amount":215.86,"processed_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:29Z","rounded_local_amount":222.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842799},{"amount":223.19,"local_amount":637.69,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:06:34Z","rounded_local_amount":656.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734376},{"amount":23.8,"local_amount":67.99,"processed_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:44Z","rounded_local_amount":69.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959601},{"amount":90.85,"local_amount":259.59,"processed_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:33Z","rounded_local_amount":267.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992397},{"amount":92.65,"local_amount":264.7,"processed_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":272.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717240},{"amount":96.88,"local_amount":276.81,"processed_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":284.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751017},{"amount":100.48,"local_amount":287.09,"processed_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:28Z","rounded_local_amount":295.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933655},{"amount":103.62,"local_amount":296.05,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":304.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672591}],"funded_date":"2009-09-05T14:40:25Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":138958,"name":"So","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"S\u1edf Th\u1ecb \u0110\u1ed7 was born in 1964.

She lives in the community of Coraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas in El Valle Parrish.  She is 56 years old and has been widowed for 15 years as a result of her husband\u2019s alcoholism.  Her five children range in age from 12 to 35.  The four oldest children are married and have their own families.  The youngest child is a student at Benigno Malo High School, but he does not live at home.  Instead, he stays at the home of her nephew.  \r\n<p>\r\nLuz told us that she previously worked preparing stucco but she started developing spinal problems.  This forced her to spend her time doing housework and raising chickens and guinea pigs.  Some of the animals are reserved for personal consumption, but most of them are sold to neighbors in the community or at the local markets.  \r\n<p>\r\nLuz has been working with the Institution for two years and used her previous loans to buy chickens and guinea pigs for breeding.  With this new loan from Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR, she will buy feed and vitamins for her animals.  A portion of the loan will be used to pay for some household expenses.

To make a living, Ronaldo owns and operates a business venture in the services sector providing transportation services. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing motorcycle transport services. Ronaldo has been engaged in his business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Ronaldo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and his ability to engage in business activities. As with his previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI which was successfully repaid, the new loan of 3,000 PHP will be used to repair his existing vehicle to improve the service. This will be the seventh loan he has taken out from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay his children's tuition fees. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

Now grocery sales are very good and he is well known in his town because of the good service that he gives his customers.\r\n\r\nHe usually works in the fields on his own, but hires field hands at harvest time and he sells his coffee in the distribution centers in his area.

The two eldest are attending school and it is very expensive. Her husband is a driver and his income is often not enough to cover the family's expenses. \r\n\r\nFor this reason she decided to sell clothing from door to door. On Saturdays and Sundays she also sells foods from a small restaurant in her home. She says that her situation is very difficult but with their hard work and effort they have managed to pull through. She sells her clothing items on credit, collecting weekly payments. She travels to Guayaquil one a month to purchase merchandise. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be invested in the purchase of merchandise and four plastic chairs for her restaurant business. She has been a member of this community bank since the beginning and she enjoys it because she has seen an improvement in her sales.

She will use her earnings to continue investing in her business in order to improve her sales.  She will include more products and new clothes.  That way she will be able to make her business grow.  She will achieve her dream of being able to finish building her house.  She also wishes to have good health and a life that is more economically stable.\r\n\r\nShe started her association with Esperanza because the payments are much more flexible and the interest is less.

She makes leather and woven handicrafts and has been in this business for 10 years.  She makes clothes, accessories and soft furnishings.  Her models are exclusives as she also designs them.\r\n\r\nIsabel's workshop is located in her home and all her products are made to order.  She has a web page where she promotes and publicizes her handicrafts.  Her customers are mainly professionals who don't have a lot of time available to go to the stores and buy products.  For this reason, her system for promoting her products is aimed at them.  Isabel uses a Notebook to exhibit her merchandise and send catalogs on line.  She works alone in her business.\r\n\r\nIsabel buys some of her merchandise in a leather store and other supplies from a wholesaler.  She will use this loan to buy materials for making her handicrafts.  She will also send her two sewing machines to be repaired.  Her goal is to buy industrial sewing machines and an iPad so that she can better sell her products.\r\n\r\nIsabel lives together with her husband who helps her to move the machinery in her workshop.  Her motivation for continuing in her business is that she enjoys it and finds it therapeutic since she used to suffer from depression some years ago.  She is continuing to look after herself but her mood is favorable.\r\n\r\nIsabel is very happy and grateful for the loan that she has obtained from Fondo Esperanza since it means she will be able to invest in her business.  The meetings that she attends are very pleasant and she is also participating in some sales workshops which is making her very happy.\r\n\r\nTemuco is the capital of Araucania region.

One is in her house, which was built with great effort, and the other is in the house of her sister, who lives in Spain and gave it to her to look after.  Her mother-in-law runs one of the stores while she takes care of the other.  She tells us that her children help her when they aren't busy and on weekends.   She's had about 10 years with her business and thanks to her efforts was able to build her home and improve her life.\r\n\r\nThis loan is to stock up her stores even more; she is going to buy general food supplies as she likes to have everything that her customers prefer.

With an initial capital of Rp1,600,000 (about US$176) Wayan Kolih bought 2 mother pigs. Every day Wayan Kolih has to spend Rp20,000 (about $2.20) for pig feed, since she fed them twice a day. Every 4 months her 2 mother pigs would bore piglets, that were ready to be sold 1.5 to 2 months after birth. Each pig could bore 6-10 piglets. From piglets sales Wayan Kolih could profit Rp1,500,000 (about $165)\/6-months. This profit is used for school expenses of her 2 children who still sit in Middle school, since her husband's income aa a tenant farmer is not sure, and not enough to support a family. This profit is also used to repair her semi permanent home.

Setiap 4bulan sekali kedua induk babi ini akan melahirkan anaknya dan akan siap dijual setelah berumur 1,5 sampai 2 bulan sejak lahir.Satu ekor babi biasanya mempunyai anak 6 sampai 10 ekor.Dari penjualan anak-anak babi ini biasanya Wayan Kolih mendapat keuntungan Rp.1.500.000 setiap 6 bulan sekali.Keuntungan ini dipergunakan untuk biaya sekolah  kedua anaknya yang kini duduk dibangku SMU, karena penghasilan suaminya sebagai seorang petani tidak tentu sehingga tidak bisa mencukupi kebutuhan keluarga,keuntungan ini juga sedikit demi sedikit dipergunakan untuk memperbaiki rumahnya yang kini masih semi permanen.Sedangkan pinjaman yang diperoleh dari DINARI dipergunakan untuk membeli bibit babi yang lebih bagus dan berkwalitas karena akan dipelihara sebagai penggemukan ,agar hasil yang didapat  lebih baik."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":71492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy pig feedstock<p>Membeli bibit babi","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-04T03:15:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Wayan Kolih","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-18T05:18:15Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":150,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-10-22T01:55:15Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":70368},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T02:46:11Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86640},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-21T01:52:10Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":100296},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T07:26:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119100},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T00:57:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":139687},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:56Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-24T10:25:10Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":164707}],"funded_date":"2007-10-04T05:18:15Z","paid_date":"2008-03-24T04:45:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":24210,"name":"Rosemary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\"I learned the act of trade from my mother.

During the summer, the central water supply dries up, so Juma built a water reservoir at home to have a reliable source of water at all times. Juma will use this loan to purchase several cows.

Sharif has worked as a farmer for the past 10 years. However, life has been difficult and progress slow. Because he lacks financial resources, Sharif would like to borrow 2500 Somoni so that he can buy seeds and fertilizer for his crop.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives in his own house with his family. His biggest wish is to improve his quality of life. He is dedicated to a bakery and his work schedule starts very early. Approximately at 4:30 a.m. he is already awake and ready to prepare the bread that his whole neighborhood enjoys. \r\n<p>\r\nHe is not the owner of the oven that he uses, but he is very responsible and the oven\u2019s owner trusts him a lot. \r\nWhat he likes the most in his work is to make the bread and he does it neatly. He has been working with bread making for 5 years and what he considers to be the most difficult part of it is to have to get up everyday so early, since for him there is no weekends or holidays.\r\n<p>\r\nJes\u00fas longs to have a oven of his own and wants to work very hard to provide his family a better life. This is his second loan with MFP.

Two years ago she began to sell food items and vegetables.  Since then she has become increasingly focused on her store and little by little has been increasing the items she stocks.  She really enjoys tending to her store.  So, on top of helping her husband with his banana plantations, she comes back home early to tend to her customers because this produces additional income for her home.  Her greatest difficulty at the moment is not having sufficient funds to stock her store.  This is the reason for requesting this loan, to stock her store with a wider variety of items, especially food items and sweets.

She and her husband work together to raised their big family. They are currently living at Taghangin, Morong, Rizal, Philippines. Josephine is a woman with good faith to defeat all challenges to reach her dreams.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Josephine joined ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.) a micro-finance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines. As a member of ASHI for almost six years, she has shown very good performance in her attendance at center meetings and weekly repayments. Her business still exists and, therefore, she is qualified to acquire larger loans.\r\n\r\nJosephine runs a variety store. She started her store through her initiative in dealing with customers. She wants to continue her business as it gives her a good income to support the educational needs of her children. She is requesting a loan of PHP 25,000 to use as additional capital to improve her business and her income.\r\n\r\nJosephine dreams of growing her variety store into a mini-grocery store and expanding it to other villages. Her seven children are her inspiration to pursue her variety store.\r\n\r\nJosephine now feels very happy with the services of ASHI and Kiva. It gives her a big chance to pursue her family dreams. She hopes that ASHI and Kiva continue the service for a long time and help many families who want to get ahead.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":478455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Elvie is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Elvie from HSPFI.
