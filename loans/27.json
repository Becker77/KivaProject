Posee un puesto estacionario en el cual vende galletas, confites, chocolates, cigarrillos, gaseosas y jugos; adem\u00e1s, presta el servicio de llamadas a tel\u00e9fonos celulares.  El negocio est\u00e1 ubicado en el barrio Chapinero cerca al teatro nacional Fanny Mickey, famoso por realizar las mejores funciones teatrales y musicales del pa\u00eds. El microempresario tiene 26 a\u00f1os de estar ubicado en el mismo sitio donde es ampliamente conocido por los empleados y transe\u00fantes frecuentes del sector.  Es amigo de casi todos sus clientes con quienes  comenta las noticias del d\u00eda mientras les vende un refresco o les regala un f\u00f3sforo para que enciendan un cigarrillo. Cuando observa veh\u00edculos o personas sospechosas no duda en informarle a los vigilantes privados de los edificios cercanos para que estos le reporten a la polic\u00eda. Su jornada laboral comienza a las 8 A.M. y termina a las 7 P.M. Su inclinaci\u00f3n por el comercio la hered\u00f3 de su padre quien fue lotero en un principio y luego tuvo un puesto similar al suyo en el mismo sector de Chapinero.

He has a stationary stand where he sells cookies, sweets, cigarettes, soft drinks, and juice.  He also provides cell phone call service.  The business is located in the Chapinero neighborhood close to the Fanny Mickey National Theater.  The theater is famous for putting on the best theatrical shows and musicals in the country.\r\n\r\nThis small businessman has been located in the same site for 26 years.  He is widely known by the workers and people who frequently pass by the area.  He is friends with almost all of his customers.  He chats with them about the day\u2019s news while he sells them refreshments or gives them a match to light a cigarette.  When he sees a suspicious car or person, he does not hesitate to tell the private watchmen in the buildings that are nearby.  He does this so that the watchmen can report it to the police.\r\n\r\nHis work day starts at 8:00 a.m., and it ends at 7:00 p.m.  He got his propensity for business from his father.  In the beginning his father sold lottery tickets.  Later, his father had a stand similar to the Jaime\u2019s stand in the same area of Chapinero.  Six siblings of Jaime are also merchants.\r\n\r\nThis is his third loan with the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He plans to use the loan to buy wholesale cigarettes, chocolates, and cookies.  This way he gets important discounts for paying in cash and buying in volume.  His average daily sales are 150,000 COP; and his profit margin is 35%.\r\n\r\nIn the future Jaime wants to rent a place to continue his business and to sell breakfast and lunch.  This project will allow him to increase his sales and improve his work conditions.  He sometimes suffers due to inclement weather like the recent winter season.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this small businessman says that he is a happy man.  Together with his business, he is part of the landscape in Bogota.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":684071,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy wholesale cigarettes, chocolates, and cookies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Bogot\u00e0","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-01-03T15:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.38},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T09:26:27Z","rounded_local_amount":65828.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427767},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:47Z","rounded_local_amount":65828.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001206},{"amount":34.38,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:08Z","rounded_local_amount":65828.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289229},{"amount":33.72,"local_amount":61314,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:05:47Z","rounded_local_amount":64578.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157367},{"amount":35.03,"local_amount":63686,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":67077.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230377},{"amount":34.37,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:12Z","rounded_local_amount":65828.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509241},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":125000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:25Z","rounded_local_amount":131656.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673462}],"funded_date":"2011-01-03T23:32:48Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":266857,"name":"Elvis","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Elvis vive en alquiler en la zona de Villa Dolores, de la ciudad de  El Alto, tiene dos hijos, el se\u00f1or es chofer taxista, con los ingresos que obtiene se mantienen; en anterior cr\u00e9dito realiz\u00f3 el mantenimiento de su movilidad.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History: Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Express Auto and Body Paint, because he wanted to provide reliable service to his community while providing secure employment to its hard-working members. Before opening his shop, Raul worked as the manager of the paint department at a large auto shop. However, after being forced to lay off many of the employees under his charge, Raul decided to go out on his own. \r\n\r\nA.R.C. Express Auto opened in September 2010 and offers its customers any auto body service from dent repair to complete paint jobs. Raul used his 10 years of experience, including time working with the U.S. Army, to start the business. He hired and receives ongoing support from three of the employees laid off by his old employer, including an old manager who helps Raul estimate paint and labor costs. \r\n\r\nRaul says his biggest success to date has been keeping the business open and successful while navigating a confusing city-permit process, which nearly led to the close of his shop. Of this, he says, \u201cIn order to keep your business legal, you need to get the right city permits. I would call in and get a different answer from each person regarding these permits. Ultimately, I had to pay someone to figure it out for me because I couldn\u2019t start the shop and engage in that process at the same time.\u201d  Since he started the shop with his personal finances, he said that the strain caused by this added necessity nearly forced him to shut down the business.\r\n\r\nHowever, his loan from Kiva partner ACCION Texas-Louisiana helped Raul overcome this difficulty. He used the loan to make payroll, pay for paint and supplies, and pay off a mortgage on some land, which has since been sold and the money brought back to his business. Without the loan, Raul says, \u201cI would have had to shut down the shop. ACCION Texas helped me see the options available to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the future, Raul hopes to stay true to his community-oriented business policy. He says, \u201cMy goal is to hire some disabled veterans and people with disabilities and give back to the community. My goal is not to get rich; I want to give people a workplace where they come in, enjoy what they do, and go home happy.\u201d  He says that one day he hopes to open another establishment, such as a dance hall, that community organizations can use at an affordable price for recreational functions.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly a year in business, Raul offers the following advice to aspiring business owners: \u201cMake sure you do your homework, and, most importantly, make sure you engage with your customers and the people who affect your business face-to-face.\u201d  With this loan, Raul was able to overcome the initial challenges of opening his business. Now, he can continue to give members of his community a secure job that provides reliable, quality services to the residents of El Paso.

A few years ago, Amable was diagnosed with diabetes, which has affected her productivity and is the reason she now finds herself without sufficient capital to invest. Instead of giving up, she has decided to develop new ideas, like producing bedspreads, curtains, bath mats and other items requested by her customers. As she doesn't have the necessary funds to buy materials, she needs a loan to continue with this project and to increase production, as well as to remodel her kitchen, an aim she shares with her

She was born and was raised in a 100% agricultural and livestock farming family. After many years of learning, she has acquired a lot of experiential knowledge that has been quite effective when it comes to taking care of her farming activities, especially raising small farm animals.  She is a woman with a good sense of humor and lots of optimism in life.  These qualities made her a key figure in her family during times of hardship and lack of money when they lost their crops after a huge cold wave that affected their harvest. They also had to endure other difficult decisions as a family.  Currently she has big projects in mind; she is planning to venture into planting peas and she is preparing her land for crops. In the meantime she is firmly dedicated to breed small farm animals such as hens and guinea pigs in order to support her family, while her husband works as a mason. Mrs. Zenobia, gets up everyday embracing the opportunity to prepare her three children still under her care (of which she had nine) with energy and motivation for life.

Along with her husband they support their 7 children, who are still in school and require a lot of financial support. Thanks to the purchase of a house, they are no longer paying to rent a home.  Due to the size of their family, Dina decided to help out her husband with the expenses and find a way to generate income.  Thanks to the help of one of her neighbors, she was put in touch with workers who requested a meal service. For three years now she has cooked lunches for her customers during the week and she charges them at the end of the month.  She enjoys this work, as she only has to spend the morning preparing meals, to later be delivered, and she has the rest of the time to dedicate to her children.  \r\n\r\nHowever, Dina would now like to work full time and in order to accomplish this she plans to open a restaurant in a market or commercial space, where, along with her children she can invest time and money to make it successful.

It is a purely agricultural area located an hour from the city of Chiclayo. \r\n\r\nHe has been mainly working in agriculture and ranching since childhood. He currently is raising sheep and pigs, which are then sold at the market in Moshoqueque in Chiclayo. This business is one source of income for his home, but does not provide the stability to keep them going.  This is why he has turned to another activity which he has worked at for 18 years: fishing.  During the fishing season he travels with his brothers to San Jose creek to catch fish and then sell it to his neighbors. The area where he lives is far from the sea so this business is very profitable. \r\n\r\nAurelio is thinking about devoting even more time to his fish business and plans to buy more fish. In addition to selling to his neighbors he would like to sell in the surrounding areas. For this reason he is applying for the first time to Edpyme Alternative for a loan of 1000 nuevos soles. \r\n\r\nHe is hardworking and has previously worked as a taxi driver and has always studied how to make electrical connections and bathroom fittings. He is always thinking of ways to support his family and takes advantage of every opportunity presented to him. \r\n\r\nHis greatest dream is to secure a source of work that would provide the stability for his family that they need to succeed. He also dreams of traveling to Spain to work and from there support his family. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Machelle Wilson, Kiva

She married young and has a 14 year old son, who is in school. She started a small mobile business selling fruits and vegetables, and with her husband's help, she was able to set up a small shop, which she has been running for 3 years. She also sells firewood, which her husband cuts down on their land. He is a farmer and rents land to cultivate. He grows beans and tomatoes and with this he supports and helps his family with their needs. Because of a lack of capital, they have not been able to increase their inventory.

She is 43 years old and sells \"nacatamales\", a local food made with pork, dough, spices, potatoes, rice and others (similar to a tamale). She normally sells them on weekends. At first she butchered the meat but it took a lot of effort si she decided to purchase it instead to prepare the product.\r\n\r\nIsabel sells her \"nacatamales\" in Tipitaba since there is more competition. She dreams of opening a small shop. She has five children.

Mejorada in the district of Mariscal C\u00e1ceres in Huancavelica. Situated on the right bank of the Mantaro River, at an altituD. of between 2600 and 3600, the community has a mild climate and can be accessed from the towns of Huancavelica and Huancayo by both rail and road. Farming (cereal crops, potatoes, beans, vegetables); animal husbandry (sheep, cattle, and young animals); as well as commerce and tourism are the main activities. \r\nTeresa A. is married and has eight children. She began her business 8 years ago with a small amount of capital, but because of health problems, she lost everything. She began selling meals and opened a small store that she still runs. With the loan that she receives, she plans to increase her stock. Now she not only sells from her store but also from a stall that she has in a school. Her dream is to see her children become professionals, especially her four youngest children as the older ones are married and she does not have the means to have them study.\r\nPaulina S. is married and has five children. She started work with FINCA six months ago when she invested her first loan in the purchase of guinea pigs and chickens. Beforehand she could not sell anything because no one would lend her money, whereas now she buys and sells young animals. She has succeeded in increasing her income and now has no problems putting bread on the table. Her dream is to save enough to buy a plot of land so she can live there with her mother-in-law.\r\nSaturnina F. is married and has four children. In the past she used to wash clothes for a living, but now she sells anticuchos (type of kebab) and fried foods. She used to have problems with her husband because he drank too much, but now he has work, and so she has been able to overcome her difficulties. With the loan she has managed to buy a kebab stand, and now she earns more than before and has more money to spend on her children. Saturnina\u2019s plan is to save money so that her children can lead happy lives and lack for nothing\u2014especially where their education is concerned.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1675,"image":{"id":213239,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"The Bank Lucero del Amanecer needs 5100 soles so that its 13 members can invest in their businesses.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-10-16T07:30:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1675,"lender_count":49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Vilma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela Catherina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Paulina Leona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benedicta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Victoria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Helga Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Saturnina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ayda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Norma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fausta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-30T17:36:29Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":5100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":850},{"due_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","amount":850}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":279.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":279.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T04:11:32Z","rounded_local_amount":861.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5314864},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2008-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:46:14Z","rounded_local_amount":861.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9932484},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":861.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10214779},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:27:51Z","rounded_local_amount":861.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20396509},{"amount":279.17,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-03-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":861.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088288},{"amount":279.15,"local_amount":850,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":861.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35981822}],"funded_date":"2008-10-16T17:36:29Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T16:13:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":73476,"name":"Mavlyuda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Problems and money shortages never defeated Mavlyuda, who has always looked for a way to get past obstacles and continue to improve her situation.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is 36 year old Naomi D. from Mwanza.  She is married. She is also responsible for supporting two orphan dependents. Naomi has been running a poultry business since 2008. D. has a Poultry\/kuku business. Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially among SELFINA clients. Kuku means chickens in Swahili, and raising them for sale is popular for a number of reasons. First, they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Second, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income, or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein. She works at the business for 4 hours per day, 7 days per week and is assisted by one employee. Naomi currently earns about 160USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 400USD in order to buy chicks to raise and resell. In the future, she plans to expand her business. D. thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285216,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Poultry","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy more chicks raise and resell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Naomi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:00Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027589},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613590},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010669},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:13Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232955},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664746}],"funded_date":"2009-03-09T22:23:22Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Dave Gibbons","image":608904}},{"id":98052,"name":"Mari","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mari M. is twenty-eight years old.

her business. She will use this loan to purchase flour and fish, as well as to cover transportation and rent costs.   \r\n \r\nThis is Mercy\u2019s third loan from GHAPE since she became a beneficiary in 2007. Mercy trusts her business will be a successful one because she thinks she has a good site at which she operates her business. Her customer base is also consistent and Mercy is skillful in her activities. \r\n\r\nLike most entrepreneurial mothers, Mercy plans to use the profits from the loans to pay for her children\u2019s school fees. The profits will also go towards purchasing food and clothing for the family. Mercy enjoys being a GHAPE member and likes the group of entrepreneurs she works with. \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":363348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Market","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fish and flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Alabukam, Mankon, NW.

It is thanks to this support that they have improved their incomes and consequently, their quality of life. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1775,"image":{"id":666960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cooking oil, drinks, canned goods, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PY","country":"Paraguay","town":"Villarrica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-22.993333 -57.996389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":58,"posted_date":"2010-12-16T13:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1775,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Laura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patricia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosmari","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Grisel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercedes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nilda|","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eduarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Iris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PYG","disbursal_amount":8085695,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2010-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2010-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":505356},{"due_date":"2011-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":505355}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.93},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.93},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.93},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.93},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":110.94}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":665.63,"local_amount":3032136,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:15:26Z","rounded_local_amount":3061875.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188690118},{"amount":1109.37,"local_amount":5053559,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:40:55Z","rounded_local_amount":5103124.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191429368}],"funded_date":"2010-12-17T04:33:21Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:40:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":262793,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Gladys tiene 53 a\u00f1os, vive con su hijo en la casa de un familiar.

With the help of her past 11 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Zoraida has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 5,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285251,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy rice, cooking oil, sugar and wheat flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T20:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027596},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613597},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:35Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010676},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232962},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:18Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664753}],"funded_date":"2009-03-09T22:58:06Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Adam Sutcliffe","image":null}},{"id":98068,"name":"Astou S\u00e8ne","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Astou S\u00e8ne D. est une vendeuse de bois morts pour faire la cuisine surtout dans les villages et lors des c\u00e9r\u00e9monies, elle a trois ans d\u2019exp\u00e9rience.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A. is 25 years old and lives with her husband, to whom she has been married for 10 years now. She is from the Las Trancas community, which belongs to the Tlalixcoyan municipality. Her community is well-known because people there mainly grow rice, cucumbers, and corn\u2014the latter being the community\u2019s main means of support. <p>\r\nIn the beginning, she used to help her husband cultivate rice, but she states that it was very heavy work for her, and the weather conditions caused her to have health problems. <p>\r\nFor this reason, Lorena looked for another way to help her husband financially, so she decided to set up her own stationery store because they did not have any in the area; residents had to travel to nearby communities. <p>\r\nShe has been in business for only 6 months, and she decided to request a loan in order to better stock her store and provide better customer service. <p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Lore, as she is known by her neighbors, is a member of the Las Rositas Group, which is comprised of 10 people who own general stores, candy stores, beverage stores, clothing and shoe stores. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2500,"image":{"id":373228,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Paper Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase notebooks, crayons, pencil boxes, and poster boards ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"PIEDRAS NEGRAS, VER.

La Granja is a commune, which is located in the area south of the great Santiago, the capital of Chile.  It belongs to an urban territory with houses and important businesses having to do with wood, factories, and metals.\r\n\r\nThese members work at different independent businesses like making clothes, a bakery, a pastry shop, handicrafts, decoupage (decoration of objects like wooden boxes, bottles, and pictures), greengrocery, grocery store, hair salon, making and repairing footwear, and preparing and selling fast food.\r\n\r\nCarolina was the member that was interviewed.  She is the secretary of this group.  In the photo you can find her in the last row to the right.  She is wearing a short sleeve orange t-shirt.  She sells vegetables and prepared salads in her house.  She will use the loan to buy bags for the salads and vegetables.  Also, she will save to buy a used light truck to purchase merchandise. \r\n\r\nHer dreams are to have a kiosk, which would also serve as a convenience store within the same field (greengrocer), and to have a stall in a fair.  Her great desire is to improve her quality of life, increase her earnings, and contribute to the family expenses.  For example, she would like to help buy her mother\u2019s medications.  Her great motivators are her small son and a small niece that she is raising.\r\n\r\nCarolina told us that when she first started working with Fondo Esperanza she was afraid of being a guarantor for people she did not know (the colleagues in her group because this is the Fondo Esperanza\u2019s system).  Driven by her projections and dreams, she dared to participate in these loans.  The results have been very satisfactory because she has felt supported and secure.  She also says that there is a great deal of solidarity among the members of the group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Ruth works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Ruth currently earns about US$318 from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to purchase cloth and dye for making batik.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":304687,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Textiles","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cloth and dye for making batik.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-04-16T20:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ruth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":90909.09},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":90909.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2009-05-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:16:06Z","rounded_local_amount":93880.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613754},{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:04:17Z","rounded_local_amount":93880.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010833},{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2009-07-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":93880.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233119},{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2009-08-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:55:47Z","rounded_local_amount":93880.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664910},{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:50:31Z","rounded_local_amount":93880.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105622},{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:33:38Z","rounded_local_amount":93880.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022734},{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":93880.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867975},{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:52Z","rounded_local_amount":93880.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757176},{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:40Z","rounded_local_amount":93880.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146288},{"amount":70.45,"local_amount":90909.09,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:23Z","rounded_local_amount":93880.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984450},{"amount":70.5,"local_amount":90909.1,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:52Z","rounded_local_amount":93880.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015147}],"funded_date":"2009-04-16T22:56:08Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":106276,"name":"Natsagdorj","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Natsagdorj T. is 40, married and the father of two sons.

She is 52 years old. Edelien is married and has two adult children. To make a living, Edelien owns & operates a specialized retail store selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap & toothpaste, canned goods, bread etc. in the local community. Edelien has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 3,300 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Edelien joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Edelien has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offerings. Edelien is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Edelien from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to save as a reserve for future emergencies. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":431951,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Government Technical Institute, Magburaka, was founded in 1962 by the government for the promotion of technical and vocational education. They teach mechanical engineering, carpentry and joinery, block laying and concreting, automobile engineering, plumbing and sheet metal work, painting and decoration and many more subjects. Presently, the institute has a total of 17 staff and 300 pupils. <P>\r\n\r\nGovernment Technical Institute Magburaka is the only government technical institute in Magburaka town. Over the years, the institution has been able to train many technicians serving both within and without Sierra Leone. It makes good grades at the external examinations organized by City and Guilds of London Institute. The institution also serves as a consultancy and guard to the people of Magburaka. <P>\r\n\r\nThis is the second loan Government Technical Institute is requesting from Kiva through SMT. School staff from this institution, like many other schools' staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish certain tasks that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone. But with the help of this loan, some can pay school fees for their children; others can use the loan to buy pieces of furniture, a plot of land, house-building materials, or invest in business. At the end of each month, these teachers can repay the loan out of their monthly salaries. The institution\u2019s bursar is directly responsible for deducting the repayment and pays SMT on their behalf.<P>\r\n\r\n\r\nSantigie A. T.

Santigie is 56 years old, married and has 3 children \u2013 1 in Senior Secondary School and 2 already grown-ups and on their own. Santigie has been teaching for 10 years now. With his share of the loan, Santigie will pay school fees for his child and invest the rest in his farm.

The community is known for being a mountainous zone near the northern border of the country.  Her principal economic activities are livestock and agriculture, specifically the planting of basic grains, sugar cane, and oranges.\r\n\r\nA year ago, Ms. Seydy decided to start her own business, so she opened a boookstore.

She assures her business improved the quality of life for her and her son.  She believes it is time to move forward and enlarge her store.\r\n\r\nCurrently, she needs a loan of \u00a2665000 (six hundred sixty-five thousand colones) to buy more books to stock her bookstore.  This will allow her to offer greater and better services that will be able to satisfy the needs of the community, particularly the students.\r\n\r\nMs. Seydy is a member of the community bank Manantial in Santa Fe, one of the 100 member organizations of EDESA in Costa Rica.

She and her husband work together to raise their big family. They are currently living at Talim, Binangonan Rizal, Philippines. Litia is a woman of good faith who wishes to conquer all challenges to achieve her family's dreams. \r\nLitia\u2019s main goal is to build a sustainable business to meet the needs of her five children. To do this, she was encouraged to join Kiva partner, ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), a microfinance institution in the Philippines, in 2007. The previous loans she has received from ASHI were carefully invested in her sari-sari (variety) store. Since then, the business has been performing well and earning her sufficient profit. She is grateful that she has been able to educate her children using proceeds from her business as she continues to expand. Litia now needs a loan to boost her business for increased profitability.\r\nLitia started her sari-sari store on her own initiative. She wants to continue her business, and is requesting a loan of 20,000 PHP to use as additional capital to improve her business and income. Specifically, the money will be used to purchase five sacks of rice, charcoal, sugar, canned goods, cigarettes, fabric conditioner and other supplies for her store. \r\nLitia dreams of growing her variety store into a mini-grocery store and expanding it to other villages. Her family is her inspiration to pursue her business. She now feels very happy with ASHI's services as they give her a big chance to pursue her family's dreams. She hopes that they continue their services for a long time and help many families who want to get ahead.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":532443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

It is a village whose inhabitants work making handicrafts on looms such as 'enaguas' (traditional skirts) and napkins.\r\n\r\nThis group has 11 members who all work in different businesses.  Albina and Elana make 'enaguas' (traditional skirts), Rosa and Sofia sell 'antojitos' (traditional Mexican snacks), Juana, Maria and Leonarda sell groceries, Elvira, Gisela and Adela make napkins and Catalino makes pizzas.\r\n\r\nThis group's representative is Rosa H.

She requested this loan so that she could buy supplies such as corn for making tortillas, meat, tomatoes, chilis, etc. since she sells snacks such as golden chicken tacos, beef tacos and enchiladas in the elementary school in her village.\r\n\r\nAnother of the group's members is Juana Jim\u00e9nez G\u00f3mez who is married to Rogelio H., a farmer.  They have three children who are in school.  Juana's business is making napkins and traditional skirts using a backstrap loom.  This is an activity that she learned when she was very young since it was an inheritance from her ancestors.  It has helped her to cover her family expenses.  This is a very laborious task but the result is very beautiful and her handicrafts are recognized throughout the region.

There she formed her family together with her husband, 32 year-old Jorge.  They have three children who they care for with a lot of love and affection.  They live in a rented house.\r\n\r\nThe main business activity in this area is farming.  Elizabeth learned to work and live off the land when she was a young girl.  Since then she has worked growing peas, potatoes and flowers on a plot of land which she rents.  She has been working in agriculture for five years and is very happy with her work since she is always traveling to the capital city to sell the vegetables that she grows throughout the year.  What she most enjoys about her work is being able to further develop the knowledge that she gained from her parents.\r\n\r\nElizabeth is going to sow flowers and potatoes since this is the season where there is most demand.  \"You invest a little and earn a lot\" she tells us.  Elizabeth has the support of her husband who works every day for a company in the area.  Elizabeth also looks after her children and she works to provide them with a better quality of life.  Elizabeth is saving up so that she can buy her own plot of land and extend her sowing.  In this way, she will earn more and be able to buy a small home for her family.\r\n\r\nElizabeth is a member of the \"Los \u00c1ngeles de Llanco\" community bank and this is her first loan with MFP.  She hopes to receive your cooperation so that she can continue achieving her goals.  For her part, she pledges to make her loan repayments on time.  Elizabeth enjoys being a member of her community bank because all the members are responsible people who are very supportive of each other.\r\n\r\nWith your support, Elizabeth will invest the money she is requesting in buying two bags of pea seeds that she will sow soon on irrigated land.

Alicia como buena peruana le encanta el conocido platillo \u201cArroz con Pollo\u201d, ella nos comenta que no hay nadie que la pueda igualar en la preparaci\u00f3n.\n\nAlicia es muy buena cocinera y trabaja vendiendo uno de los platos bandera de nuestro pa\u00eds El Ceviche, trabaja alrededor de 7 horas diarias; ella vende su producto en un triciclo al cual le ha adaptado un mostrador para colocar all\u00ed el ceviche y mantener la comida con higiene, tiene muchos clientes puede atender en un d\u00eda alrededor de 30 clientes y a veces tanta es la acogida que se agota muy r\u00e1pido y muchos clientes se quedan sin ser atendidos.\n\nActualmente Alicia est\u00e1 muy agradecida con los prestatarios Kiva ya que gracias a su ayuda ella podr\u00e1 renovar su triciclo en el cual labora y tambi\u00e9n comprar uno nuevo, para que su hija tambi\u00e9n la pueda ayudar en la venta del producto, con esta mejora podr\u00e1 tener mayores ingresos ya que desean ambas ahorrar el suficiente dinero para que puedan cumplir uno de los sue\u00f1os m\u00e1s grandes que tiene Alicia y es: Darle la carrera de Enfermer\u00eda T\u00e9cnica a su hija\u201d y por el cual Alicia no descansara hasta ver hecho realizad su sue\u00f1o ya que desea que su hija sea mejor que ella.\n","en":"Alicia is a very tenacious woman who has worked hard and sacrificed a lot in order to provide for her 15-year-old daughter who is currently in the fourth year of her secondary education.  Owing to circumstances beyond her control, Alicia was left alone shortly after her daughter was born.  Alicia is very happy in spite of the setbacks that she has suffered.  She would have loved to have studied to become a nurse but, owing to her parents' limited financial resources, she was only able to study up to the fourth year of her secondary education.\r\n\r\nLike all good Peruvians, Alicia loves the well-known dish 'arroz con pollo' (chicken and rice).  She tells us that she has no equal when it comes to preparing this dish.  Alicia is a very good cook and her business is selling one of our country's most important dishes: 'ceviche' (a marinated seafood dish).  She works around 7 hours a day and sells her food from a three-wheeled vehicle to which she has added a counter where she can place the ceviche and keep it in hygienic conditions.  She has many customers.  Every day she is able to serve approximately 30 customers and sometimes the food is so well received that she runs out very quickly and many customers are unable to get served.\r\n\r\nAlicia is very grateful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their help, she will be able to renovate the three-wheeled vehicle from which she works and also buy a new one so that her daughter can help her sell her food.  This improvement will enable her to make more income as both she and her daughter want to save up enough money to fulfill one of Alicia's biggest dreams which is to enable her daughter to study for a degree in nursing.  Alicia will not rest until she has seen her dream come true as she wants her daughter to do better than her."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":981638,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She is an honest, sensible, charismatic, and hard-working woman. She is a wise farmer who is respected by her neighbors and fellow farmers as a mentor. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Kitale, which is in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. \n\nNorah is happily married and is blessed with a lovely family. For the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming, growing maize and vegetables. She also has dairy cows. Norah has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with the challenge of delivering the produce in a timely manner to the market. This challenge has not discouraged her. She states: \u201cI have to do something for my family.\" \n\nNorah joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists smallholder women like her. She requests a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Norah is from a remote village that has poor roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables, and tomatoes) that require timely delivery to the market. This loan will help Norah to achieve her dream and reach her goals. \n\nAccessing a financial solution for women in Kenya is an uphill battle, but Norah feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva that help women gain respect and equality among their male counterparts. \n\nThe benefits of this loan are many because Norah will never suffer losses due to delays in delivering produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. Her income will increase.\n\nNorah is making a change for herself and for others in the community because she intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike and help with farm work. Norah will use the loan to improve her living conditions and assure her children of a secure future.\n\nYou can be part of this dream.

She is requesting a loan of $550 in order to keep up the maintenance of her business as well as expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nDementria thanks you for her support!"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":223127,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To expand her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-11-19T03:20:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dementria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":75000},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:12:27Z","rounded_local_amount":79681.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970743},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":79681.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886960},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:30Z","rounded_local_amount":79681.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436220},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":75000,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:44Z","rounded_local_amount":79681.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130492}],"funded_date":"2008-11-19T15:50:34Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Margo Huennekens","image":null}},{"id":77620,"name":"Celestino Minaya","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"C. forma parte del Banco Comunal \u201cMujeres de Grandes Retos\u201d del distrito de Independencia, provincia de Huaraz, departamento de Ancash.\n\nTiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada con un profesor y no tiene hijos.

She makes the utmost effort to provide comfort to her family by fulfilling their needs. \r\n\r\nHer husband is involved in a food sales business.  He specifically sells breakfast item like Nan Chanay (made with chick peas and served with bread and salad) from a four-wheeled cart.  Muzamil helps him by preparing the food items that he sells in public places.  He has been operating this business for the past 16 years and has developed a good reputation among his clients.  He earns a good profit from this business everyday.\r\n  \r\nMuzamil has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah to further expand her husband\u2019s business.  With the loan, he will buy the required ingredients such as chick peas, spices, cooking oil, etc. needed to make the Nan Chanay in larger quantity which will help him sell more to his clients and earn more profits.  She is hopeful that this investment will be a productive one for her husband and will help him make his business more profitable.  \r\nShe is a regular loan user of Asasah and this is her 5th loan application.  In previous loan years, she has maintained a good credit behavior and never missed a single meeting. \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the lady with a book (called Asasah Passbook) is Muzamil. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":708065,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy required ingredients for food selling business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PK","country":"Pakistan","town":"Arifwala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"30.283333 73.066667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":60,"posted_date":"2011-02-07T13:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muzamil","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Salamatay","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PKR","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-11-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3200},{"due_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.86},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.85},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.86},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.86},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.86},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.85},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.86},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.86},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.85},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.86},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.43}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":38.86,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3322.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201232982},{"amount":38.85,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":3322.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206099387},{"amount":38.86,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:35:44Z","rounded_local_amount":3322.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211169790},{"amount":38.86,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:35:39Z","rounded_local_amount":3322.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216452533},{"amount":38.86,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:18:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3322.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221616488},{"amount":77.71,"local_amount":6400,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T07:54:11Z","rounded_local_amount":6645.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226985617},{"amount":38.86,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:21:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3322.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232744462},{"amount":38.85,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:23:51Z","rounded_local_amount":3322.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238548947},{"amount":38.86,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:17:20Z","rounded_local_amount":3322.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244507744},{"amount":36.43,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:20:47Z","rounded_local_amount":3115.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250715420}],"funded_date":"2011-02-07T17:36:26Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:20:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jim Lee","image":null}},{"id":275132,"name":"Meas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Meas S., 42, is married and resides with her four children in Kampong Cham province, Cambodia, an area known for rubber plantations.
