about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Benefitting from the support of his village, he was able to learn woodturning.  With an initial loan of $550 that he repaid in regular installments, he was able to open his own workshop, which he named \u00abAimons la Vie\u00bb, that is, Let\u2019s Love Life.  Very energetic and of good conscience, he extended the reach of his business into certain villages near Ts\u00e9vi\u00e9.  He is married and the father of three children.  His wife got training in hairdressing with his help and support.  An honest man, Joseph can be trusted, and he has efficiently mastered his business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. K. is requesting a loan of $1,500 which in part will serve to buy a new machine and to pay for boards.

Seeing as his salary wasn't enough to cover the family's basic needs, much less pay for the children's education, Clara decided to open a business one year ago selling clothes to family and friends.  At first she sold them on consignment to give her customers time to pay her, but this meant she couldn't recuperate her cost quickly.  This is why she started to sell cosmetics as well to try to recuperate her cost faster.<p>\r\nHer customer base has grown slowly but surely.  Clara would like to offer a larger selection of products to decrease the time between her investment in the product and profit from its sale.  She knows the ins and outs of her business well and would like loan of $250 to purchase cosmetic products to meet the demand of her customers.  She will pay back the loan in 4-8 months.

They will buy their goods either in Bamako (the nation's capital) or locally in Sikasso and from neighbouring villages, from the farmers themselves.\r\n\r\nThey sell their products retail and for cash in the markets of Sikasso and from home, mainly to women and men.\r\n\r\nThey expect to each make a monthly average profit of 15,000 FCFA which they will use to pay the interest on the loan and to support their families.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":259956,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy firewood, children's clothing, used clothing, fruit and various articles for resale.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aichata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":375000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":null,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":89397,"name":"Sonagnon F\u00e9licienne","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Originaire d'Odja,elle vit le jour le 08\/04\/1973 \u00e0 Houl\u00e8nou.

She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: Tricycle Operator, Networking and Buy & Selling Dried Fish \/ Charcoal businesses.  Her husband Ramon L., who is 50 years old, works as a Tricycle Driver to earn his living.  They have 3 children who are 20 to 24 years old.  \r\n\r\nLolita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lolita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus raising the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 20th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital\/maintenance so that she could continue to save up for the future education of her children.  Lolita L. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

They are on their 14th loan with the Microfinance Institution Soro Yiriwaso to help meet the needs of their clients. Aminata, pictured first in the large boubou, sells potatoes. She has been doing this for about 14 years and has a very good reputation. With her loan, she plans to buy about ten 50kg sacks of potatoes. She buys from producers in the neighborhoods in Sikasso. She resells them, by order, at the market, and to family; she has both male and female customers. She plans to make an average monthly profit of 43,500 FCFA which will partly be used to pay for the loan and its interest and the other part for savings. She hopes to increase her business to better satisfy her customers.

He was obligated to have Teodora work and to look for help from a friend of hers, whose job it is to do the sanding and polishing until each piece they make shines.\r\n\r\nTeodora and her husband in all their time of living together have tried to work in harmony making furniture, with the end of being able to make it into a well known furniture shop in the area, and so have a profitable activity so that when their children grow up they will work there too.  Carpentry at the moment is very profitable and they have received contracts from several organisations.  Currently Teodora is the president of a community bank, where she has received 5 loans from MFP, and in all this time she has not had problems making the corresponding payments.

Despu\u00e9s empez\u00f3 a traer pescado de Tasajera, corregimiento en el departamento de Bol\u00edvar, y se compr\u00f3 un enfriador para guardarlo. Una gran parte de la clientela de Liliana llega a su negocio porque vive al lado de un cementerio y es costumbre desayunar con fritos y pescado, especialmente en cuaresma.\nEste cr\u00e9dito y los nuevos activos que ha ido adquiriendo han incrementado las ventas pues cuando empez\u00f3, solo ten\u00eda un peque\u00f1o capital y no ten\u00eda infraestructura. En el futuro sue\u00f1a con que su negocio contin\u00fae creciendo y que sus ingresos se incrementen, permiti\u00e9ndole terminar la educaci\u00f3n de sus cuatro hijos en edades entre los 14 y 6 a\u00f1os. M\u00e1s adelante quiere construir un local para independizar su negocio que actualmente est\u00e1 en su casa.\n","en":"Liliana Patricia C. T. is a 33 year old woman from Malambo, a municipality within the metropolitan area of Barranquilla.  There she sells fried foods, vegetables, and fish from her house.  Liliana has been affiliated with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for one year.  At that time, she received a loan so that she could purchase chairs, tables, a heater, a food mill, and a supply of fish.  Now she is seeking to expand her business with a loan of 2,000,000 COP so that she can buy fish, a large container of oil, corn in bulk amounts, and a small freezer.\r\n<p>\r\nFive years ago, Liliana started her business selling fried foods and vegetables so that she could help her husband with the family expenses.  She took advantage of the experience she learned from her father, who operated his own vending post at the market for 15 years.   Afterwards she began bringing in fish from Tasajera, the location of the magistrate for the Department of Bol\u00edvar.  She also bought a cooler for storing them.  Most of her customers come to her business because she lives next to a cemetery, and it is customary to eat fried fish, especially during Lent.\r\n<p>\r\nThese loans and the new assets that she has acquired have helped increase her sales since she started her business.  She had very little capital and no infrastructure.  In the future, she dreams of continuing to grow her business and increasing her earnings.  This will allow her children to finish their education since they are between the ages of 6 and 14.  Later on, she wants to build a separate location for her business since it is currently in her home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Ismael took advantage of a small plot of land that his parents bought for him and began growing cacao.  He presently owns a considerable amount of land that he uses to grow and sell products such as cacao and coca leaf so that he can improve his family\u2019s quality of life.  For Ismael, his children are the reason for his existence since they provide him great strength to press forward even though the road of life has many obstacles.\r\n<p>\r\nIsmael usually sells his products at the local collection centers.  Lately his sales have been improving as compared to previous months.  His relatives normally help him with the work in the fields.  He works from 6am to 6pm and has been engaged in farming for almost ten years.  His future plans include buying a mobile fast food cart so that his wife can work and earn extra income.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP.  Ismael is appreciative of the services that he has received.  Therefore, he promises to complete his payments.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from raising pigs for fattening and sale. Angelita has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Angelita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Angelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase hog feed and other supplies. Angelita is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional piglets to raise. This will be the 5th loan taken out by Angelita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

S. is 46 years old, married, and has two children in his care. His eldest son is 22 years old and is in the 3rd year of his studies, while his youngest son is 20 years old and is in the 1st year of his studies. His life partner works as a housekeeper and earns a very low salary. Her goals are to increase the number of her clients so that she may expand her business, and to be known in other places for her superb work and fulfillment of every work commitment. Her hope is that her sons finish their studies so that they become professionals recognized in their city and in the whole country. Wilfredo\u2019s dream is to be able to own an air conditioned shop with the necessary tools to be able to complete more work in the body shop trade, however, because of a lack of the certain tools he does not commit himself to carry out certain jobs. \r\n\r\nWilfredo\u2019s economic undertaking is a body shop service. His business is located on the road, and he has owned his business for the past 8 years. Wilfredo got started in this business because his brother gave him the opportunity to work with him and later he decided to establish his own business. He began his business in a on the road fashion because he did not have the means to carry out all his work in the house in which he lives because it is too small. His brother aided him and facilitated the means by which he could complete his jobs. Later Wilfredo decided to purchase his own tools and as time passed he was recognized for the quality of his work given that he has many friends that require his services. In this way he was able to acquire his own clients and his own business for which he now needs a loan for work capital given that he needs to purchase paints, bars to weld tools repairs, and new tools.  He will carry out all these tasks in Managua since he knows certain places that will give him the best results. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":260090,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Work capital to purchase paints, tool repairs, and new tools.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-01-23T20:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilfredo Antonio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":888.89},{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":888.88}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.22},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.24}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":931.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20400002},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":931.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092000},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:39:34Z","rounded_local_amount":931.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985383},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":931.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44445999},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:40:02Z","rounded_local_amount":931.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956640},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-05T09:30:38Z","rounded_local_amount":931.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66055574},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:29:19Z","rounded_local_amount":931.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599691},{"amount":47.22,"local_amount":888.89,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":931.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035584},{"amount":47.24,"local_amount":888.88,"processed_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:37:38Z","rounded_local_amount":931.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947993}],"funded_date":"2009-01-23T23:15:07Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T21:37:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariela Cede\u00f1o","image":883126}},{"id":89429,"name":"Oniyo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Oniyo sells motor spare parts.

His sons live with relatives in Lima because they are studying there.  Jorge has planted potatoes on his own parcels of land for 28 years.  He suffered a tremendous loss because of a cold snap, and low market prices, a while ago and has not been able to recuperate his losses.  Therefore, he decided to also cultivate beans, which have proved to be profitable and to cost less.  He plants them on the same land he\u2019s cultivated potatoes and has to fertilize constantly to get lush plants that soon explode with pods of beans.\r\n\r\nJorge loves his crops.  When he goes to Lima to visit his sons, he misses them so he goes back to work his piece of land, that thanks to his care can grow and produce good crops that are profitable.  \r\n\r\nThis is his eighth loan with MFP.  He paid his former installments on time and earned the trust of his fellow communal bank members.  They nominated him treasurer, a position he takes seriously working for the good of the group.

She began this job after forming the committee of women. She offers her merchandise from her house and also leaves to offer in houses of her friends. It has gone well up to now as it creates an income, which she invests in her house for various things, and now she wants to buy more  items of clothing to have more varieties like T-shirts, dresses, sweaters, pants,  and jeans.

She has taken on various occupations throughout her life, until finally she found the best business for her family. Among the various occupations she has had, the ones she developed the most are agriculture, farming, and catering. She currently sells foods itinerantly. She equips herself with a small awning and with a table and chairs so that her clients can make themselves comfortable while they enjoy the foods which she prepared. Her children help her with her business in attending to the customers. This is how she passes her days: during the morning she sells her foods and in the afternoons she feeds her livestock. But during the harvest season the entire family partakes in the activity to try to collect the products.

She lives in the city of Cartagena and is a married mother of 2 children, aged 20 and 24. Her dream is for them to be successful. 17 years ago, with severance pay from a job she used to have in a business, she began her business activity. First she sold fish, later merchandise. Gradually she gained acceptance and built her clientele. She began to sell ceramic items. She also paints little ceramic cookies, which serve as souvenirs for first communions, children's parties, quincea\u00f1eras, graduations, and decorations. She also paints pictures. All of this activity has allowed her to develop her artistic talent and because of that she feels very happy.

The second location is where Muhsin's sales person mostly sells shoes. Muhsin works for an Italian company called Katri that produces fabric for making clothes. However, his salary at Katri is insufficient for supporting his family. <p>\r\n\r\nHis neighbor recommended that Muhsin apply for a loan at Microinvest in order to expand his business. Now is a season for summer clothes, and Muhsin needs to purchase goods for resale. He hopes to obtain a loan from Kiva via Microinvest in order to expand his business by purchasing seasonal men's and children's clothing.\t<p><b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva

She is married and has a kid. Difficult living conditions forced her husband to leave to earn money in Russia. Mavzuna has been running a grocery store for the past 5 years. Currently, her business is the only source of income for her family of a little child and the parents of her husband. She sells sweets, preserved food, juices, soft drinks and also detergents in her grocery store. The inventory she has for sale is of very good quality and selection. Mavzuna is respectful and patient with all of her customers, which attracts people and brings them back to her vending facility to buy groceries again. Mavzuna is seeking to keep her business sustainable and has requested a loan to increase inventory. We believe this current loan will enhance the potential of her business and help Mavzuna reach all of her aspirations.     \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

For two years, she studied to become a hairstylist.  In order to pursue her course work, Leydi had to awaken at 5:00 in the morning to bring guavas, wildflowers, mushrooms and churros to Zitacuaro to sell from very early in the day at some of the open air markets in the town.   In the afternoons, she worked in a caf\u00e9 that is located outside the institute where she studied. \r\n<p>\r\nNow, her greatest wish is to have the basic products necessary in order to start a hair styling business in her community.  She wants to begin with a simple establishment where she can cut hair, provide hairdos, and repair nails and where people interested in this service, primarily young people who attend school, can get their hair cut in the community.\r\n<p>\r\nLeydi is an independent young woman accustomed to looking after herself because, when she was very small, her parents left her under the care of her grandparents, who were already very old, and now she has the responsibility of caring for them.  Her greatest dream is to have her salon where she can offer her services to the community and from which she can obtain income in order to support herself and her grandparents.\r\n<br

She is 54 years old. Ignacia is widowed and has three grown children. To make a living, Ignacia owns and operates a service-based business. The main source of income for the business comes from providing transportation in the local community. Ignacia has been engaged in her business for over ten years and earns approximately 6,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Ignacia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ignacia is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP, which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nNote: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

In order to meet this objective, she is asking for her first loan, through Edpyme Alternativa, of 1,000 PEN ($375) to buy furniture and utensils.\r\n\r\nFanny is a very hard working and enterprising woman with a high regard for commitment and responsibility.  Her greatest desire is to open a restaurant within the zone.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":505663,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Set up a second food stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ort\u00edz - Chiclayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-03-16T22:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fanny Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.12},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":42.43},{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":42.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":42.82},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":43.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":43.7},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":44.02},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":44.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":44.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":45.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.53},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":46.34},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":46.68},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":46.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":47.29},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":47.72},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":48.07},{"due_date":"2010-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":48.12},{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":48.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":48.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.8},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15.91},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.03},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.06},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.26},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.39},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.51},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.56},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.87},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.08},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.37},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.51},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.73},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":17.9},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.03},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.04},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.28},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":47.74,"local_amount":127.3,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:45:40Z","rounded_local_amount":135.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128934685},{"amount":65.22,"local_amount":173.92,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:06Z","rounded_local_amount":184.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662306},{"amount":67.18,"local_amount":179.16,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":190.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695010},{"amount":86.71,"local_amount":231.22,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":245.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878055},{"amount":71.7,"local_amount":191.2,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:50:57Z","rounded_local_amount":203,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618083},{"amount":36.45,"local_amount":97.2,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:05Z","rounded_local_amount":103.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832486}],"funded_date":"2010-03-17T02:06:51Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:05Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

To prepare her kenkey, she buys maize from the market and soaks it in a lot, or enough, water to soften the maize. She washes it on the third day and sends it to the mill to be milled. She then makes a mixture of dough out of the milled wet corn and leaves it to prove for the next day. She divides the proved dough into two and uses one half for her firm half-cooked dough. She mixes it with water to get it into a porridge form, cooks it for some time to get a firm mixture or texture of the dough. Then she mixes the rest of the uncooked dough with the half-cooked portion. She moulds into balls and wraps them in corn husk. She cooks them again till they become soft to eat. Kenkey can be eaten with various kinds of sauces such as pepper sauce, with fried or roasted fish, roasted chicken, roasted turkey or any other kind of meat or fish.\r\n\r\nEkua is married to a farmer and has four children.

Ni\u00f1o, Manolo Fortich, Bukidnon. She is 53 years old. Flora is widowed and has 6 adult children. To make a living, Flora owns & operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes  from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, junk foods, canned goods, biscuits, breads, & detergents in the local community. Flora has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Flora joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Flora has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products for sale. Flora is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory for sale and as working capital. This will be the 4th loan taken out by Flora from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Marites is requesting a new loan of 17,000 PHP which will also be used to purchase additional supplies for her store. This loan will be the 10th loan taken out by Marites from ASKI.

She is married and has one daughter. Her husband is employed in a concrete production company with a low salary. Nada wants to improve her family life by purchasing new home furniture but the amount of money she has isn't enough to pay, so she needs to take a loan of $1,214.07 from FATEN. When Nada gets her FATEN loan, which is repaid on a monthly basis, she will purchase new home furniture and that will allow her family to live in better conditions. Nada is a conservative woman so her husband is photographed instead in the FATEN branch.\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

He is a person who can talk very comfortably when we comment on his history of success. He was excited knowing we would take the picture. This is why he gave us the interview. \r\n\r\nHe tells us that he is 37 years old and lives in a Mazahua community called San Agust\u00edn Mextepec. He has been married to Guadalupe for 16 years, and together they have 3 children who attend school. Ismael has a shoe store. From the time he was a child, he knew how to sell shoes, since his parents were the founders of the business and of the market where they sell the shoes. Now he has his own business. Although it comes from his parents, Ismael is the one who tends to it and is in charge of it. Ismael is asking for the loan in order to purchase more shoes such as boots, tennis shoes, high heels, sandals, etc. for women, men, girls, and boys. \r\n\r\nHe tells us that the loan will help him a lot since he will be able to invest more in his business and more than anything, the good seasons are coming and he will not have to worry about buying merchandise for a long time. Nevertheless, the difficulty he faces is that many times he doesn't sell and due to lack of money, he cannot invest more in his business.  He also recently got through his wife's illness. He also says that he likes the countryside a lot and had sheep and a field of cactus, although he sold the sheep to cover the costs resulting from the illness of his wife. \r\n\r\nBut Ismael is a very hard-working and responsible person and he has goals, such as to put everything into his shoe business.  He remembers that his shoe sales were once very good, and he would like to sell like before in order to improve the quality of life for his children and wife. He thinks that due to lack of money he will not be able to raise himself up, but he will do everything possible to get himself ahead again. He is a very hard-working family man, and he is very grateful to FRAC and Kiva for the support they give him, and he hopes it does not turn out badly.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1105850,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase shoes, boots, and tennis shoes for men and women","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"San Agustin San Felipe del Progreso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ismael ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-10-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":1349.15},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1380.63},{"due_date":"2012-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":1412.84},{"due_date":"2012-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1445.81},{"due_date":"2012-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1479.55},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1514.07},{"due_date":"2013-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1549.4},{"due_date":"2013-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":1585.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":1622.55},{"due_date":"2013-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":1660.45}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.68},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.15},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":110.68},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.25},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.9},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.6},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.37},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.2},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":127.1},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christina Mellace","image":1213464}},{"id":549632,"name":"Mwanasiti","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mwanasiti aged 40 years, is married and has been blessed with one child who has completed schooling.

He is married and has 3 children.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\nHe was forced to flee from northern Uganda to central Uganda due to Joseph Kony's rebel activities in his district.

His loan request was for building a family house in Acholi Quarters on a plot the King of Buganda donated to the Acholi some years back. He did not actually use that loan to build a house in Acholi Quarters, but in his home district of Pader, since the situation in the north is not as alarming as it used to be.

Most recently, she has begun selling rice, sugar, and flour, which have turned out to be her most popular items. She also has a large basket of kumquats, which she grows and picks in her own garden.

Huancavelica is considered one of the poorest regions of Peru and has many limitations, being a very mountainous area (the altituD. ranges from 6,000 to 17,000 feet above sea level), the cold, the difficulty of growing crops and the lack of an adequate infrastructure of roads and communication systems.\r\n<p>\r\nBCR Virgen D. las Mercedes has its base in the capital of  the province of Churcampa, which is located at over 10,000 feet above sea level. Currently the bank has completed 2 loan cycles in just one year of existence with 17 female borrowers. Some of the group members live in small communities outsiD. the city of Churcampa, in places like El Carmen and Chupas, more than an hour of walking distance away.\r\n<p>\r\nThe members of the bank, during their one year in FINCA Peru, besides having learned to be responsible and punctual, are learning more and more about savings and how to invest their loans. The group was able to save over 5,500 soles (about $1,800) in the first 2 loan cycles and will continue to save in the future.  For all members, the main use of the savings is for the education of their children: buying school uniforms, supplies, books and even to pay for entering primary or secondary school.  Another dream they have for the use of their savings is to be able to make renovations to their houses, like constructing another floor or changing the roof to a more sustainable one.\r\n<p>\r\nAll members have different enterprises, ranging from raising guinea pigs, having a kiosk with sweets and juices close to the primary school, selling food and ice creams, buying and selling small animals, selling potatoes, selling chicken or having grocery stores.\r\n<p>\r\nEvery member has a different testimony, as is the case of 36-year-old Mary O. C., who has a small grocery store in the central square of Churcampa, where she also sells homemaD. sweets. As with many women, she has more than one occupation: she also buys and sells chicken. The chicken she buys in a major city that is more than 8 hours away by public transport. Her dream is to grow her business and keep on saving to be able to pay for the education of her 3 children. Her new loan she will use for buying more groceries for her store.\r\n<p>\r\nAnother story is the one of Edith A. G., who has a grocery store and buys and sells small animals like sheep and lamb. Those are the businesses she runs during the whole year, but living in a rural area, she also has fields of corn and is waiting for the harvest in May to be able to sell her corn. Her new loan she will invest in buying more small animals.\r\n<p>\r\nAs the women of the group have different businesses, different businesses require different loans. The loans range from 200 soles, 400 soles, and 600 soles up to 1200 soles, and the total of the loans reaches 8,900 soles among the 17 members."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3025,"image":{"id":116625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"As the women of the group have different businesses, different businesses require different loans.

Moreover with the tight economic condition deteriorating and her 2 children still young made Ayu Putu decide to be diligent in pig farming which has been a family tradition since generations.  Her husband\u2019s income as a farmer is felt to be not sufficient to provide for the family\u2019s expenses.  With the motivation to assist her husband Ayu Putu decided to borrow from DINARI through the KIVA program to increase her capital to fund her pig farming.  With the initial loan 4 breeding pigs Ayu once again purchase 5 pigs with the loan from DINARI.  Coincidentally, Ayu\u2019s pig pen are adequately permanent adequate to accommodate many pigs.  Ayu is very serious in the pig farming because income from the sale is large.  After 5 months of breeding usually result in income of Rp.500.000,- (about USD 54) each month.  This will definitely aid fulfilling the family\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Indonesian to English by Pheng Tan, Kiva volunteer.<\/b> <p>\r\n\r\nMeski masih berusia muda untuk seorang ibu rumah tangga, tidak membuat Ayu Putu bersantai-santai dengan kehidupannya. Apalagi dengan himpitan ekonomi yang semakin berat dan ditambah harus menghidupi kedua anaknya yang masih kecil-kecil membuat Ayu Putu memutuskan untuk menekuni usahanya sebagai peternak babi yang memang sudah digeluti oleh keluarganya secara turun temurun. Penghasilan suaminya yang seorang petani dirasa masih belum cukup memenuhi kebutuhan keluarganya. Dengan motivasi membantu suaminya inilah Ayu Putu memutuskan untuk meminjam ke DINARI melalui program KIVA sehingga modalnya akan bertambah untuk usaha ternak babinya. Dengan modal awal 4 ekor babi penggemukan Ayu kembali membeli 5 ekor lagi dengan menggunakan modal dari DINARI. Kebetulan kandang babi Ayu sudah cukup permanen sehingga mampu menampung banyak babi. Ayu memang sangat serius menekuni usaha ternak babinya karena keuntungan yang didapat cukup besar dari hasil penjualannya. Selama 5 bulan pemeliharaan nantinya diharapkan bisa mendatangkan keuntungan sebesar Rp. 500.000,- setiap bulannya. Tentunya hal ini akan sangat membantu memenuhi kebutuhan keluarganya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":191395,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase piglets and supplies (Membeli anak babi dan pakannya)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-08-18T12:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Ayu Putu Astiti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-01T18:11:45Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":5000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":833333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":92,"local_amount":836363.64,"processed_date":"2008-10-08T01:53:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-29T07:08:49Z","rounded_local_amount":849097.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":351701},{"amount":91.33,"local_amount":830303.02,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-19T20:05:09Z","rounded_local_amount":842944.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308542},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":1666666.66,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:40:35Z","rounded_local_amount":1692041.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849765},{"amount":183.34,"local_amount":1666666.68,"processed_date":"2009-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:44:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1692041.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27080602}],"funded_date":"2008-08-18T18:11:45Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T17:44:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":64871,"name":"Maria Fabiola","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Maria Fabiola V., tiene 31 a\u00f1os de edad, es madre soltera tiene un hijo de 8 a\u00f1os de edad que cursa el tercer grado de primaria, no tiene ayuda economica del papa de su hijo, la actividad economica de la s\u00f1ora es la comecializacion de cosmeticos como perfumes para hombres y mujeres y ropa variada como pantalones, blusas trajes, actividad que tiene seis a\u00f1os  de desarrollar la cual da inicio como una alternativa al desempleo y aprovechando el apoyo de un familiar en el exterior ha ido creciendo poco a poco en capital, siendo su sue\u00f1o poder instalar un tiene de ropa para ni\u00f1os y adultos, y su proposito poder satisfacer la demanda, y darle un mejor porvenir a su hijo.","en":"Mrs. Maria Fabiola V., is 31 years of age, is a single mother of an 8 year old child who attends the third grade.

He raises and sells cattle because in that area there is hardly any other work for either men or women.  His wife is a housewife.  She manages the home and looks after the children.  One son is a migrant worker who works in Russia. Abdullo's daughter-in-law lives with them and cares for their grandchild.  Their family is large, 14 people who all live in the same house.  They would like to set up separate households, and therefore must increase the size of their herd in order to be able to divide it amongst the sons.

","en":"Delphine F. was born in 1978 in Cotonou, Benin's economic capital.  Delphine is married to Robert Gbetchou and the mother of four school-aged children. Delphine and her husband and children have been living in the Agbato quarter of Cotonou for the last five years. She helps her husband meet their family's needs with the income generated from her business. Delphine never attended school.

Her business involves designing handbags and shoes that she then has made and promotes through her specialized catalog.  \r\n\r\nIt has been 2 years since she entered into the arena that she prepared for, and started her own line of sandals and shoes.  She currently distributes these in the city of Barranquilla, in the Atl\u00e1ntico department, Valledupar, and the Codazzi municipality in the Cesar department.  This is how, with the help of trusted family and friends, she traveled to Bogot\u00e1 in September of 2009 to live with her sister.  Since that instance, she started selling bags and shoes by catalog from her own line called \u201cLinA.\u201d, with good results.  Her business includes the design, distribution and sale of footwear.  Currently, she is requesting her first loan through the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation, as she would like greater access to her markets.  She needs to buy a greater quantity of raw materials, especially leather, in order to make the handbags and shoes in her new collection.  \r\n\r\nLina is a young woman who dreams of growing as a professional and entrepreneur in order to help her family.  In addition, she would like to have her own workshop and shoe stores staffed by employees.

She earns her living buying and selling fresh\/dried fish. Her husband Julius, who is 33 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living. They have two children who are 8 and 9 years old. Rowena joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rowena has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 23,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to continue to save up for future expansion of her business and to send her children to school. Rowena is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Before joining One Acre Fund, David was only able to harvest 3 \u00bd bags of maize on \u00bd acre of land.\r\n\r\nWith this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to David and his group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from his maize sales, David will educate his children and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Wekhoyela group will each plant maize plots between \u00bd and 1 acre of land.\r\n\r\nDavid and the group members appear in the photograph as shown. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":925019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To source farming inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, at low prices for the 2012 planting season.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Chwele","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":202,"posted_date":"2011-11-24T04:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bonface","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Geofrey","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"George","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Martin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maurice ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josephine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":62650,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62650}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":62650,"processed_date":"2012-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":63770,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315680929}],"funded_date":"2011-11-24T21:53:18Z","paid_date":"2012-11-27T10:16:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":364874,"name":"Rino","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rino is 29 years old and lives in the town of Trinidad, Bohol.
