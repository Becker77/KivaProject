Malgr\u00e9 son ardeur et sa bonne foi, elle est limit\u00e9e par les moyens. Elle d\u00e9cide alors de solliciter un appui financier pour \u00e9largir son commerce. Le cr\u00e9dit de $550 qu\u2019elle demande va donc servir de fonds de commerce pour l\u2019achat des produits divers afin d\u2019agrandir son \u00e9talage. Son exp\u00e9rience est un bon atout pour rentabiliser ses activit\u00e9s et d\u00e9gager un revenu substantiel pour les besoins sa famille.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285229,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy vitambaa (material), vitenge (a traditional Tanzanian cloth with wax print), and kanga (printed cotton fabric often with a border along all four sides)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T20:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pendo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027592},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613593},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010672},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:12Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232958},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:20Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664749}],"funded_date":"2009-03-09T23:34:26Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":98057,"name":"Awa","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Madame Awa S. a pour l\u2019activit\u00e9 la vente de savon et le savon en poudre pour faire la lessive.

He received training from our organization and has also invested in farming and pig rearing. \r\n\r\nComing back to our organization, P. is looking for a loan to be able to start a firewood selling business. In this area, it is very common for people to use fires rather than stoves for their cooking, and P. sees that there is much need for greater access to this resource. That being the case, P. is looking to buy a hammer, chisel, axe and wood to be able to distribute his firewood throughout the community. \r\n\r\nWith his past loan activity, P. invested the gains in educating his children, improving his home, buying piglets for his farm, and for trading in his community. This next loan will also be used for some of the same purposes. P. would like to continue his children\u2019s education and ensure their good health, and he would also like continue improving his home, being able to plaster the walls of his house. He is sure that this business will succeed because of the large market demand and because of his ability to sell the wood at a reasonable price.\r\n\r\nP. originally came to GHAPE because of the reasonable rates on the loans and also because of what he has gotten out of them. He has learned how to manage his money, how to run a profitable farm, and has also learned about how to educate his children.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":363356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of hammer, chisel, axe, firewood, transport of materials ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Alabukam, Mankon, NW.

Since she was 20 years old she started her business. She learned the business from her mother since she was a young girl when she lived in the city of Soledad, another municipality near Barranquilla. When she moved of Malambo she started her business there. She started out by selling shoes, clothing and other merchandise and the business was overseen by her mother. Later she learned to make crafts out of crafters foam, wood, porcelain and using  other media and she decided to start selling. The pilot project was successful but she didn't have enough capital to fill the orders she received so she sought out Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner) for their support. She accessed her first loan in the amount of 1.200.000 COP and with it she purchased a variety of products, including clothing, shoes and ladies' accessories. She had enough money to purchase materials to make her beautiful crafts.  \r\nThis is how she managed to supplement her working capital and to make herself independent from her mother. \r\n\r\nThanks to her business she has been able to cover the house hold expenses and her children's education costs; she was able to contribute with her husband to the family's support. This loan is the second she requests and with it she will purchase sheets of crafters' foam, sewing materials, shoes, paints, and clothing. She will endeavor to take advantage of the holiday season at the end of the year when the sales are the highest. Every family enjoys decorating their homes, in preparation for Christmas. Equally they prepare themselves for New Year's Day.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva

She is 52, married to a surveyor, and they have 5 sons and daughters: Leonardo, 32 who is an engineer, Juan Carlos, 31 who is in information technology, Dulce Mar\u00eda, 30, who is in public relations, Israel, 26, who is an economist, and Rodolfo, 15, who is studying in the CBTIS of Ciudad Ayala.  Ver\u00f3nica finished basic education and studied to be an executive secretary.  She will use her loan to supply her business. She is going to buy patented pharmaceuticals.  She began with KIVA loans and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad through the invitation of a friend. She has a pharmacy in her neighborhood, and she also sells patented pharmaceuticals, perfumes, baby clothes and gifts.  Her business is called Farmacia (Pharmacy) Mega and she has had  it for 15 years.  Previously she worked in a pharmacy in Cuautla.  People who knew her suggested that she open a pharmacy in her area until finally, with the help of her sister, they established the first one.  Between the two of them they handled the business and then she helped her sister open one for herself.\r\nThey also had a restaurant in the area but they closed it because they couldn\u2019t find people who knew about the business.\r\nShe rents a store that is 200 meters from her house and every day she walks over to her business.  She considers her business very important because she gets to meet and talk with many people, it serves as a distraction, and she earns money.  What she most likes about it are the sales.  From the time she was little she sold from her mother\u2019s house.  It was a big lot and there were many fruit trees.  She would gather the fruit  from the trees in a basket and go out to sell, and then she would give the money that she made to her mother so that she would buy something delicious to eat.  When she was 14 she was buying soft drinks and selling them outside of her mother\u2019s house.  Later \u201cI went to Jalsico and began to buy blankets, sheets, cushions, and napkins that I could purchase very cheaply and I would make good money when I went to Zapata park in Cuautla  to sell the merchandise\u201c.  \r\nShe has always liked sales. She gets a lot of pleasure from her work because she can buy what she likes and she is proud to say that it has moved her sons and daughters ahead and helped them study for careers in the university.  Her regular customers are her own neighbors.  On the average she sees about 20 to 30 people  of all ages every day.  Her customers buy from her because they know she treats them well and that is why her business is known throughout the area.  Now there are two other pharmacies that have opened there  but they don\u2019t really affect her business.  She uses the money that she makes mostly in keeping up her medicine supply, to pay the rent, and to pay an employee. She will use the KIVA loan to buy patented pharmaceuticals and to purchase a showcase for the stuffed animals that she sells for gifts.  She has her plans and hopes to builf her own pharmacy so that she won\u2019t have to pay rent any more. The best will be that her youngest son continues studying and have a career.  She feels happy with the loan because it will supply her business.  Some of her words for the KIVA team are \u201cI appreciate that you help us with the loan to improve the business.  The town of Moyotepec likes it because the business started here and grew here. Moyotepec has a hot climate, they grow sugar cane, beans, onions, and corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":681942,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To buy patented pharmaceuticals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Moyotepec, Ayala, Morelos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-01-04T02:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Veronica ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":750},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":187.5,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:44:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2319.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191430790},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":1546.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195850048},{"amount":125,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:10:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1546.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201292321},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":750,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:47Z","rounded_local_amount":773.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206160586}],"funded_date":"2011-01-04T04:34:50Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:08:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":266894,"name":"Rebeca Del Socorro","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Rebeca tiene muchas ganas de salir adelante con su familia.

When Sabah takes the loan, which will be repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to pay for making repairs to her house and live in better conditions with her family. Sabah is a conservative religious woman, so her husband is photographed instead.

Now she is applying for a loan to repair her husband\u2019s vehicle so that he will be able to continue his work. <P>\r\n\r\nShe is joined in her loan by several more women from her locality. Rehana baji and Sakina baji each want a loan to buy an auto-rickshaw (a local three-wheeled motor vehicle). Khursheed baji wants a loan to pay the installments on her auto-rickshaw. Shamim baji wants a loan to buy a buffalo for her milk-selling business. <P>\r\n\r\nThis is a group loan. The loan funds will be distributed among the group members, each of whom will invest in her own business. The members mutually guarantee one another's loans. If one member does not repay, the other members are responsible.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":261534,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To

Nasiba says that this is the perfect time for her to take out a loan. By offering a better selection, she knows she will be able to capitalize on this opportunity. \r\n\r\nHer goal is to continue expanding and improving her business every day, and more importantly, ensure that her four children will always be able to attend a good school.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Using a part of this money, she invested in her business. But things didn't go well for her, and separating from her husband after having 3 children, she came to Barranquilla in 2006.  By 2008, having saved $1,300,000 Colombian pesos as capital, and with the help of Social Action, who provided seed capital of $1,400,00 pesos, she launched anew her little store in Barrio Concord, Municipality of Malambo. In 2009, she moved it to Barrio Las Moras, where things have gone very well for her store, the \u201cTienda la Luna\u201d.\r\n\r\nMaria wants to add a new show-case to her store, in order to begin selling miscellany. Also, she wishes to purchase cases of drinks, which are very profitable, especially on weekends and market days. She has approached the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation requesting a loan, since she already had  repaid this organization in a timely manner for 2 loans which were used for kitchen utensils (previously, she had made do with only the strictly necessary).\r\n\r\nMaria has 3 children, ages 12, 18, and 21, and lives in a rented house. But she dreams of having her own little house in the barrio where she has her market. She wishes to combine it with her miscellany store. \r\n\r\nLately she faces a great challenge which is not to sell at credit to everyone who requests it, but, rather, to select the customers she will finance very carefully, taking into account their capacity to pay. This will diminish the risk of losing what little money she has acquired through so much effort. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva

boy.  She has a secondary education and has been involved in agriculture for 12 years.  By nature, she is a woman with a very positive attitude.  She has four cows on her farm.  She and her children also grow barley on 1.4 hectares of their own land.  She also works as a cleaning lady in a school and she receives a pension for the loss of her husband.  The family's total monthly income amounts to 15,000 som (KGS), which is not enough for Nargul and her son to have a decent living.

Her store sells <i>kanga<\/i> and <i>vitenge,<\/i> which are traditional kinds of clothing worn by Tanzanian women. The <i>kanga<\/i> is a piece of printed cotton fabric, often with a border along all four sides. It is printed using the silkscreen method with its pattern in frames. <i>Kitenge<\/i> (the Swahili plural is <i>vitenge)<\/i> is a cotton fabric with wax print, printed by using rotary printing machines. <i>Kitenge<\/i> is a communicating textile: the various colors, patterns, writings and symbols represent moods, feelings, cultures, and traditions of native African people. \r\n<p>\r\nYuster works at her business eight hours a day, six days per week, and has one shop assistant.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets: thus, they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thereby enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285309,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To add more traditional African clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T21:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yuster","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:56Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027605},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613606},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010685},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:14Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232971},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:15Z","rounded_local_amount":104160,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664762}],"funded_date":"2009-03-09T22:23:22Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":98089,"name":"Fati","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Cette dame habite le quartier d\u2019agbal\u00e9p\u00e9do, elle est divorc\u00e9e de son mari et a 02 enfants, elle est tr\u00e8s dynamique et travaille dure pour subvenir au besoin de ses enfants, l\u2019activit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle exerce est la vente de chaussures, de pagnes, de sacs et de m\u00e8ches.

Her husband works in construction.\r\n\r\nTeresa sells food from her home, located 4 blocks from the center of town.  For 3 years, she has had a small restaurant called \u201cTeresita\u201d.  She sells lunch and snacks, and prepares a variety of dishes based on her customers\u2019 likes and the ingredients she has on hand.  Lunches generally consist of a soup and a main course, while afternoon snacks might be rice stews and roasted meat (chicken or beef).  She starts cooking in the morning, and customers begin to arrive for lunch at 11 am.  She finishes selling food at 9 or 9:30 at night.  Each day, she sells 20 lunches and 30 afternoon snacks.  She makes the food herself, but does have help from her son and another lady.\r\n\r\nTeresa is requesting this loan so she can buy sodas, ingredients, and ceramic ware to replace the one she is currently using (which is somewhat damaged), and also some decorations to improve the ambiance of her establishment.  \r\n\r\nShe tells us she has great ambitions for the future, for example, traveling to Spain to visit some of her relatives that are living there. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva

Fotu is a 66-year-old woman living in the town of Auala.  She is married and has fourteen grown children.  To make a living, Sophie owns and operates a business running a food stall.  Her main source of income from the business comes from selling beef products in the local community.  Sophie has been engaged in this business for over two years and earns approximately $160 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sophie joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities.  Sophie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 750 WST from SPBD.  That loan was used to purchase additional products to sell.  Sophie is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST, which will also be used to buy more products to sell.  This will be her second loan from SPBD.  Sophie plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\"\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":383914,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

The main source of income for the business comes from preparing and selling bananacue in the local community. Venus has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Venus joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Venus has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional products to sell. Venus is requesting a new loan of 8000 PHP which will again be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Venus from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This bank was set up in the community of Ingapirca, which is located 45 minutes outside the city of Cuenca.  Their community is the location of the famous archaeological ruins of Ingapirca, and is also known for its lush vegetation and unique scenery that attracts tourists from all parts of the country and the world.  The members of the community make a living through farming, though the young people have migrated to the city in search of better job opportunities and the chance to improve their economic and social situation.\r\n\r\nLigia Roxana B. is one of the youngest members of the communal bank.  She is 19 years old, is in a common-law marriage, and is the mother of a 2-year-old daughter.  Her husband works in construction, and together they built their own house, which Ligia is very proud of.\r\n\r\nLigia works as a domestic servant Mondays through Fridays from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.  She also makes a living raising chickens, which she sells either dressed or live to her neighbors in the community, and which she also uses for household consumption.\r\n\r\nThis is Ligia\u2019s second loan with the Espoir foundation.  She used her first loan to start her chicken farm, and will use the money from the current loan to purchase fencing material, which she will use to make an enclosure and increase the number of birds on her farm. \r\n\r\nLigia\u2019s goal is to keep working so that she can improve her economic situation and achieve a better quality of life for her whole family.\r\n\r\nLike Ligia, Tania wants to improve her situation and help her family.  She is 18 years old and is in a common-law marriage, and is raising a son who is only nine months old.  Her husband works in construction applying stucco and primarily works on ceilings.  She and her family do not have their own home, but instead live in the house of Tania\u2019s in-laws.  Tania makes a living looking after children in a daycare center.  She has had this job for one year, and works from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\r\n\r\nTania is grateful to her sister-in-law for inviting her to join La Inmaculada communal bank.  The group is made up of cheerful men and women who are all fighters, and who are looking after the welfare of their families.  She is now in her second loan cycle, and will use the money from this loan to purchase chickens and to purchase vitamins and feed so that she can start a chicken-raising business.\r\n\r\nTania\u2019s

She owns a business venture, providing dress making services to local community members.  Saisii has 3 years of experience in this business.  Saisii needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 240 talas or US $100 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2007, Saisii joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Saisii's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nAbout SPBD\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

What she wants most is to live a tranquil life in her later years.\r\n\r\nCarmela\u2019s work is the cultivation of cacao, coffee, and coca. Every day, she works in her fields, as she knows that the profit she makes on her products depends on the quality of the harvest. She sells her products in the city of San Francisco, where the prices are the best. What she enjoys most about her work is harvesting her fields; at this time, she feels that the months of work have borne fruit. \r\n\r\nCarmela has done this work for 40 years and finds the most difficult part is fumigating the fields, as there is always the risk of sickness from the chemicals. For the future, she hopes to improve her harvests, to obtain more income.\r\n\r\nThis is Camela\u2019s second loan with MFP, and she says that this support will help her very much in progressing with her work. In her communal bank, she is very loved by the other members, as she is very connected with them. The 1000 soles from this loan will be used to invest in products that will help protect the plants from insects.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":636835,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy insecticides for fields.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-11-10T14:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1047.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195698}],"funded_date":"2010-11-10T16:19:51Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"jeff hersk","image":384019}},{"id":250541,"name":"Shakeela's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shakeela is a very talented woman, operating her clothing sales business to share the financial burden with her husband.

The majority of them live in Puente Piedra, a district to the north of Lima that is characterized by its hard-working and enterprising people.  \r\n\r\nSenor Roque is a good example since he spends most of his time working in his bakery and pastry shop.  Here he prepares all types of pastries that he sells to the customers that he has earned over time.  The bakery has good times.   For example, for parties he prepares panetones [a type of sweet bread] and turrones [a traditional Peruvian dessert] which bring in a decent income.  During the low season he works in urban transportation because with his savings he was able to buy a combi (microbus).

She is married to Redimundo, an employee, and mother to their five children. She, together with her husband, manages their own household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nRosita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. Rosita earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. She also sells breakfast meals in the morning like hotdogs and eggs with buns.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php 8,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, beverages and other products to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nRosita hopes to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week and  draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and repay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":851968,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to pay for grocery items and products needed in her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-08-22T18:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":1599.99,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":1697.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227005425},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2133.01,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:35:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2263.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232764593},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.96,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2830.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238571714},{"amount":40,"local_amount":1600.04,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1698.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244529264}],"funded_date":"2011-08-22T20:54:47Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T09:31:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":332502,"name":"Mario Ricardo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mario,vive con su madre y hermanos, \u00e9l es empleado trabaja como profesor del centro escolar de un lugar cercano a donde vive, esta desde hace 8 a\u00f1os trabajando de lunes a viernes, adem\u00e1s administra un taller de bicicletas.\n\u00c9l inicio la construcci\u00f3n de un cuarto hace varios meses, con la ayuda de un pr\u00e9stamo, actualmente recurre a esta ayuda para poder terminar la construcci\u00f3n, afinando detalles en la habitaci\u00f3n, por lo que pagara m\u00e1s mano de obra, comprara cemento , arena y ladrillo de piso.\nSu objetivo es aprovechar los pr\u00e9stamos, que mientras mantenga su trabajo podr\u00e1 cancelar las cuotas oportunamente, con esto quiere tener una vivienda digna y c\u00f3moda para su familia.\n","en":"Mario lives with his mother and siblings.

The first activity generates more income and although she started it after she became a manicurist she took advantage of the opportunity to build her clientele for meat products and assorted merchandise.  When she began with her entrepreneurial idea, she took courses ten years ago to become a manicurist.  She gained experience working as an employee in a beauty salon for two years and then became independent earning profits that she invested in merchandise which led to her going into the cold cuts business once she had an established clientele of her own.\r\n\r\nYady covers family expenses with her businesses.  Her family consists of her spouse and three children whose ages range from 5 to 11 years.  She provides the manicure services primarily in customers\u2019 homes.

She has to go two or three times a week to the country to buy her merchandise and bring it back for resale to the city. Her business becomes more and more difficult during the rainy season because of the bad condition of the roads, especially in the backwoods. <P>\r\n\r\nIn January 2008, Elise decided to join one of the groups of Hope RDC in view of finding permanent financial support which will allow her to realize her dream of one day opening a general store. She is a faithful client who has received several loans from Hope, which she has reimbursed completely and on time. <P>\r\n\r\nThe most recent loan which she has received this month of June permitted her to diversify her business by buying sacks of dried beans, onions, vegetable oil, and salted fish to re-sell in order to increase her profit. She has a working capital of US$ 130 and her business brings in a profit of US$ 40 per week which helps her pay the school fees for her children. She  sells her wares in a mountainous zone in the south-west of Kinshasa. Elise is 45, married, and the mother of 4 children, aged between 13 and 19.

Rosario P. has been with the community bank for three loan cycles. She lives in the El Cruce area of the Sinincay parish located north-east of the canton of Cuenca. The parish of Chiguintad lies to the north, to the east and south is the city of Cuenca, and to the west is the parish of Sayaus\u00ed. The artisans of Sinincay specialize in the production of marble and the manufacture of tiles and bricks. Some of the women make hats from toquilla fiber. The parish church is renowned for its architectural beauty and its picture of the Visitation of the Virgin. The church is the parish\u2019s most important attraction and is frequently visited by tourists.\n\nBank member Rosario is 53 years old, married, and has eight children. The four oldest have jobs and help their mother financially; the four youngest attend high school or primary school. Rosario tells us that she is also responsible for her three nephews and nieces as her sister has gone overseas to bring them a better standard of living. With her and her husband\u2019s hard work, they managed to build their own home.\n\nAs well as all her household chores, Sra. Rosario raises animals such as cows, sheep, and guinea pigs mostly for her family\u2019s consumption but sometimes she sells them out of necessity. She is going to use the loan to buy a soldering machine as her son needs one for the body shop that he owns. Her greatest wish is to remain healthy so she can help her children achieve whatever is within their reach.\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":548194,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Metal Shop","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To buy a soldering machine","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-06-16T15:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:00Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892546},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:51Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632892},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":110,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:13Z","rounded_local_amount":112.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846926},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:04Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113387},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:05Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406972},{"amount":56.25,"local_amount":55,"processed_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:58Z","rounded_local_amount":56.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177406973}],"funded_date":"2010-06-16T18:17:18Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":209575,"name":"Sopheap","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sopheap C.

Since then, her business has been performing well and earning her sufficient profit. \r\n\r\nMedina needs working capital to help boost her business to earn increased profits. She is requesting her new loan of 20,000 PHP as additional capital for her variety store, to be used to pay for groceries for her enterprise. \r\n\r\nMedina is optimistic that she can achieve her dreams of providing a good life for her family and being able to bring them to into a decent way of life.

He lives with his wife and their two children, ages 10 and 15, in the town of  Soledad, 10 minutes from the city of Barranquilla. There he runs a store called \u201cEl Ni\u00f1o Rey\u201d [The Child King], which he started in 2005 and has expanded through hard work. He started with a vacant property and in three years, using his own work and savings, he made it into a store. He started out renting the property but eventually bought it.\r\n\r\nGregorio finds his work very satisfying, because after making sacrifices to start his store he has managed to keep it very prosperous. His daily sales come to between $600 and $700. He can put about 15% of that amount towards offsetting his fixed costs, and he keeps a good level of inventory. He would like to expand his business to include the sale of cold drinks, buying them wholesale and then selling them to potential clients such as small stores, restaurant owners, and soft drink stands. These clients typically cannot buy in large quantities and so when they run out of provisions they have to wait to put in an order, and the delays in distribution cause them to lose business. Gregorio hopes to be able to sell drinks to these clients directly from his store, thus providing them with faster service.

Some neighbors invited her to join a group, and now 20 members are having loans and doing business like selling shoes, clothing, cosmetics, and many other small businesses.\r\n\r\nIsabel plans to use this loan to invest in her business by purchasing gum, lollipops, snacks (chips), and others. She has had her business for almost two years, starting after the first loan she received from Esperanza. She is excited to be taking out her third loan with Esperanza after having successfully repaid her previous loan and expanded her business. She will save her profits to reinvest in her business. \r\n\r\nShe makes her home here in a simple house with her long-time partner and their two children.

He owns his own home.  Since he was a child, he has dedicated himself to farming.  In addition, he has always raised livestock such as cows and bulls to help him plow his fields so he can plant in large quantities.  Currently, he has planted three sacks of pea seeds.  Eusebio prefers to plant a seed called \u201cSuper-Improved\u201d which is more resistant than other varieties of seed.  During planting season he yields 4 or 5 stalks per hill which is very favorable, having fertilized well first, of course.  Likewise, he has planted 60 sacks of potato seed.  These potatoes are not for consumption, and are instead destined to become seed which is more profitable for Eusebio.  He also tells us that it is profitable to invest in the purchase of large livestock.  With his first loan from MFP, he bought a cow and he now has its offspring.  Eusebio has received a loan with MFP four times, and the entire time he has not had a problem paying his installments on the designated date.  He promises to continue paying this loan on time as well.  The funds he requests are for the purchase of three bags of pea seeds, each bag costing 600.00 Peruvian soles.  The remainder of the funds will be invested into insecticides to fumigate his crops.     <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":261601,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase seeds and insecticides.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-26T18:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eusebio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":162.5,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:45:10Z","rounded_local_amount":517.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989721},{"amount":487.5,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1552.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210857}],"funded_date":"2009-01-26T20:37:50Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":89929,"name":"Millicent","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Millicent A. is 34 years old.

She is the mother of three children, is a housewife, and is a selfless wife, who works with her husband. She and her husband have a bakery located in the center of the city of Jipijapa in the province of Manab\u00ed, and they start working very early in the morning, at 3:00 am.\r\n\r\nEveryday, they start baking 400 loaves of salty and sweet bread. Once the bread is out of the oven at 5:00 am, her husband begins delivering bread to the houses of their clients to fill their orders. Without a doubt, this is work that requires a lot of dedication because their goal is to sell all of the bread that is produced that day. What is not sold during the day is shared with their family because one of the rules for these bakeries is that the next day, the flour must the fresh. They have never sold day-old bread, since doing this would harm their business.\r\n\r\nMartha thinks that in the four years that they have had this business, their family has gotten many benefits, because they have been able to work together as a family. She also said that with their work, they have been able to offer an education to their children.

despite the adversities of life.  They are partners in solidarity who always have a positive attitude; they radiate happiness in the bi-monthly meetings where they share their everyday experiences.  They live in different areas in the City of Cuenca.   Se\u00f1ora M\u00f3nica M. lives in the Carmen sector of Sinincay, located 45 minutes outside the outskirts of the City of Cuenca.

Her older son is studying in the Francisco D\u00e1vila school where he has completed his second  year of basic education.  Her husband works as a taxi driver in a local cooperative.  They do not yet have a house of their own; they live in a rented house owned by a relative.\r\n\r\nMonica has worked in her beauty parlor for 7 years.  The premises are leased.  She tells us that there are good days and bad days, but one must give thanks to God for everything He provides to us.  Her many years of experience have enabled her to develop her clientele.  She also told us that thanks to her work she is able to obtain money on a daily basis to help with the household expenses and pay the rent on her parlor.  She works from 8am to 8pm from Monday to Saturday each week.  This is her sixth cycle with the communal bank.  She is very grateful to the foundation because it has allowed her to improve her business, to associate with other women to help generate their incomes, and, most importantly, to cultivate good friendships with all of the members of her bank.  With this loan that the ESPOIR foundation is giving her, she is going to purchase products such as: permanent solution, hair dyes, nail enamel, beauty treatments, etc., in order to improve her business and provide quality service.  Monica's biggest dream is to have her own house, where she could put up her own beauty parlor.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":392723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to buy beauty products such as permanent solution, hair dyes, nail enamels, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Monica Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":330,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":134.05,"local_amount":126.39,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:32:36Z","rounded_local_amount":134.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96947485},{"amount":138.76,"local_amount":130.83,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:31:04Z","rounded_local_amount":138.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103789340},{"amount":33.44,"local_amount":31.53,"processed_date":"2009-12-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:28:32Z","rounded_local_amount":33.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110679770},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":41.25,"processed_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:19Z","rounded_local_amount":43.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118074359}],"funded_date":"2009-10-03T09:12:01Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:33:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":143254,"name":"Marcos","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marcos is 50 years old and he is married to Myrna M., and they have six children.

For 12 years he has worked in agriculture growing potatoes, olluco (an Andean root vegetable), beans and vegetables such as carrots, onions and peas.  His wife is his main support when he completes his diverse tasks in the field.  He also raises cattle in a small cattle shed that he built next to his house.  In addition, he sells the products that he harvests in a market in the city of Aleda\u00f1a; in this way he is able to see the fruits of his labor.  Over the years he has strengthened the economic situation of his household, and this is the reason why he wishes to increase his crops and acquire more animals.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures, charcoal sales and banana sales. Her husband Romeo, age 59, works as a laborer and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have seven children who are 20 to 35 years old. \r\n\r\nElisa joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Elisa has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 25,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000 which she intends to use to purchase more bananas so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her granddaughter and to sustain her family's daily needs. Elisa B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Tajikistan has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Today Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

The group's name is in the Mixtecan language and means \u201cThe stream (river) of the grandparents\u201d.  'YUTA' means 'stream (river)' and 'CHI' means 'grandparent'.  They decided to give the group this name since the town of Yutachi is near the group's meeting point, and also to honor of their ancestors.  There are 11 people in the group, together with their representative who is called Anastacia N. M..\r\n\r\nOn this occasion we will talk about Mrs Esther Leonor Ba\u00f1os J. who is a member of this group.  She is 46 years old and married.  Her husband is called Lorenzo and he is 50 years old.  He works as a belt maker and as an agricultural worker.  They have been married for 22 years and have had 4 children.  Three of their children are still alive.  Josefina(+), who was their third child, died from health complications and lack of specialized medical care.  This was a result of the poverty and inequality of society.  Their remaining children are Alejandro, 21; Felipe, 19 and Joel who is 11 and is pursuing his secondary education.  Esther only studied at elementary level.\r\n\r\nEsther used the loan which they were awarded to acquire material to use for making her hand-made embroideries.  She makes handbags, wallets, blouses, napkins and tablecloths using a number of different stitches such as cross-stitch, 'trenza margarita', 'pato de gallo', rococo, star, chain, the complicated technique of openwork in cross stitch and the embroidery of blouses with seedglass beads.  Among the long list of materials which she uses for this beautiful work are the following: Panama linen, cotton skirting, tergal (a synthetic fibre containing polyester),  hand-spun cotton, different threads such as cotton thread, worsted for embroideries and 'iris vela' thread, all in different colors, stitch unpickers, seedglass beads, embroidery hoops and different sized needles.  She started her business more than four years ago owing to her own need for financial improvement.\r\n\r\nEsther's biggest dream is to gather together a large number of people who live in conditions of extreme poverty, to teach them everything that she knows without distinction of sex or creed.  She would like to promote self employment for the most vulnerable who are women and indigenous people.  Another of her goals is for other people to find out about her crafts and promote them so that she can make more profits and, in this way, help her project grow as well as provide support for her children's education.\r\n\r\nEsther is currently working hard on training more people to work through a social office called ICAPET as well as the governmental program for indigenous people called CDI.  This shows that despite the great inequality of society, there are still people who dream, who are doing something and that their great commitment is their love towards other people.\r\n\r\nShe tells us to speak with these words, \u201cI am grateful to Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad for trusting in the poor, for helping to free us from these chains which bind us called poverty and for believing in an abandoned sector of society who nobody turns to see.  Thank you for everything and God bless you forever\u201d.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the members of this group and their business activities:\r\n\r\nSalustia T.

She is married to Jumar, 34, a timekeeper. She is also the mother of one child who is now in grade IV. While attending to her husband and child, she also keeps herself busy with her business as her way of helping her husband pay for the family's daily expenses. \r\n\r\nJiael is a bayong maker. Bayong is a native bag in the Philippines made of rubberized plastic and hand woven. Jiael makes different sized bags depending on the request of clients in the market and malls. She also creates different designs such as square, triangle, and oblong. She earns a minimum of 200 PHP in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a 14,000 PHP loan. She will utilize the loan to buy more raw materials. With the Christmas season fast approaching, her numerous customers will place many orders for bayong to be used as fruit trays and vanity kits. \r\n  \r\nJiael hopes that her business will continue to generate an income that will provide for the needs of her family. She dreams that she can continue making bayong and attending to her family needs at the same time. She hopes that her family will remain simple and happy.
