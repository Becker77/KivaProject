old, with the youngest still going to school. The D. family lives in the village of Brgy, Rizal, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. Some of her children worked so that they could help shoulder the family's expenses. As her children grew older, the family expenses also increased, and it became obvious that her husband's income would not be able to sustain the family's increasing needs. This situation made her decide to start her own business to augment the family income. \n\nLeonila started a small food vending business in her local community. She sells \"bananacue\" and \"camotecue' - made by frying whole bananas and sliced sweet potatoes, then adding brown sugar into the oil once the banana or sweet potato is cooked, and caramelizing the sugar until it coats the banana or sweet potato. It is called \"bananacue\" and \"camotecue\" because they are sold skewered in bamboo barbecue sticks. She also sells \"Halo-halo\" - literally meaning mixed. \"Halo-halo\" is made with a mixture of candied fruit and jellies, scraped ice, milk and sugar. Corn Flakes and Leche Flan (Caramelized milk custard) are also added in many \"halo-halo\" recipes, and it can be topped with ice cream to make it more special. This is very popular during the hot summer months. She also sells ice candy made with frozen fruit juice or a frozen milk-based mixture.\n\nAside from her food vending business, Leonila also sells Ready-to-Wear clothes. She's been operating this business for thirty-seven years now and she continues to maintain a good relationship with her customers and maintains the good quality of her products. She earns about $88 a month from her business activities. The income covers some of the family income, provides the allowance of her youngest child who still goes to school, and the balance is reinvested into the business. \n\nLeonila has retained her good record with the Kiva field partner, NWTF-Project Dungganon. She paid off her thirteenth loan of PHP 19,500 on time, and it went a long way in providing her with a revolving working capital for her business. Now she is borrowing PHP 17,000 for her 14th cycle loan. She intends to use this loan to add to her working capital.\n\n\nAbout NWTF: \nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day, to surpassing the realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable. This is Project Dungganon. \n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":392272,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

They are all mothers and fathers, and are hard-working and entrepreneurial. They are involved in businesses like tinsmithing, blacksmithing, selling bread, chicken, cheese, food, perfume, appliances, and groceries, as well as providing services like teaching. The dedication of these people is high, since they depend on their businesses for daily income to sustain their families.\r\n<p>\r\nFor example, Olga sells hamburgers at the intersection of two avenues to proviD. for her two children. She is married, but given her husband's income, they don't have enough to pay for rent, basic services, and education for their children. That is why she delivers newspapers in the morning and sells hamburgers in the afternoon and evening, with the help of her small children.\r\n<p>\r\nThese loans will be used to buy ingredients, materials, and tools to improve their businesses and increase their incomes, so they can improve their homes and give their families a better quality of life. Although this is their first loan cycle, the members of this group already have experience with group loans and know that the group is necessary for them to have access to this economic support and they need to keep the trust of our institution. They have a strong desire to work and to get ahead, and they are united in this group.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Iverson, Kiva

He lives with his wife and child in the Massablacoura  neighborhood of Bougouni.  Not having attended a modern school, at a young age he embarked on activities that would generate an income, such as selling clothing. That business was not successful for him. Then, he decided to observe his uncle to learn about selling grocery items in a store. After more than two years of experience, Mr. Bourama Konat\u00e9 has mastered his business. In order to obtain a consistent working capital, he decided to affiliate with the Soro Yiriwaso loan program to buy a variety of grocery items for his store. This is his first loan with Soro Yiriwaso.  He gets his supplies in Bamako (capital of the republic of Mali) from wholesalers.  His customers come from the local population.  He expects to make a monthly profit of 40,000 CFA with this loan.  He wants to use the loan to expand his store. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Connie Archea, Kiva

He is married and has 8 children whose ages he does not remember; all the children go to school.  Carlos only finished second grade and did not continue because he had to help graze the family's cattle.  He lives in his own house with his family and supports his second wife, who lives in Gaza Province, by sending her some money for household expenses. \r\n\r\nCarlos left Gaza to move to Maputo looking for work, and he came alone.  He has worked for more than four years at an agricultural company as an agricultural operator.  He receives a salary of 1,690 meticais per month, which he uses for household expenses.  With the help of his wife, who runs a business, he is also able to save some money through Xitique (a traditional system of rotating savings).\r\n\r\nHe has never had loans from other banks.  Carlos learned about Hluvuku through co-workers who are also customers of this institution.  This is his first loan.  He is asking for 10,000 meticais to buy construction materials (cement, sand, stone, iron, and other items) to continue construction on his house.\r\n\r\nHis greatest dream is to finish building his house.  Carlos is confident he will pay off the loan ahead of time and ask for another loan.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":636073,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

very driven small business owner, Domenic purchased his laundromat in 2009 in order to seek business opportunities on his own terms. \r\n\r\nThe previous owner had focused more on taking money out of the business rather than reinvesting, leaving Domenic with some heavy work to accomplish. However, he successfully remodeled the building, replacing the floors and purchasing all new furniture. He has established a whole new feel to the business with music constantly playing and laptop accessibility for the busy Bostonian with a full service laundromat and dry cleaning service.\r\n\r\nHis day begins at 8 AM and isn\u2019t complete until 8 PM. And it is all done in the style of what Domenic calls \"a one man band.\" Domenic paid for all of the original remodeling of the laundromat out of pocket because a local bank declined to lend him money due to the size of his business. With this loan from ACCION USA, Domenic will be purchasing a new hot water heater to maintain the flow of business and increase his energy efficiency. His current hot water heater is 75 years old and incurs high energy costs as well as being much smaller then newer versions.\r\n\r\nEventually, Domenic wants to be able to purchase more stores and hire a team of employees to run his growing businesses. Watching his current business take root has inspired him to continue growing and continue to provide for the increasing number of his returning clients.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:\r\nAn estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education. Small businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities.

Ahora viven solos en su casa propia ubicada en el caser\u00edo de San Juan de la Libertad. La zona de San Juan, es conocida por sus buenas tierras de cultivo que en su mayor\u00eda son de papa. Por ese motivo el nombre de la asociaci\u00f3n es \u201cCapital semillera\u201d. Desde muy joven comenz\u00f3 con su oficio de agricultor, desde entonces sembr\u00f3 toda variedad de papa como: \u201cpericholi, canchan y yungay\u201d, todo depende de la temporada de cosecha y la calidad de sembr\u00edo.

En todo este tiempo logr\u00f3 obtener un cami\u00f3n con el que trasporta cargamento de frutas y verduras a todo el pa\u00eds, adem\u00e1s de visitar cada 6 meses la costa del pa\u00eds, donde comercializa la semilla que cosecha.

Thirty-three years ago he joined his life with Agustina, who has been his wife for eight years.  They have four children, and all of them are adults.  Now they live alone in their own house in the rural community of San Juan de la Libertad.  The San Juan zone is known for its good farmland upon which potatoes are mostly grown.  That is why the name of the association is \u201cCapital Semillera\u201d (Seed Money).\r\n\r\nHe started his occupation as a farmer when he was very young.  From then on he has planted all types of potatoes like \u201cpericholi\u201d (a white potato that is sweet and full of water), \u201ccanchan\u201d (has a pink, thin skin; the meat is of a pale whitish color), and \"yungay\" (round white potato good for boiling).  Everything depends upon the harvesting season and the quality of the plants.  Through his painstaking work and his dedication he acquired three hectares of farmland.  With the land he was able to get good income and support his children.  He now proudly comments, \u201cAll of them live in the United States.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe is proud of what he has achieved.  He wants to continue working the land where he was born until the end of his days.  In all of this time he managed to get a truck, which he uses to transport his fruit and vegetable cargo throughout the country.  In addition, he visits the coast of the country every six months to sell the seeds that he harvests.  He therefore wants to continue planting and improving the quality of his crops.\r\n\r\nHe belongs to the \u201cCapital Semillera\u201d (Seed Money) Commual Bank.  This is his seventh loan with MFP.  He hopes for your collaboration in order to achieve his objectives.  He pledges to make his payments on time.  Fortunato will use the requested loan to buy various sacks of organic fertilizers to apply to his yungay potato crops, which he has planted on a hectare of farmland.  He is thinking of using that land for the \u201c\u00fanica\u201d variety of potato for the next harvest. \r\n

He buys his merchandise locally, in Lom\u00e9, which does not leave him a profit margin in proportion to the size of his business.  Finding that more and more of his customers are disappointed, he has decided to stock goods from Nigeria.  Now, in order to do this, he needs more financial resources.  \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nSo, to expand his business and augment the income he needs for his family that depends on him alone, Mr. A. is requesting a loan of $1,500 to enlarge his shop and to diversify the range of goods offered.  His level of education and his experience are major assets for good management and a profitable business.   \r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nMonsieur A. Messan, n\u00e9 le 17 octobre \u00e0 Ah\u00e9p\u00e9 (Pr\u00e9fectur de Yoto) est mari\u00e9 et p\u00e8re de deux (02) enfants. Apr\u00e8s son baccalaur\u00e9at, ses parents n\u2019avaient plus de moyens pour l\u2019inscrire \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9. Il s\u2019est fait employ\u00e9 dans une boutique de la place o\u00f9 il gagnait un peu de revenus l\u2019aidant \u00e0 subvenir aux besoins des ses trois fr\u00e8res et ses parents devenus inactifs. Les charges devenant plus lourdes et avec ses petites \u00e9conomies et un cr\u00e9dit de $350, il ouvrit une boutique de quincaillerie qu\u2019il g\u00e8re avec rigueur et efficacit\u00e9. L\u2019emplacement g\u00e9ographique de sa boutique, lui am\u00e8ne assez de clients et il a souvent de rupture de stock de certains articles. Il ach\u00e8te ses marchandises sur place ici \u00e0 Lom\u00e9, ce qui ne lui laisse pas une marge b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u00e0 la taille de ses activit\u00e9s. S\u2019apercevant que sa client\u00e8le devient de plus en plus importante qu\u2019il n\u2019arrive pas \u00e0 satisfaire \u00e0 temps, il d\u00e9cide de approvisionner \u00e0 partir du Nig\u00e9ria. Or, ces transactions demandent un fonds de commerce plus important qu\u2019il ne dispose pas. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nAinsi, pour accro\u00eetre ses activit\u00e9s et augmenter ses revenus aux besoins de sa famille qui ne compte que sur lui, Monsieur A. Messan sollicite un cr\u00e9dit de $1500 qui servira \u00e0 agrandir sa boutique et \u00e0 diversifier la gamme de ses articles. Le niveau d\u2019\u00e9tudes et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de Monsieur A. Messan constituent un atout majeur pour une bonne gestion et rentabilit\u00e9 de ses activit\u00e9s.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":11030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To stock up and sell hardware and related goods.

She is from Jun\u00edn, in the beautiful city of Tarma, and is fifty years old and married, with five grown children who are working and studying. She came to Lima because her husband was transferred by his job, and she decided to work in the market selling gelatin desserts on foot. She began selling more and more, and rented a small booth where she began to also sell juice. She now owns her booth and has spent twenty years there; all of her effort has been worth it. Since she has joined Kiva partner FINCA Peru she has learned to be responsible with making punctual payments, and she enjoys the tips she gets on how to improve her business. She requires a loan of 1800 soles in order to expand her business and buy items such as a blender and a display case to generate more sales. She hopes to save enough money to build a more durable booth in the market. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Emily Martyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":260420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a blender, a display case, and other items to improve sales","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paulina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":143.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:23:06Z","rounded_local_amount":457.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20397268},{"amount":143.75,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:10:18Z","rounded_local_amount":457.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27088972},{"amount":143.74,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:59:56Z","rounded_local_amount":457.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35982308},{"amount":143.76,"local_amount":450,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:49:32Z","rounded_local_amount":457.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44442857}],"funded_date":"2009-02-03T05:41:37Z","paid_date":"2009-06-15T22:49:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Emily Martyn","image":null}},{"id":89573,"name":"M\u00f3nica Lizbeth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"MONICA LIZBETH, pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cLAS TRIUNFADORAS\u201d, ubicado en Jr. Los C\u00e9ticos N\u00b0 651 \u2013 San Fernando, Distrito de Manantay, tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad, 04 hijos, su esposo compra y vende productos de la regi\u00f3n.\nSe levanta muy temprano por la ma\u00f1ana, a las 04:00 a.m., para ir con su esposo al puerto fluvial de la ciudad de Pucallpa, compran pl\u00e1tanos, pescado, frutas y animales en variedad.\nEl primer pr\u00e9stamo que recibi\u00f3 fue de S\/.300.00 Nuevos Soles, con los cuales compr\u00f3 30 manos de pl\u00e1tanos, pescado fresco, pescado salado 01 fardo, para venderlo en el mismo puerto fluvial.

L\u1ecdc has been engaged in this business for more than four years and earns approximately 3000000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2005, L\u1ecdc joined TYM Fund (a Kiva partner) to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. L\u1ecdc has successfully repaid a previous loan from TYM Fund. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock.  \r\n<p>\r\nL\u1ecdc is now requesting a new loan of 9000000 VND, which will be used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in future.  The loan will be the fifth loan taken out by the borrower from TYM Fund.  L\u1ecdc plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":304035,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

As for grains, she supplies herself at Dantokpa, the grand international market of Benin.  She buys goods by special order and distributes them on credit to clients.  \r\n\r\nDelphine has already benefited from two loans from Alid\u00e9 and has always repaid them without any difficulties at all. To bolster her business and to satisfy her customers more, she is requesting a third loan from Alid\u00e9.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":343047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy six 5-meter lengths of damask cloth, six small coolers, and two 100-kg sacks of corn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"9.5 2.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2009-06-25T20:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delphine","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15000},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-19T07:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":15156.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63126491},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T10:50:47Z","rounded_local_amount":15156.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73549917},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T11:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":15156.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86983708},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T12:11:08Z","rounded_local_amount":15156.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96896077},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T11:08:33Z","rounded_local_amount":15156.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103735657},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T11:26:54Z","rounded_local_amount":15156.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110623168},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T10:14:13Z","rounded_local_amount":15156.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118019873},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T08:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":15156.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123858367},{"amount":48.56,"local_amount":22411,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-27T23:22:23Z","rounded_local_amount":22644.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130494862},{"amount":16.44,"local_amount":7589,"processed_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:28Z","rounded_local_amount":7667.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136618523}],"funded_date":"2009-06-26T10:36:40Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T09:40:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":122341,"name":"008 Qu\u1ea3ng H\u01b0ng Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Li\u00ean N.

She gradually increased her inventory and now works every day from 7am to 2pm.  Carmen sells Christmas lights for $2.25, toys for $2.00, and glasses for $0.60\/each.  One of the difficulties she faces is combating illness.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan Carmen wants to buy toys and lights for the Christmas season, the time when she sells the most.  In the future she wants to increase her inventory of merchandise and open her own store.

This is his sixth loan from MFP and he is ready to make all his repayments on time since he doesn't want to default and harm his community bank where he is very well liked for the order that he brings to the meetings.

He lives in his own home with his wife Flora, 40, and their 4 beloved children, for whom they wish to provide a better future.  Jorge works as a farmer, an occupation that he learned from his parents when he was very young.  He has been working for 20 years on his own land where he cultivates cocoa plants, coffee and coca leaves in a technical manner.  At harvest times he counts on help from his children and from day workers who provide him with support on various tasks.  Jorge knows very well that the money he gets is related to the good quality of his fruit.  He sells his harvested products in the markets in the cities of San Francisco and Quimbiri, places where he can get the best prices for the special quality of his coffee and cocoa beans and his coca leaves.  What he enjoys most about his work is harvesting the fruit, since that is when he feels that the months of arduous labor pay off in the quality of his fruit.  What he considers most difficult is to transport the heavy sacks of produce from the fields to his community.  In the future, he hopes to buy more land to increase his production.  This is Jorge's 3rd loan with MFP, and he feels capable of making all of his payments.  He is one of the most active members of his communal bank.  The loan that he requests is to buy manure and fertilizers that will be very useful in improving his production.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":762017,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy sacks of manure and fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-05-03T22:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2045.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666060}],"funded_date":"2011-05-04T01:44:19Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":299390,"name":"Reinerio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Reineiro tiene 34 a\u00f1os de edad, es soltero y vive con su familia en casa propia.

They live together as a family in their own home which is located in the small village of Cumutay.\r\n\r\nThis talented woman is a farmer.  Her main crops are potatoes, peas and gladioli.  She tells us that her gladioli constantly make her income as she harvests them weekly.  She has been in this business for 13 years and is well known by the sellers in the wholesale market in Tarma.  They say that she is a hard-working and honest woman.  What Nancy doesn't enjoy about her work are the seasons when the prices for her harvests drop.  However, in spite of the difficulties, she is certain that she will be able to get ahead.\r\n\r\nNancy also sells basic household products in a store that she opened in her home and her business is doing very well.  For this reason, she is thinking of expanding her grocery store but in the town of Tarma where there is more sales activity.\r\n\r\nNancy belongs to the 'Pioneros de Cumutay' (Cumutay Pioneers) community bank and this is her ninth loan from MFP.

She lives with her husband and their children, who are ages 3 to 9 years old.  She started her business with seed capital awarded by the mayor's office.  She put all of her energy into the business to make it grow and generate more income each day, to benefit her family.  Initially, she sold few products.  But with her discipline, she has re-invested her profits, and now she offers a variety of products for sale, such as: food, supplies, sodas, women's articles, household accessories, paper products etc.  Her greatest challenge is having sufficient capital and work to meet the growing demand that exceeds her expectations daily. This is the reason she requested her credikiva, her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  With the loan she will purchase \"family shopping basket\" items and varied merchandise, like women's accessories.  Her investment will be successful because she sells her merchandise on credit.  She would be able to offer better prices to her customers for items purchased in greater volume.

He has lived in Santa Lucia his entire life. Although he is now separated from his wife, he still maintains close contact with his kids, only one of which is still in school. He hopes that he can invest the money from the loan in increasing his production. Thanks to the help of his farm association he feels that he can commercialize his product well if he has enough to sell.  <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> Jose is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":25054,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice Production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-10T18:01:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-04-26T08:26:33Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":172,"local_amount":172,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:18Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":172,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21385},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T23:19:04Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40783},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T18:14:05Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45302},{"amount":716,"local_amount":716,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:12:32Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":716,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99056},{"amount":196,"local_amount":196,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T21:54:25Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T06:51:26Z","rounded_local_amount":196,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106816}],"funded_date":"2007-04-12T08:26:33Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T21:54:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":11741,"name":"Jhonny","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<P>Jhonny has a small business selling fish, pork and poultry.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

A los 15 a\u00f1os ya era madre de su hija Jenny, desde entonces se levantaba muy temprano, a las 5.00am juntamente con su suegra para ayudarla a preparar el almuerzo para los trabajadores de la chacra, y una vez que fue creciendo su hija mayor, ya iba a apoyar a la chacra.

Now she and her husband have four children and they live in the Cumutay villiage. They've built their own adobe house and hope to fill it with plaster so that it is more stable. Flor was a mother at age 15 and since then she's woken up at 5am to help her mother-in-law make lunch for the farm workers. Once her eldest daughter began to grow up, Flor was able to help on the farm. After several years of working for her husband's parents, she began to cultivate her own crops on rented land. Later her husband's parents gave Flor and her husband some land, where they now grow potatoes and peas in large quantities. Little by little they're able to buy more arable land. Farming is profitable and Flor is happy with her work because it gives her time to do everything. The challenge during this time of year is rain, and Flor and her husband fear that it could create a plague for the pea crop.

With the help of his wife, who is a merchant in the informal market, Shoprite, where there is exchange of foreign and domestic products, he was able to collect a fund and begin his own work.\r\n\r\nConsequently he had to leave his sister's house.  Through a conversation with his brother, who is our client, he came to know about the existence of Hluvuku and solicited a loan for 10,000MT to continue his work.  Nelson is not responsible for anyone but is still unable to save any money because he earns so little.  He intends to finish his work as fast as possible and request a new loan to furnish his home.\r\n\r\nThis is Nelson's first loan with Hluvuku and with Kiva.  It will be used to purchase construction materials to continue his work.  He is confident that he will pay off the loan before maturity so he can solicit a new loan to furnish his home.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Jared Wandry, Kiva

His story is representative of both the members of his group and Esperanza's Haitian and Dominican (many of whom recently emigrated from Haiti) clients more generally. His group is based in the areas surrounding Santiago, the second largest city in the DR. Santiago's economy is agricultural and the region is famous for tobacco and beef, despite these benefits, many of the region's poor, including the members of this group have limited access to running water (none of which is potable) or electricity. It is in these conditions that Adrien makes his home as a single father with his 7 year old daughter. \r\n\r\nAdrien is excited to take his first loan with Esperanza. He will use this loan to invest in a business selling used clothing which he will buy in bulk to get a better price.

With the revenues, she plans to give a good education to her daughters.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Nazira wants to enlarge her business by opening a second selling point.

Asadu has been in his commercial motorcycle business in Bwaise-Kampala for one and a half years now. By and large, his circumstances have been a mixture of good and bad. Bad given the increasing competition that directly translates to frustration, especially on days when clients are few. Good on the basis that at least he is able to make ends meet. Often he has had to begin with a new slate after some disappointing days at work. \r\n\r\nUpbeat tenacity, courage and perseverance stand out as his winning attributes. 50,000 shillings as weekly profits is quite modest but he remains optimistic that with this loan he can make a lot of headway in his trade.

Two years ago, she inherited farming land from her father with which she began to sow coffee. Now, she has young coffee plants that provide good kernals. Exploiting this advantage, she sends the grain to be processed, selling natural coffee in great quantities to the different shops in the city of La Merced where she has fixed clients. What she likes the most is to be able to be independent and have the opportunity to grow. Despite her limitations and responsibilities, she is not daunted. On the contrary, she has desires to study and to be able to have a coffee exportation business.

This would allow him to do his work with peace of mind without being forced to resort to informal moneylenders who charge very high rates and would negatively impact his daily available money and his ability to ensure progress both for his work and his family.

This leads to poor financial support and therefore poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n<p>\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.

Some of them will use their loan to begin or continue building a house; others to pay either for themselves to pursue further studies or pay for their children\u2019s education.

She began a business in 1984 with an initial capital of US$ 50. Between 1984 and 1990, the sale of fresh foodstuffs brought her up to a capital of US$ 100, which allowed her to diversify her business by adding on a general store. This also prospered from 1994 to 2000, at which point Chantal was in a traffic accident as she was out buying goods for her store. Her hospitalization of 4 months caused a noticeable diminishing of her business. <P>\r\n\r\nAfter her convalescence, in 2000, she decided to undertake a different type of business, selling beauty products for women. Since she had acquired so much experience in business management over the years, Chantal was able to accumulate a personal capital of US$ 500 by 2006, which allowed her to open a little factory for pure drinking water that she maintains up to today.<P>\r\n\r\nIn view of her  dream of one day opening a big factory making drinking water so as to serve the population of her neighborhood, which has great need of this product, she decided in December of 2007 to join one of the groups of Hope RDC called \u00ab R\u00e9hoboth Plus \u00bb with the goal of increasing her business's financial base. Chantal is a faithful client of Hope and has received several loans, reimbursing them completely and in a timely manner. <P>\r\n\r\nThe loan she has received in this month of June allowed her to buy 1000 packages of bags of pure water so as to satisfy the needs of her customers and thus increase her profit. Presently, her personal capital is more than US$ 500. Her business generates $40 in profit per week. Chantal is a 41-year-old woman, married and the mother of 12 children  from 4 to 24 years of age. Eleven of them are enrolled in school. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3900,"image":{"id":332186,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"purchase of 1000 packages of bags of water for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \n\nIMON's History\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has five independent children, and she lives alone in the La Ladrillera sector of the Cayalt\u00ed district.  It is one hour from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nShe has had a small convenience store set up in her home for six years.  She tells us that she was able to set it up with the savings from her activity of selling animals.  In her business she sells basic needs products (rice, sugar, oil), groceries, and drinks to her neighbors.  She also sells food in the city market on Tuesdays.\r\n\r\nThis business is very useful to the neighbors in the area because it provides them with articles for daily use.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is located in the state of Mexico and has 11 members.  One of the members is Mrs Yuriana A. R. who is 29 years old.  She has been married to Mr Fidel A. Medina, an agricultural worker, for 5 years.  Her husband grows and sells corn.  She has a small fruit and vegetable store and tells us that she decided to set up her business because her husband's income often didn't manage to cover their needs and those of their two children.  When she started in her business she sold in the street from a very small stall and kept her merchandise in her apartment.  She only sold beans and corn since her husband is an agricultural worker and the corn was from his harvests.  After a while, she also began to sell peas and, little by little, her business started to prosper.  She managed to rent premises and began to sell more vegetables.  She would like to use her loan to buy fruit and grow her business.  She believes that in this way her income will increase and she will have the opportunity to give her children a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nIn this same group is Mrs Isabel V..  She is 31 years old and has a dressmaking workshop which she has had for 10 years.  She tells us that since she was 11 years old her parents taught her how to sew since sewing is the main economic activity in their region.  She is alone with her three children.  She began her business with one machine and only sold in the small square in her town each week.  She then began to sew sweatshirts and bermuda shorts.  She started selling in more town squares and, even better, she began to sell her garments to order.  She would like this loan to buy a better variety of fabric so that her business can continue to grow.  Her oldest son is barely 14 years old yet he already dreams of becoming an excellent lawyer."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3700,"image":{"id":636170,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To

For this reason, she decided to request a loan from Ceprodel in order to fulfil her need and to buy vegetables, meat, chicken, rice, oil, sodas and candies to sell."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":772047,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy vegetables, meat, chicken, soda, rice, oil, candies, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"El Sauce","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2011-05-23T03:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ligia Aurelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":573},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":730.76},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":753.42},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":784.72},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":801.1},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":832.29},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":851.73},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":878.14},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":912.95},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":933.66},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":964.55},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":983.68}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.79},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.88},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.9},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.32},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.05},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.45},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.51},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.08},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.02},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.4},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.27}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25.79,"local_amount":573,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T07:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":574.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221639191},{"amount":33.73,"local_amount":749.63,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-27T07:59:16Z","rounded_local_amount":751.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227007422},{"amount":35.78,"local_amount":795.16,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:37:54Z","rounded_local_amount":797.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232766678},{"amount":37.95,"local_amount":843.42,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-16T08:46:37Z","rounded_local_amount":845.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238573799},{"amount":39.14,"local_amount":869.87,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-17T08:47:18Z","rounded_local_amount":872.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244531738},{"amount":38.9,"local_amount":864.51,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-28T08:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":866.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250741080},{"amount":39.03,"local_amount":867.35,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-13T07:53:41Z","rounded_local_amount":869.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257148186},{"amount":199.68,"local_amount":4437.06,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-21T07:42:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4449.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263278877}],"funded_date":"2011-05-27T03:00:29Z","paid_date":"2012-04-21T07:42:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":303518,"name":"Judas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Judas is 38 years old and married with four children ages 13-4 years.

Later, she started selling eggs. Eventually, she opened a storefront and has been continuing to slowly expand her business. Lourdes reports that her sales are currently down due to school vacations but she has a good business because she has the only store on the block.\r\n\r\nLourdes is requesting a loan to stock her store with rice, sugar, noodles, lentils, toilet paper, and soft drinks and to purchase ceramics to paint. This will be her first loan. In the past, she was afraid to put herself in debt. Now, as her businesses have grown, she is confident she can repay her loan. Lourdes believes this loan will help her move forward with her children.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th century BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet and New Western culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Commerce has been her primary source of support.  When her small son arrived 12 years ago, she had to choose work that would allow her to spend more time at home taking care of him and helping him with his homework and education.  That is why she started to sell clothes at home.  She visits the homes of her friends and neighbors to offer different articles of clothing that she buys in one of the most well known commercial centers in Lima, which is in the center of the city.  Susana sells at low prices, and that is why she has a lot of customers.  Through her work efforts she has been able to buy two \u201cmotocarros\u201d (three wheeled motorized cart).  She rents them out by the day, which gives her extra income.\r\n\r\nIn the near future, Susana would like to have a clothing store in her house so that she would not have to walk so much.\r\n\r\nThis is her sixth loan with MFP.  She is very happy with her supportive group.  The members are very punctual, and they are all good friends.  The money will be used to buy more clothes in order to increase her sales and earnings.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":362502,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-04T15:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":131.45},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":158.9},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":164.35},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":173.44},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":178.89},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":189.3},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":199.05},{"due_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":204.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.6},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":53.91},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.76},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.85},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.69},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.23},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.54},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":44.6,"local_amount":131.45,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:28:55Z","rounded_local_amount":134.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081119},{"amount":53.91,"local_amount":158.9,"processed_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:59:08Z","rounded_local_amount":162.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997269},{"amount":55.76,"local_amount":164.35,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:10Z","rounded_local_amount":167.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842613},{"amount":213.12,"local_amount":628.14,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:52Z","rounded_local_amount":640.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734189},{"amount":38.19,"local_amount":112.54,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":114.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992359},{"amount":69.42,"local_amount":204.62,"processed_date":"2010-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:01Z","rounded_local_amount":208.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717192}],"funded_date":"2009-08-04T23:52:41Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":130596,"name":"Vian John","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vian John Q. is from the village of Kinangay Sur, Clarin, Misamis Occidental.

He lives with his wife and two children and is the sole income provider for his family. He has been running a bakery since 1995. Throughout Lebanon it is common to find small bakeries with delicious bread, pastries, and \u201cmanouche\u201d, a type of Lebanese pizza. The borrower is requesting a loan of $1200 from Kiva partner, Ameen s.a.l. He plans to use the loan to invest in a new machine for mixing dough. This will be his first loan from Ameen. \r\n\r\nNote: Based on the political and social challenges of Lebanon, personally identifiable attributes of this entrepreneur have been altered to protect him or her (i.e. blacking out portions of the entrepreneur in his\/her picture, not indicating his\/her name and location, etc.).

She is 24 and single. Like Chynygul, she works at village administration. She also needs a cell phone. She applied for a loan in order to buy a cell phone which will move her to a new level of communication with her relatives, friends, and colleagues. As she receives her wages, she will gradually repay her loan.\r\n<p>\r\nKanatbek M. is 28 and married. He has two children, a four-year-old daughter and a two-year-old son. His wife is a housewife. Two years ago, he decided to start cattle breeding with an initial investment of 2,000 soms. For now, he receives 1,500 soms monthly, but he plans to increase the number of cattle and, as a result, increase profits from cattle breeding. Also, cattle breeding helped him to buy his car, a Daewoo Tico. In order to increase the number of cattle, he needs to buy more heads of cattle. Unfortunately, he doesn\u2019t have enough funds. Thus, he is applying for a loan. With the profit from cattle breeding, he plans to increase the number of cattle. \r\n<p>\r\nGulhan T. is 58 and married. She has five children. Her sons are 33 and 26, and her daughters are 37, 36, and 29. Her daughters are married and live independently. Her first son is a teacher at a college, and her second son is in Russia. Her husband is a pensioner, while she breeds cattle with the help of her first son. Six years ago she decided to buy a cow because, in her opinion, it was safer than just holding money. After that, she decided to breed cattle. Now, they have 25 heads of cattle, which they will fatten and sell. With the profit from cattle breeding, she could buy a car for her son and make capital repairs to her house. Starting her business with 2,000 soms, she now makes 20,000 soms monthly. She is applying for a loan in order to buy two goats, fatten them, and resell them in the future at a higher price. With the profit from cattle breeding, she plans to buy a truck for transportation of cattle. \r\n<p>\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n<p>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious, and socially focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan.

Y como tiene muchos planes, para el futuro tiene el anhelo de instalar un restaurante en su zona, donde ofrecer\u00e1 sus mejores platillos, de esta manera espera seguir progresando. Es el segundo cr\u00e9dito que tiene con MFP y promete pagar sus cuotas puntualmente, pues esta muy agradecida con todas las personas que hicieron posible este aporte que le permitir\u00e1 continuar trabajando en busca del progreso. Evarista tiene planeado invertir el cr\u00e9dito solicitado en la compra de ingredientes, al por mayor, que le hacen falta para continuar preparando sus platillos en mayor cantidad, de esta manera espera seguir progresando. \n\n","en":"Evarista is 50 years old and lives alone in her own home, as her children now have their own families and they come to visit from time to time.  For the last 4 years this enterprising woman has sold food in a local market.  Every day she wakes up very early to start cooking, for by noon she must have available 30 meals, which she offers to her regular diners.  She likes her work a lot, for it keeps her busy and generates regular earnings, which allow her to live comfortably.  What she doesn\u2019t like is that when she offers meals on credit, some diners fall behind in paying punctually, and this slows down her revenue.  She sells her meals from 12 noon to 2 in the afternoon, and then rests from her work.  She has many plans, such as for the future she would like to set up a restaurant in the area, where she will offer her best meals.  She hopes thereby to continue to grow.  This is the second loan she will have with MFP, and she promises to pay the installments promptly, for she is very grateful to all those who have made this support possible, which will enable her to keep working and moving forward.  Evarista plans to use the requested loan to buy wholesale the commodities needed to continue preparing her meals in larger quantities.  She thus hopes to keep on making progress."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":666318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy commodities wholesale, and avoid problems when preparing her meals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-17T19:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Evarista ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":67.65},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":70.1},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75.7},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":75.38},{"due_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":78.95},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":80.97},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":84.55},{"due_date":"2011-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":86.39},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":90.52},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":93.7},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":96.75},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":99.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.37},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.29},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.38},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.27},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.61},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.36},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.71},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.39},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.95},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.14},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.28},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.37,"local_amount":67.65,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:51Z","rounded_local_amount":71.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463644},{"amount":26.29,"local_amount":70.1,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:33Z","rounded_local_amount":74.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887024},{"amount":28.38,"local_amount":75.7,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:28Z","rounded_local_amount":79.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327383},{"amount":28.27,"local_amount":75.38,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:43Z","rounded_local_amount":79.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195944},{"amount":29.61,"local_amount":78.95,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:25Z","rounded_local_amount":83.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269624},{"amount":30.36,"local_amount":80.97,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:09Z","rounded_local_amount":85.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549616},{"amount":31.36,"local_amount":83.64,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":88.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718350},{"amount":32.44,"local_amount":86.5,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:48Z","rounded_local_amount":91.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227349916},{"amount":34.25,"local_amount":91.32,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":96.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850495},{"amount":35.14,"local_amount":93.7,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":99.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665746},{"amount":73.53,"local_amount":196.09,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:50Z","rounded_local_amount":207.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244620945}],"funded_date":"2010-12-17T19:45:44Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Jane Wilkie","image":null}},{"id":262554,"name":"Tim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tim S. is a 54-year-old widower and is blessed with seven children; three are single and four are married.

","en":"22-year-old Aura Lila is a single mother who has a three-year-old son.  She lives in Guisquiliapa.  Aura Lila makes tortillas, nacatamales (Nicaraguan tamales) and corn-based products.  She has been in this business for five years and started out in the business because her mother pushed her to make her own income from a young age.  Her mother taught her how to make tortillas and, before that, she used to go out and sell them.\r\n\r\nAnother member of this group is Dora Elizabeth who is 24 years old and married.  Her business is making tortillas.  She also sells baked beans and  other corn-based products such as 'tortilla dulce' (sweet tortillas) etc.  She started her business because of the lack of work that plagues her country.  She had to find a way of making her own income in order to support her household.

When she was nine years old she learned the profession of making hammocks.  Her mother was the one who taught her this craft, which has been generational.  Her grandmother taught her mother, and her mother taught her daughters.  All of them have their own business making hammocks, and it is their source of income.\r\n\r\nShe makes the hammocks at her house.  In order to do this she needs to go to the city once a week to buy the materials she needs.  She leaves her house at 5:00 in the morning headed towards town.  This is due to the fact that Maria lives on a hill, and she walks a half an hour to get to the route where she takes the bus that takes her to town.  At 7:30 a.m. she is preparing the pita fiber (material for making hammocks) in order to turn it into the rope.\r\n\r\nMaria wants to increase and improve her production.  That is why she is requesting a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Campo.  She will use the loan to buy a greater quantity of materials.  One thing she will buy is the pita.  It is more expensive and more sought-after, and the hammocks sell more quickly.\r\n\r\nWith this loan she will be purchasing better quality materials to make the hammocks softer, which make them more sellable.  This will allow her to increase her income and at the same type satisfy her customers\u2019 demand.\r\n\r\nShe wishes to make her house bigger and to build it from concrete blocks.  Her children are growing and need space.  Five people live in the house, therefore the space for making the hammocks is small.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":879905,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to buy materials to make her hammocks.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Gotera","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2011-09-28T00:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":30.13},{"due_date":"2011-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":29.98},{"due_date":"2011-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":31.06},{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":31.46},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":32.11},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33.08},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33.44},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":34.23},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":34.81},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":35.6},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2012-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":37.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.13},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.98},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.06},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":31.46},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.11},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.08},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.44},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.23},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.81},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.6},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.25},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":31.82,"local_amount":31.82,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T09:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":31.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238807070},{"amount":32,"local_amount":32,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244562701},{"amount":32.47,"local_amount":32.47,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:03:01Z","rounded_local_amount":32.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250773825},{"amount":33.17,"local_amount":33.17,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":33.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317355},{"amount":31.99,"local_amount":31.99,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:24:22Z","rounded_local_amount":31.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270033047},{"amount":33.49,"local_amount":33.49,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:35:28Z","rounded_local_amount":33.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276645267},{"amount":27.19,"local_amount":27.19,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:21:53Z","rounded_local_amount":27.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283491720},{"amount":55.02,"local_amount":55.02,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-17T08:05:12Z","rounded_local_amount":55.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287736274},{"amount":37.14,"local_amount":37.14,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T08:39:44Z","rounded_local_amount":37.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294561564},{"amount":85.71,"local_amount":85.71,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:05:16Z","rounded_local_amount":85.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308399827}],"funded_date":"2011-09-28T01:08:22Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:05:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":344535,"name":"Dinara","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dinara is 44 years old and is married to a security guard.

She works with great effort for them and wants to continue to do so to build a prominent and promising future. Ever since she was a little girl, she has been dedicated to farming activities. She was raised this way and it has been a stable source of income until this day.<P>\r\n\r\nFor more than 11 years, Mutabar together with her husband has been raising sheep and also growing some crops on their land. To continue to work and to obtain a very good quantity and quality, Mutabar wants to borrow money for growing hay and other feed for his sheep on his land. For that she needs to purchase seeds and fertilizer. Let\u2019s show solidarity to this selfless mother who looks for what is best for her children. <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She supplies herself from rural producers in the towns near Sikasso and then sells the goods retail, cash or credit accepted, in Ni\u00e8na and in mining zones.

Mely has successfully repaid a previous loan of 6,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used for additional working capital. Mely is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase kerosene, and as working capital. This loan will be the 8th loan taken out by Mely from PMPC.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":431596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials  in bulk for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Felista","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:46:25Z","rounded_local_amount":83656.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757764},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:14Z","rounded_local_amount":83656.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146858},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:08Z","rounded_local_amount":83656.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123985003},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:30Z","rounded_local_amount":83656.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015676},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":83656.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740682},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:04:40Z","rounded_local_amount":83656.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773796}],"funded_date":"2009-12-03T04:23:55Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:04:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":159500,"name":"Gotitas Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Banco D.
