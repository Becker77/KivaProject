Flaviana is married to a farmer. To make a living, Flaviana owns and operates a sari-sari (general) store. Flaviana has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 6,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Flaviana joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Flaviana has successfully repaid a previous loan from PMPC. Flaviana is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and provide working capital. This loan will be the 6th loan taken out by Flaviana from PMPC.

With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Virginia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 25,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 19th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 25,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for her dried fish business so that she can continue to save up for the future for the education of her children. Virginia P. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b> In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon.

Usaha yang dijalani saat ini adalah berjualan rujak. Setiap pagi, dengan diantar suaminya menggunakan sepeda motor, dia harus pergi ke Pasar Badung untuk belanja kebutuhan untuk membuat rujak, seperti bumbu, buah-buahan, dan kacang. Jarak antara rumahnya dan Pasar Badung tidak terlalu jauh, sehingga dia tidak terlalu menyita waktu suaminya yang bekerja sebagai buruh bangunan. Tempat dia berjualan rujak adalah di depan rumahnya. Pembelinya adalah kebanyakan orang sekitar dan juga orang luar yang sudah sering beli rujak ditempatnya. Penghasilannya cukup untuk membayar sewa kontrak tanah yang sekarang ditempatinya bersama suaminya dan ketiga orang anaknya. Dia berharap diberi bantuan pinjaman untuk dijadikan tambahan modal usaha."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":161689,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To add working capital (Menambah Modal Usaha)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Badung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.5 115.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-05-22T12:50:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sariyati","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-06-05T12:56:09Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":12.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":13,"local_amount":104000,"processed_date":"2008-06-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":121082.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":245527},{"amount":13,"local_amount":104000,"processed_date":"2008-07-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:43:09Z","rounded_local_amount":121082.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":273991},{"amount":13,"local_amount":104000,"processed_date":"2008-08-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T02:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":121082.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":303491},{"amount":13,"local_amount":104000,"processed_date":"2008-09-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:22:34Z","rounded_local_amount":121082.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":334315},{"amount":10.5,"local_amount":84000,"processed_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T02:43:32Z","rounded_local_amount":97797.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308452},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-22T08:55:09Z","rounded_local_amount":116425.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9925405},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":116425.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849703},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-18T08:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":116425.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20389163},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T17:45:00Z","rounded_local_amount":116425.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27080569},{"amount":12.5,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T15:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":116425.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35973795}],"funded_date":"2008-05-22T12:56:09Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T15:21:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":53158,"name":"Alima","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alima A. is fifty years old. She is married and has three children, all of whom are currently in school. For twenty years now (and counting), she has been a local manufacturer of palm oil and palm kernel oil, which are used to prepare many local dishes. For clarity, she notes that palm oil is produced from palm nuts whereas palm kernel oil is produced from palm kernel and that palm kernel oil is a by-product of palm oil. Normally, she alternates production between the two products: that is, after producing palm oil, she automatically obtains the raw materials to produce palm kernel oil, and so on.

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192593,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase rice in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:40:40Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tutindaga N.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T19:44:48Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356214},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347956},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:07Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970530},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886747},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:24Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436007}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T19:44:48Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65453,"name":"Rukhsora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"G.

She is married and has 8 school-aged children. To make a living, Rebecca owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Rebecca has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns ~3,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Rebecca joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rebecca has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used as additional business capital. Rebecca is requesting a new loan of 13000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her fourth loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family\u2019s income.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

They live in the Pueblo Joven Jos\u00e9 Olaya, which is located in the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nShe has been making clothes for 15 years.  She makes articles of clothing for women, men, and children.  She takes various orders from the city.  This activity is the only source of income for her family.  He husband is in charge of delivering the clothing that she makes.\r\n\r\nRosa has gotten ahead in her business with the support of the Institution.  She started with a small amount of money and her first loan, which she used to buy a sewing machine.  From then on she has continued working with much effort to earn her sustenance.  She built her house, and she now plans to give her two children, ages 18 and 15, a college education.\r\n\r\nRosa\u2019s work is very good and original.  There is much demand for the clothing she makes.  That is why she has seen the necessity of asking the Institution for a new loan for 1,500 PEN.  She will use the loan to buy fabric and thread to continue making her customers\u2019 orders.\r\n\r\nDuring the three years that Rosa has been working with the Institution, she has demonstrated punctuality and responsibility with her payments.  Therefore, she is considered to be an excellent client.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":374108,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Buy fabric and thread to make clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"P.J.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Imelda C.'s Group.\r\n\r\nImelda is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, Imelda raises crops. The main source of income for her business comes from planting and harvesting  a variety of vegetables for sale. Imelda has been engaged in her business for over 21 years and earns approximately 8,500 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Imelda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Imelda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizers, such as manure. Imelda is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. This will be the second loan taken out by Imelda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

B., 30, is an industrial engineer with a microbusiness called Alusso Leather.  Owning her own business has been a dream for Adriana since she was 6 years old.

She will use the supplies to make products for the upcoming holiday season.  Adriana plans to position herself in the local market within six months, a real challenge because she faces a lot of competition.  However, her designs are attractive to buyers and she expects her sales to take off over the coming holidays.  \r\n  \r\nAdriana is an entrepreneurial young woman and focused on building her business.  She has always known that she wanted to be an entrepreneur and now she's fulfilling her dream.

She started by making bags and gradually added footwear, taking advantage of the experience of her parents and other members of her family who could show her the way.  She has skill and she believes that will help her make a success of the business quickly.  Adriana is committed to making high-quality products because she ultimately wants to establish a position in the national market.

Needless to say, most people residing in these areas live below the poverty line. Sylvia was once part of that group.

They have three children who are between 3 and 12 years old. Mary Ann joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Mary Ann has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her fifth loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000 to use as additional working capital so that she could continue to save up for her children's future education. Mary Ann is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus, they are termed not-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets.  This leads to poor financial support, which in turn leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys from and leases equipment to women.  Where a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from the said client extending a loan to her, and then leases back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a \"sale and leaseback arrangement\"."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":100690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

It is the kind of place local people usually send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal and don't have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":192612,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy soap, sugar, tomatoes, etc. for re-sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-20T23:20:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Junes N.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-04T13:46:07Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-10-04T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-15T07:16:36Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":347892},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:48Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347963},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970537},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:01Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886754},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436014}],"funded_date":"2008-08-21T13:46:07Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":65469,"name":"Chu Thi","description":{"languages":["vi","en"],"texts":{"vi":"Mrs. Chu Thi T. is 50 years old.

For the last 20 years she has worked in this craft which she learned as a child. She made her hobby her profession, since she has always enjoyed sewing. The hardest part for her is to obtain material to use to create her products, since the price can be quite high. Nevertheless, she works hard every day.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She runs a firewood and palm oil business. Pauline lives and sells her products in Bamenda, Cameroon, near GHAPE. She will use her loan to purchase firewood, palm oil, rice, corn and beans to resell at her store on Foncha Street. \r\n \r\nThis is Pauline\u2019s seventh loan from GHAPE since she became a beneficiary in 2001. She has had her business for long enough to know that she will be successful with this loan. She sees that her customers, that is, her community, benefit from her business because they do not need to travel as far to have access to firewood and her food products. She also sells her products at moderate prices, so she believes she is competitive.\r\n\r\nShe has used profits from previous loansto buy items for her business\u2019s kitchen, essentially investing in her business. With this loan, she hopes to use the profits to pay for her children\u2019s school fees and their books. Pauline prefers GHAPE loans because they allow long-term loans and that has helped her be able to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":285742,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase firewood and vegetables for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Foncha St, Nkwen, NW.

Adem\u00e1s, cuenta con el apoyo de sus suegros, que le brindan sus tierras a sin ning\u00fan costo, por ello que sus metas a corto plazo son de comprar sus propias chacras de cultivo y un terreno donde pueda construir su casa.

","en":"Jencen, 21, lives with his partner with whom he has a son.  For now, they're living with her parents.  He's had a thorough understanding of farm life from the time he was a boy because his parents are farmers.  Proudly, happily, he turns over the top layer of soil in his fields so that he can later fertilize them and ensure a good crop when the harvest rolls around.  Afterwards, he'll sell the crop in the markets in the city or, perhaps, he's thinking, sell right from the field to avoid the transportation costs.  Jecen is proud to be a farmer.  It's his only work and, for the most part, it's been a profitable business.  He counts on support from his in-laws who provide land to him at no cost.  Jencen's short-term goal is to buy his own farm and land where he can build a house.  To reach his goal, he's starting at the bottom.  He says that the goal is difficult but not impossible.  The money that he's applying to borrow is for chemical fertilizers to fertilize the potato fields that he seeded 3 days ago.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":314415,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-09T00:20:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jencen","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":675}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":675,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2028.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733828}],"funded_date":"2009-05-11T15:05:41Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:24:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":110537,"name":"Leonida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonida P. lives in Buenavista, Pagadian City, Zamboanga Del Sur.

He lives with his wife and their children in a large traditional family in Wayerma I, one of the residential neighborhoods in Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\nAfter havng tried a variety of different activities without success, three years ago Mr. Kon\u00e9 started his business of buying and selling white damask fabric, caustic soda, dyes, etc. He carries out this activity at Wayerma I, across from the Malian Agency for Press and Advertising  (AMAP) in Sikasso, not far from the central prison, where he has a shop. Mr. Kon\u00e9 is very much sought after by his customers because of the quality of his products. Mindful of meeting the needs of his ever growing number of customers, he joined micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso more than two years ago. He is on his third individual loan, his previous loans all having been properly repaid. This new loan will allow him to buy 20 packets of caustic soda, 17 pieces of damask, 13 bags of potash, 15 boxes of dye in different colors, etc. He gets his supplies in Bamako (the capital of Mali) and sells to a clientele made up mostly of women who dye fabric and who are from the town of Sikasso and the surrounding area. With this new loan he expects to make a monthly profit of 200,000 CFA francs which will mainly be used to contribute towards household expenses and pay interest on the loan, the rest being invested in his business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah  Puchner, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":558471,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy various articles","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:37Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dramane","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913677},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:20Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180808},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:29Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476777},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:08Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613490},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188751918},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:13Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606163},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:15Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917794},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:57Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360740},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-04-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226111},{"amount":95,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:23Z","rounded_local_amount":50661.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301049}],"funded_date":"2010-07-08T16:59:34Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Puchner","image":669957}},{"id":213816,"name":"Demetrio","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Se\u00f1or Demetrio H.

M. is forty one years old, single and has two children aged twenty two years old and nineteen years old whom she hopes to give a quality university education. Her business is located at Choka, near a very busy highway in Nairobi. She sells timber, twisted bars, galvanised iron pipes, paints, nails, water pipes, taps, cement, iron sheets, bolts and other items to local builders. Most of her customers are loyal repeat customers and walk-ins. \r\n\r\nShe has been in this business for the last nine months and she says the business is profitable. She says that the business is very good and the only major challenge she has is slow moving stock as potential customers do not purchase building materials since they fear to build because of land ownership issues. However, she works very hard from early morning to late evening to ensure that her business is doing well. She is taking a loan of  50,000 Kenyan shillings (KES) to replenish her stock of iron sheets, water pipes and nails. In future she sees herself build her own business premise in which she will be serving thousands of customers.

His house has became very old and uncomfortable to live in. Therefore he has started to repair his house recently. \r\n\r\nBut due to a lack of money, he has been unable to finish the repair and adjustments. Enkhbaatar is asking for a loan to purchase building materials in order to finish the repair of the house. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":891989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase building materials in order to finish repairing his house.

is made up of 11 hardworking, indigenous ladies with a great desire to get ahead and succeed in life.  They decided to call the group \u201cAbasolo San Juan Jicayan\u201d because they are proud of their area, its art, culture, and clothing.\r\n\r\nThe members of this group are indigenous and don\u2019t speak very much Spanish.  They communicate in Mixteco.\r\n\r\nTheir dress is a huipil skirt, or better known as nagua, and a small white top.  Only grandmothers wear this type of outfit because this style of dress is disappearing more and more each day.\r\n\r\nFransisca is one of the members.  She\u2019s 31 years old and is a humble woman with a desire to please.

He has lived in Baba, Ecuador for his entire life working in agriculture. His education is very limited, but he has been able to raise two children through his rice cultivation.

All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. \r\n\r\n<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution.\r\n\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":25980,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-13T05:58:51Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-01T06:46:53Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1075,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-07-30T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-08-30T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":179.15}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.17},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":179.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":86,"local_amount":86,"processed_date":"2007-06-16T16:54:18Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:22:56Z","rounded_local_amount":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23686},{"amount":86,"local_amount":86,"processed_date":"2007-10-25T23:38:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:22:56Z","rounded_local_amount":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71901},{"amount":823,"local_amount":823,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:20:47Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:22:56Z","rounded_local_amount":823,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99062},{"amount":80,"local_amount":80,"processed_date":"2008-05-14T17:02:17Z","settlement_date":"2008-05-15T09:22:56Z","rounded_local_amount":80,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":210205}],"funded_date":"2007-04-17T06:46:53Z","paid_date":"2008-05-14T17:02:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12225,"name":"Norma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p> My name is Norma P. and I produce and sell tortillas.

He is single and independent and lives in a room he rents in the neighborhood of San Francisco in the city of Juliaca.  He dedicates himself to working as a taxi driver.  He goes around the city of Juliaca in search of clients.  He has dedicated himself to this business for 10 years and during this time the streets have taught him this hard trade.  He usually works all day but has the most clients in the mornings as most people are trying to get to work and school.  He likes to work with his motorcycle which he considers his most important tool and most loyal friend.  However, as with all work, there are some difficult parts of the job and in Teofilo's case it is the great physical effort that is required to transport people.  Teofilo tries hard every day to improve his economic situation which currently is not too good.  He wants to improve with his business.  With the money he will receive from this loan he will be able to purchase parts for his motorcyle in order to provide a better service for his clients.

It is almost 5 years since Melonne has been living in Abomey Calavi, in Benin. Married to Tohon Sosthene, a driver, Melonne is the mother of  two children all in school. Melonne has 3  more other children at her care. The couple live together with the children. Together, Melonne and her husband bear the expenses of the family. To contribute to the family expenses, Melonne runs a hairdressing salon at home and sells hair extensions in the salon through the same opportunity.\r\nIt is in Dantokpa, the international market of Benin that Melonne gets the products that she needs for the smooth running  of her salon. Melonne has been doing this business for  about eight years and has already got a loan from ALIDe that she repaid. Melonne wants to extend more her hairdressing salon and to beef up her working tools in order to meet the demands  of her customers.

Her desire is to open a shop one day where she can sell her bread, to have at least 2 employees from the community where she lives, and be able to pay for her children's studies, since she herself was not even able to finish primary school. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2825,"image":{"id":685166,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buying supplies for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Estado de M\u00e9xico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":158,"posted_date":"2011-01-04T19:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2825,"lender_count":77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Araceli","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yeni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Norma Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jaqueline Tomasa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Monica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esmeralda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilian","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":34500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":1771},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1816},{"due_date":"2011-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":1863},{"due_date":"2011-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1911},{"due_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","amount":1960},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2010},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2062},{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2115},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2169},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2225},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2282},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":2340},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2400},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":2462},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2525},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":2589}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":145.02},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":148.7},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.55},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":156.48},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":160.49},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.59},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.84},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":173.19},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.6},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":182.2},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.86},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.6},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.53},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":201.59},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.76},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":212}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":762.34,"local_amount":9310,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":9343.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191403465},{"amount":698.8,"local_amount":8534,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:35:20Z","rounded_local_amount":8564.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195982107},{"amount":983.92,"local_amount":12016,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":12058.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201264155},{"amount":379.94,"local_amount":4640,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:39:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4656.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206131064}],"funded_date":"2011-01-08T02:03:46Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T10:39:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":267102,"name":"Joseph","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joseph M. is from the village of Omonay, Damulog, Bukidnon.

He works in the agriculture and livestock industry. His strength is in raising livestock, but he is dedicated to cultivating his crops through fumigation and care in order to obtain a good harvest. He would like to invest in his livestock business by purchasing cows to obtain milk for sustenance and commercialization.

With your help, Zaini can get ahead.<P>\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan<BR>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history and diverse culture, which is a mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet influence, and Central Asian traditions. It served as a key post along the Silk Road and marked the end of Alexander the Great's extensive rule. It was the birthplace of the great Persian poet Rudaki and famous Islamic philosopher Ibn Sina. And it is home to epic mountain passes, communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.<P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<BR>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":295049,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase

old.  She is married and the mother of 4 children.  Her husband went to Russia for work.  Here he could not find a good job that would allow him to save money and purchase livestock for himself.  Konsulo only had 4 sheep, but recently she found out about credit from our organization and came to take out a loan for the purchase of one dairy cow.  Konsulo will milk the cow and give the milk to her children.  If there are leftovers, she will sell them.  Until her husband finds a job in Russia and sends money, her brother will help her.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Sabina Holzman, Kiva

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

She is married to Ireneo M., a shoe repairman. They have been blessed with children who are still studying right now. At this time, Delia is working hard to be able to send her children all the way through college. This is a dream for most Filipino parents like Delia, as she herself is a high school graduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents can leave to their children. \r\n\r\nDelia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five pesos' worth of cooking oil or an egg. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She makes a profit by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling them at retail piece rates. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her variety store, she is requesting a 45,000 PHP loan. She plans to use this loan to buy more products like groceries, toiletries and beverages so as to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nDelia dreams of being able to give all of her children a good and high-quality education through all of her hard work in her business. She looks forward to having her children get a stable job someday. Delia also prays for her own commercial space in their public market. As a CCT community partner, she faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship meeting* where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies. \r\n\r\n*All CCT community members are organized into fellowship groups composed of 15 to 30 community partners that meet on a weekly basis. The fellowship groups gather to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.

daughter in law Irma. This is the first time they are on the loan.  \n\nThey work as merchants. Guadalupe is the group's representative. She is 60 year old and has been in a common law marriage with Hilario for 33 years. Hilario works in the fields.  \n \nThe three will invest in their businesses, a grocery store and paper store. These are family businesses. Irma attends to the store. Her husband started the business but she is the one who is in charge of it. She has been doing this for three months, but the business is already 30 years old. Guadalupe and Hilario run it.\n\nThis time, Guadalupe has taken out the loan to buy everything she needs for the business, such as detergent, milk, bread, eggs, canned goods, drinks, rice, and seeds. Irma will invest in her paper store such as backpacks and notebooks, which is what is most needed at this time.  \n\nGuadalupe's challenge is that there is a lot of competition. A lot of stores have been opened nearby and because of that her sales have gone down considerably, since before she made double or triple what she makes now. Nonetheless, one of her goals is to have a well stocked store again, since a lot of store close quickly, but she has always liked having her store. She would also like to enlarge it a little.  \n\nThey are very grateful for the loan. Guadalupe remarks: \u201cI am very happy with the opportunity that has been given me, since without your help I would never have been able to lift the business up, because I didn't have the money to buy what my store needed. For us it has been very difficult to get money, since my husband makes very little, and the earnings from the store are to make more.\u201d

He finished a secondary school in the Sevakar village, and then, after finishing school, was accepted and graduated from the Kapan Mining College, where he obtained a profession of an electrician.  Currently, Donik works an electrician.  Donik is married and has four children: three sons and a daughter.  His daughter and oldest son already have their own families and live separately from the parents.  The middle and youngest sons live with the parents.  Parallel to his electrician work, Donik has been involved in agriculture for almost 20 years.  He has a small plot of land in the Sevakar village, where he grows vegetables and fruits and breeds cattle and chickens.  Donik sells his agricultural products in the city of Kapan.  His wife and two sons help Donik with the agricultural business, thanks to which they support the family and provide it daily with the necessary, fresh products.  Donik needs a loan in the sum of 1,000,000 dram to purchase two cows and three calves, which would help him to increase his family's income in the future.  This is Donik's third loan from the Nor Horizon organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2625,"image":{"id":943045,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to

There is much competition, especially in public transportation with the amount of vehicles on the road and the creation of new routes.

The loan will be used for working tools, costs related to repairing vehicles, and costs related to improving their conditions in general. The members of the group are responsible and committed.
