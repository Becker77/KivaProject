If a member of the group is unable to make a payment, the other members are responsible for making up the difference and helping the person to improve. This group-lending method creates a social support network within the community as well as an accountability system to ensure that not only are loans paid back on time, but that the loan capital is invested in developing their business and providing for the basic necessities of their families.<p>\r\nLidia is very involved in her neighborhood and believes that the loans have helped her not only improve the livelihood of her family, but have also allowed her a little extra free time to integrate more with her community so that she can give back to those who need her help.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She sells grains such as corn, barley, peas, beans, and quinoa.  She grows these products herself on her land.  She has been doing this for more than 3 years.  Every Wednesday and on the weekends, she sells her grains both wholesale and retail.  Because of this, she is always dependent on the market prices because her profits depend on them.  In this way, Jackqueline sees the fruits of her labor, and, along with her husband, they generate the development of their family.  Her hope for the future is to be able to produce grains on a large scale and to become a successful merchant.  This is her first credit with Microfinanzas Prisma.

She owns a business planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Malama has two years of experience in this business.  Malama needs a loan of WST $1,000 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Malama joined SPBD.  This is her second loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Malama's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

She is 23 years old. Jenelyn is married and has 2 infant-aged children. To make a living, Jenelyn owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods & snacks in the local community. Jenelyn has been engaged in her business for over 2 years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Jenelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jenelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory & working capital. Jenelyn is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Jenelyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand the business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

MatilD. has a fast food business where she sells hot dogs, burgers, fries and 'chicha' (a corn-based drink).

In the afternoons, she works in Malambo, another town in the same department.\r\n\r\nMatilD.'s business has little working capital since her sales are generally carried out in cash and she has little inventory of raw materials and supplies.  She makes her purchases daily in grocery stores.  MatilD.'s goal is to increase her working capital so that she can buy her products in greater quantities and gain discounts for buying in bulk.

the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She started with a simple soft drink sales, but as the people who came buying at her stall where asking for basic daily products as well, she decided to ask FAMA for a loan, ad she took the necessary steps to set the corner shop she now owns. Her main advantage is being a well-known person in her village, and for this reason her neighbors prefer to buy their products in her corner shop.\n\nThe loan Enma is requesting will be used to buy

Barreto runs a textile shop where she makes crochet backpacks in the city of San Jacinto, Bolivar, a population full of artisans and farmers where neighbors are very unified.  She is married with a 10 year old son; her husband is a SENA nurse and has worked in hospitals; however, currently he is not working in the medical field and is running a moto-taxi service with his own vehicle.  Yenny is requesting a loan of $800 which she will invest in the purchase of cloth to make school uniforms and take advantage of kids entering school; she will also use it to perform maintenance on her sewing machines and to buy thread to make her backpacks.\r\n\r\nIn spite of being only 29 years old, Yenny has worked in her shop since she was 17.  Initially she worked with a friend who taught her the job, but later she took sewing classes and trained in the SENA how to embroider.  She enrolled in the Foundation in 2008 and has grown her business; she has another sewing machine and offers great customer service.  Her work has improved and she is very grateful for the loans she has received from the Foundation.  Even though she still has difficult moments when sales drop and her family income drops, luckily she works in a shop where she is paid by her own production.

Rizal, Brgy. Poblacion, Dalaguete, Cebu.  She earns her living by operating a general store  business.  Her husband Ignacio B., who is 50 years old, works as a maintenance man to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have two children who are 22 and 23 years old. \r\n\r\nGilla joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 17 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gilla has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 15,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 18,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she intends to use as additional capital so that she could continue to save up for the future of her children and to buy more goods for her general store. Gilla B. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\") woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She lives in Tanjay City, Negros Oriental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 40,000.

She sells prepared foods, soft drinks, and alcoholic drinks. She also offers her clientele other products such as shoes and clothing. Her business experience started in 1992 with the sale of lunch foods in the municipality of Salgar, on the ocean's coast, and some other merchandise. Later she moved to La Playa, where she still lives today with her common-law partner, and she relocated her business to this location. There she has managed to strengthen it and she is so keen that all of her efforts are invested towards its development. But she needs working capital to achieve her goal. Her clients seek her out for the delicious recipes she uses in preparing her foods. Her husband helps her with the business and she has an employee who helps in the kitchen. Her primary clients are the fare collectors and bus drivers and the many passers-by that travel to this community with many businesses. Her Kiva loan is the first loan which she accesses through Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner). With it she will purchase been in larger quantities and ingredients to prepare her lunch foods. She will also invest in merchandise requested by her clients, such as shoes and hand bags. Her greatest dreams are to provide her children with a quality education, to make improvement to her home, and to improve the wellbeing of her family. While this happens, Maria strives to achieve her goal by working persistently to earn a profit of no less than 44.8%. She plans to gradually increase it by acquiring capital funds, such as the one granted by Fundacion Santo Domingo (Kiva Field Partner)."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":800734,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Catering","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase beer in larger quantities and ingredients to prepare foods.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Corregimiento la Playa-Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-07-04T13:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Auxiliadora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62095},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":74530},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75958},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":77414},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":78898},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":80410},{"due_date":"2012-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":81951},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83522},{"due_date":"2012-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":85123},{"due_date":"2012-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":100099}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.93},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.92},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.73},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.54},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.38},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.23},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.1},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.98},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.88},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.31}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":34.93,"local_amount":62095,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:20Z","rounded_local_amount":62235.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320452},{"amount":41.92,"local_amount":74530,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:14Z","rounded_local_amount":74698.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803567},{"amount":86.27,"local_amount":153372,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":153719.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779944},{"amount":89.61,"local_amount":159308,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:29Z","rounded_local_amount":159668.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038621},{"amount":93.08,"local_amount":165473,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":165847.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276650798},{"amount":104.19,"local_amount":185222,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T16:00:58Z","rounded_local_amount":185641.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283140414}],"funded_date":"2011-07-07T01:18:03Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T16:00:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":315954,"name":"Everlyne","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Everlyne is 36 years old and married to a businessman.

She is married and has four sons and one daughter. Her husband is a worker with a decent salary, and two of her sons are municipality employees with decent salaries. \r\n\r\nNa'eema has a store for selling agriculture tools and supplies. She wants to purchase more of these tools and supplies to sell, to increase her income and share with her family to cover their living expenses. Na'eema hasn't enough money to pay, so she needs to take out a loan from FATEN. When Na'eema gets the loan, to be repaid on a monthly basis, she will be able to pay for a large number of farm tools and supplies. This will increase her income and offer better living conditions for her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About this loan product:<\/b>\r\nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

merchandise at once. She bought women's sports suites and pants for the autumn and winter, as well as cardigans, women's shoes for the fall and two wedding gowns (custom ordered). Thanks to the previous loan Monika's inventory has grown, but a lot of the merchandise from the summer is still left which she cannot sell right now. This way partial profit is locked in the merchandise until the next season. Monika hopes that this winter season will be better than the summer one and she will be able to get additional profit and improve her living

She lives with Henry and their five children ages 7, 6, 4, 2, and 2 months. They live in their own home in the native community of San Pablo, in the Pichanaki district, Chanchamayo province. Doris is an expert in coffee growing. On her land, she only sows the crops that are most in demand in the area.\nShe and Henry divide their time between the fields, housework, and taking care of their children. Doris has already recovered from her last birth, and the courage and strength that so define her have allowed her to keep working, caring for their coffee plantations.\n\"The harvest is good in May and June because the price of coffee goes up to 14 Soles per unit, and we sometimes sell it by the bag, 60 or 70 kilos,\" she says. She adds that the buyers do not always go to her community to buy her products. She often has to invest in transporting her harvest to the city of Pichanaki.\nShe hopes that her family does well in everything. In order to ensure this, she will keep working in order to give her children the necessary quality of life so that they can live comfortably without any lack. This will be Doris' first loan with MFP, and she is excited about it. She is now part of the \u201cLos Norionkis de Alto San Pablo\u201d communal bank, and she has high hopes for it.\nWith this money, she will be able to pay the labourers whom she will hire to clear their lands. The undergrowth and weeds are abundant, so she has to clear her land constantly. She will pay 30 Soles per day per labourer."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":972416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire labourers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2012-01-03T17:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1011,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455395}],"funded_date":"2012-01-03T21:14:25Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":381551,"name":"Madona Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Halima is in her late 30s and is a widow with three children.

Many men are also in this occupation. Like is done by  Gusti Ketut Sumantri, who since married to Ni Komang Sunistri has been in the pig farming business. Difficulties in finding work forced Sumantri who only finished 9th grade to create his own field of employment. His choice to be pig farmer came from his minimum capital of only Rp500,000 (about US$55). Initially his profit was minimal, only Rp75,000 (about $8)\/month from his 2 piogs. This does not stop his hope to expand the business. From his wife support and requirements as head of household who has to raise 2 children, who now go to Grade school, Sumantri is encouranged to add his raised animals. With a loan of Rp 1,500,000 (about $165) from Dinari Sumantri now raise 4 piglets, and 1 mother pig. His profit increased. Because besides raising piglets, Sumantri could sell feedstock to people nearby. In 6 months Sumantri could sell Rp5,000,000 (about $550), with a profit of Rp3,500,000 (about $385)\/6 months or Rp550,000 (about $60)\/month.

Tidak sedikit kaum laki-laki juga menekuni usaha ini. Seperti apa yang  dilakukan oleh I Gusti Ketut Sumantri yang sejak menikahi Ni Komang Sunistri telah menekuni beternak babi .  Sulitnya mencari pekerjaan membuat Sumantri yang hanya lulusan SMP ini , bertekad untuk menciptakan lapangan kerja sendiri.

Tapi hal itu tak memupus harapannya untuk mengembangkan usahanya itu. Dengan dorongan dari istri dan juga tuntutan sebagai kepala keluarga yang harus menanggung 2 orang anaknya yang sekarang sudah duduk di bangku sekolah dasar, Sumantri bertambah semangat untuk menambah ternak peliharaanya . Dengan  pinjaman modal dari Dinari Rp 1.500.000.- Sumantri kini memelihara 4 ekor ternak babi penggemukan dan telah mempunyai 1 ekor induk babi.  Keuntungan yang di peroleh Sumantri pun kini berlipat ganda . Karena disamping memelihara penggemukan, Sumantri juga telah bisa menyediakan bibit untuk warga disekitarnya. Dalam enam bulan hasil produksi Sumantri sekarang mencapai Rp 5 .000.000.-  dengan ke untungan bersih Rp. 3.500.000.-  6 bln atau Rp. 550.000.- \/ bulan .

from Tanzania! This is twenty-five-year-old Rahabu from Dar es Salaam, who is married and has a toddler. She also takes care of a sixteen-year-old relative who is an orphan. Rahabu owns and, with the help of an employee, runs a small store from which she sells essential grocery items. The Swahili word for this type of outside shop, or stall, is genge. <P>A genge is usually a very basic structure made of wood, with a tin roof, which sells general items such as onions, tomatoes, chilli, oil, rice, and dried fish. It is the kind of place local people send their children running to fetch something when they are in the middle of cooking the evening meal, and don\u2019t have time to go all the way to the market to buy the missing ingredient. <P>This is Rahabu\u2019s second loan with SELFINA; she has already successfully paid off a loan of US$ 275. This time she is requesting a loan of US$ 525 in order to buy her wares in bulk. She hopes to retail these for a profit.\r\n\r\n<P>Rahabu is a perfect example of why microfinance works and why the large majority of clients repay their loans. A lot of people who hear about microfinance (or Kiva.org) for the first time, ask anxiously, \u201cBut how do you make sure people pay back? Won\u2019t they just take the money?\u201d The implication is that the clientele who access microfinance (usually 'the poor\u2019) are less trustworthy, efficient or educated than \u2018ordinary\u2019 people. <P>Whether or not this is true is somewhat irrelevant, for a number of reasons. Firstly, most MFIs have due diligence processes in place to assess client risk, as well as measures such as collateral arrangements and group lending (where a defaulted loan is borne by the group as a whole) to address this risk. More important than any of these deterrents, however, is an incentive. The incentive clients have to start a business, build a business, and repay their loan so that they can get another and another and another\u2026The incentive is having on-going access to financial services from which they had previously been excluded.\r\n\r\n<P>SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. <P>Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence the poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. <P>The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":191866,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase supplies in bulk for her stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T00:30:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rahabu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T03:10:20Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53,"local_amount":60571.43,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:49Z","rounded_local_amount":61639,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356200},{"amount":52,"local_amount":59428.57,"processed_date":"2008-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:38Z","rounded_local_amount":60476,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347942},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:08:57Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970516},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:24Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886733},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:18Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435993},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:49Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130291},{"amount":52.49,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:10Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027122},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:47Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613162},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:59Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010245},{"amount":52.51,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:47Z","rounded_local_amount":61057.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232556}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T03:10:20Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65176,"name":"Agnes","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Agnes S., a 58-year-old businesswoman is widowed with five children.

In addition to commerce, they also make karit\u00e9 butter and porridge made from millet, beans, etc.  The group is composed of eight women (all married and averaging 40 years of age and four children), who live in polygamous households in the village of Zi\u00e9korodougou, located about 38 km from the city of Sikasso (third administrative region of Mali).  \r\n<p>\r\nHaving collaborated with Soro Yiriwaso for six years now, they are on their eleventh cycle (solidarity loans, i.e., group loans), and all the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  With this loan they intend to buy:  4 sacks of salt, 10 packets of flavorings, 10 kg of cola nuts, 10 kg of smoked fish, 50 kg of karit\u00e9 nuts, 2 sacks of peanuts, 150 kg of beans, 60 kg of millet, and 25 kg of sugar.  The karit\u00e9 nuts are first cooked and then pounded, either with a machine or in the tradition manner, to make karit\u00e9 butter.  The millet is also pounded, winnowed, and cooked to make porridge or couscous out of it.  \r\n<p>\r\nThey get their supplies essentially in the city of Sikasso, the villages of Heremakono (bordering Mali and Burkina Faso) and Koloko (first village of Burkina Faso after Mali).  The merchandise is taken to Heremakono on market days to be sold in cash at the retail level to customers composed  generally of women and especially of market vendors.  Some group members sell their merchandise in Zi\u00e9korodougou on the side of the road that leads to Mali and Burkina Faso.  \r\n<p>\r\nWith this eleventh loan, they each envision realizing an average profit of 10,000 francs CFA per month, which will essentially be used to boost their working capital. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":222767,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy various goods ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-11-06T23:50:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alimatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Afou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nabintou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adjaratou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alimata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sali       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Korotoumou   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":160000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":26666.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":26666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":26666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":26666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":26666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":26666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":26666.67,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T02:47:21Z","rounded_local_amount":27979.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5350980},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":26666.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:28:31Z","rounded_local_amount":27979.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974076},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":26666.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":27979.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889449},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":26666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:12:54Z","rounded_local_amount":27979.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440242},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":26666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:08:50Z","rounded_local_amount":27979.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135610},{"amount":54.15,"local_amount":26666.65,"processed_date":"2009-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:29:35Z","rounded_local_amount":27979.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033411}],"funded_date":"2008-11-08T16:19:09Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:29:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":77477,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth is a member of the Nobleza (\u201cNobility\u201d) Village Bank.

El es un agricultor de mucha trayectoria, junto con su esposa realizan los trabajos agr\u00edcolas, y en todo este tiempo ha acumulado muchas agallas y experiencia, conociendo los meses en que se debe cultivar y abonar. Desde entonces a llegado a la conclusi\u00f3n de que la siembra de pi\u00f1a es muy dificultosa, mientras que los platanales le resultan m\u00e1s f\u00e1ciles. Pero lo que s\u00ed es muy  rentable, pero tambi\u00e9n laborioso es la siembra de caf\u00e9; Daniel no deja de sembrar este producto durante todo el a\u00f1o, invierte mucho, pero tambi\u00e9n gana, por lo cual se siente muy orgulloso de ser agricultor.

He is the father of 6 children and currently lives in his house with his wife and grandson.  He is a farmer with a lot of experience.  Together with his wife, they have worked many agricultural jobs.  Through this work, they accumulated guts and experience, learning which months are good for cultivating and fertilizing.  Since then they've arrived at the conclusion that growing pineapple is very difficult, while growing bananas is easier.  However what is really profitable, though also labor-intensive, is the cultivation of coffee.  Daniel planted this product non-stop throughout the entire year, investing a lot, but also gaining a lot.  This made him feel very proud to be a farmer.  Now he is very happy because the coffee farm he planted last year is already about to bear fruit.  For that reason he wants to complete fertilization of the coffee plants, so that they will be harvested on time and so that in this way he can have an alternate production and will have money to cover his family's expenses.  Daniel and the rest of his coworkers have formed a communal bank called Alto Yapaz, where he has been named treasurer.  He has promised to fulfill his responsibilities as an officer.  He also made a commitment to pay on time to MFP, to which he is grateful for providing this loan.  He is requesting this money to buy fertilizers in order to fertilize his coffee crop, and in this way try to improve production.  He expects that the requested amount will be sufficient.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Morey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":284483,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizer for coffee plants","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-18T23:40:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:25Z","rounded_local_amount":573.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211123}],"funded_date":"2009-03-19T00:56:34Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T16:46:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca Morey","image":null}},{"id":97957,"name":"Gladys","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gladys T. is 50 years old.

In order to help her husband with the household expenses, she decided to start her own business selling clothing and lottery tickets. She sells all types of clothing door to door. She also delivers clothing to people's homes. She says that she sells the clothes on credit and collects every week. This is an advantage, she says, because selling on credit increases the price and she makes more profit. In addition, when she collects, she makes more sales.

Jadi mereka mandi dan mencuci baju di sungai. Rumahnya sekaligus tempat usahanya. Bersama suaminya dia berusaha jualan krupuk. Bu Siti bagian pembuatan, suaminya bagian pemasaran keliling. Keuntungan per hari mereka dapat mencapai Rp 60.000,00. Dengan biaya hidup Rp 30.000,00 per hari, mereka masih bisa menabung. Pinjaman yang dia dapatkan akan digunakan untuk menambah modal usaha. Mereka akan menerima banyak pesanan pada saat bulan puasa. Artinya, modal yang diterimanya bulan ini akan dapat menambah persediaan krupuk yang akan dijualnya. Hal ini tentunya akan menambah keuntungannya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":71513,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase raw materials, cooking oil and cooking fuel","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Badung","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.5 115.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2007-10-04T23:40:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Siti Maryam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-10-19T00:42:16Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":125,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2007-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-11-19T10:25:29Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":83663},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2007-12-19T10:25:50Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99416},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-01-19T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118133},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-02-19T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":138215},{"amount":25,"local_amount":25,"processed_date":"2008-03-19T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-03-19T10:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":161201}],"funded_date":"2007-10-05T00:42:16Z","paid_date":"2008-03-19T10:05:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":24222,"name":"Eduardo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eduardo S. is 32 years old, married and has one son.\r\n<p>\r\nEver since he was a young man, Eduardo has had many different types of jobs.

She lives with her husband and their children in M\u00e9dine, one of the popular areas of the city of Sikasso (third administrative region in the republic of Mali). Having not had the chance to move forward in school for social reasons, she started businesses buying and selling dyed damasks, ginger, bed sheets, shoes, soaps, etc. more than ten years ago. She buys and sews pieces of dyed damask into men's shirts in order to sell them. She is sought after by her clientele, which is comprised of her husband\u2019s neighbors and colleagues, due to the quality of her products. In order to better satisfy her growing clientele, she has decided to turn to microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso for the last five years. After 6 group loans with a neighborhood women\u2019s association (Association BENKADI de M\u00e9dine), she is on her fifth individual loan, and all of her previous loans have been properly repaid.  She plans to use this loan to buy 15 suits of dyed damask, 4 pieces of Wax fabrics, 20 sets of sheets, 2 boxes of soaps, 5 pairs of women\u2019s shoes, etc. She stocks up at Bobo Dioulasso (republic of Burkina Faso) and then sells her stock from home or traveling around the city of Sikasso for cash or credit. She foresees earning 100,000 CFA francs in monthly profit from this loan, which will essentially be used to increase her business, contribute to her family expenses, repay her loan, and reinvest into her business.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sherry W., Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":304527,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy miscellaneous items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:43Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aga\u00efssa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":25000},{"due_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":25000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:39:32Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621247},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:22:06Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020206},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:38Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242960},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:55Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678704},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:56:00Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112575},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:08:56Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028147},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-11-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:22Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873519},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2009-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:02:39Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763263},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:05Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152071},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":25000,"processed_date":"2010-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":26048.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123990996}],"funded_date":"2009-05-03T16:17:49Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry W.","image":null}},{"id":106165,"name":"Petronila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Petronila is married to Jessie T. who works as a tricycle driver in their village.

She is 34 years old. Juliet is married and has four school-aged children. To make a living, Juliet owns & operates a business venture in the services sector operating a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from providing cargo transport services to local community members. Juliet has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Juliet joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Juliet has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. Juliet is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to invest in renovating the business. This loan will be the 3rd loan taken out by Juliet from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of the her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting fruits & vegetables for sale.  Sefulu has 3 years of experience in this business.  Sefulu needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 280 talas or US $117 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sefulu joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Sefulu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Since she was very young, she has worked hard for the well-being of her family and has had a variety of jobs.  Currently she sells condiments.  This business generates the necessary economic income for her to provide a high quality of life to her family.  She offers these condiments in a market that is near the area where she lives.  She prepares various sauces and spices like ocopa (a spicy sauce made of peanuts, chili peppers, and herbs), chili sauces, ground garlic, and others.  The housewives in the area prefer her and frequently acquire their sauces from her to prepare their food quickly.\r\n\r\nShe also sells various beauty products by catalog to her friends and people she knows.  In the future, she wants to establish a more stable business and to administer it from her home.  She feels at peace with her jobs because she wants to get ahead little by little.

Every morning she wakes up very early to drive to her fields to tend her coffee plants. She does this with her husband, and they have been working in agriculture for 8 years. What she likes most is to have high-quality crops because this means that her crops can be sold quickly and get good prices. However, it is difficult to move their crop to the different markets where they are sold as they are very delicate. Because her job is profitable, she has been able to build her own house and buy some agricultural land that brings her good profits, and she is very proud of these achievements.

She earns her living by operating a business venture to buy and sell scrap gold. Her husband Falconiere G., who is 54 years old, works as a welder to earn his living. They have 2 children who are 31 and 34 years old. Rebecca joined NWTF- Project Dungganon in 2004 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 4 loans from NWTF- Project Dungganon, Rebecca has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing PHP 11,000 which she intends to use as additional capital for the business so that she can continue to save up for the future and to support the maintenance of the family.  Rebecca G. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. Her photo was taken during the end of her weekly center meeting because her scrap gold was already sold.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon- a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her partner with whom she has a 3 year old daughter. They live in their own home where they share the happiness of educating and bringing up their daughter and they put forth all their strength and make the necessary sacrifices in order to provide her a good quality of life.\r\n\r\nElena\u2019s work consists of selling sweets and products that children enjoy eating. She has a stand where she sells her sweets. It is located in one of the busiest parks in the city. Her day normally begins at 8:00AM in the morning and finishes at 6:00PM in the afternoon. During this time she takes advantage of any moments when sales are low to go see her daughter who is still very young and needs a lot of attention. It is one of the things that complicate her work, but too it is something that she knows will soon pass, as each day her daughter grows a bit more.\r\n\r\nThe thing that she like most about her work is the freedom that she has to do other activities at the same time she is at her sweet stand. She has been doing this for three years and what she considers the most difficult thing about her work is having to be under the relentless sun all day. She hopes that with time she will be able to have a store where she can serve her clients better. \r\n\r\nThis will be her 7th loan with MFP. She has always been a good member of the communal bank which she likes very much because of the care and unity.

Meshark works as a subsistence farmer for a living. His community of Koogo Kochieng village does not have access to clean water. The water that is used for drinking and cooking is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne disease. Meshark is a friendly member of the community, and has been elected promoter by his village to help its members obtain safe drinking water.\n\nAs a volunteer Promoter, Meshark represents the community on Kiva\u2019s website and educates the community on how to protect their families from unsafe drinking water by using a chlorine dispenser system. Meshark and two other promoters in his community, namely Lonna and Emily, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Meshark wants to be a promoter because he believes that the dispenser system will help treat water making it safe and preventing water-borne diseases in the community.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Meshark\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1803562,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To allow the community to treat their water to make it safe to drink using chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Meshark ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lonna ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emily ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1350,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":337.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":992934,"name":"Raban","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Raban is a farmer rearing chicken and goats.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Before, she and her husband are partners in their business the bamboo set making. But considering their age, the business is quite tiring and laborious. When she received her first loan from ASHI, she constructed a fish cage in the lake. That was four years ago already. Now her business is getting bigger and brings her good income.\nNow on her 4th loan, she proposes a loan of 18,000 pesos as additional capital for her fish cage business. The loan will be used to pay for 2 fish cages, renovation and repair of her other fish cages, 30 pieces of bamboos and labor expenses.\nShe is looking forward that with the trend of fishing as main source of income in the island is in demand; her business will grow and will bring her enough income for her family.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

To that end, NWTF offers green energy products designed to save money for its clients. In a partnership with SunTransfer and Arc Finance, NWTF distributes solar-powered lanterns that also function as a charging station for mobile phones. Since many families normally use kerosene lamps to light their homes, the solar lantern offers a free, environment-friendly renewable source of energy, that allows them to reduce their monthly fuel costs.   \r\n\t\t\r\nAbout NWTF\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She owns a business, planting and harvesting taro for sale.  Senia has 5 years of experience in this business.  Senia needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase weed-killers such as Gramoxome.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 650 talas or US $271 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nThis is Senia's third loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Senia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Besides repaying the loan, the group members use part of their revenues to meet family expenses. \u00a0In the days to come, the women plan on obtaining bigger loans to expand their businesses.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":549235,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buying ingredients to make beignets ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Tominian ","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-06-06T02:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sabine ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatouma ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Virginie ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bah ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":33477.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961611},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:31Z","rounded_local_amount":33477.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699735},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:12Z","rounded_local_amount":33477.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913636},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":33477.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180773},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:51Z","rounded_local_amount":33477.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476741},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":33477.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182613451}],"funded_date":"2010-06-06T16:54:20Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:40:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":209459,"name":"Joffre Alberto","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Joffre de 29 a\u00f1os, vive en las Orqu\u00eddeas de Guayaquil, su casa es de cemento aun no terminada de construir,  solo cuenta con alcantarillado y luz como servicios basicos, el es guardia de seguridad y tiene una ni\u00f1a de tres a\u00f1os.\n\nJoffre  se caso muy joven y tuvo que trabajar y ya no seguir estudiando para darles una mejor viva a su familia, pero como los ingresos de el no superan el presupuesto que tiene para construir su casa el quiere comprar con el pr\u00e9stamo cemento, bloques y hierros para que su esposa e hija puedan vivir en mejores condiciones. \n\nEl quiere un buen futuro para su familia, y tiene pensado en un futuro independizarse y tener su propio negocio para asegurar el futuro de su familia. \n","en":"\r\nJoffre, 29, lives in Las Orqu\u00eddeas, Guayaquil, in a concrete house that is still unfinished; the only utilities it has are electricity and sewage.

She is one of the leading fabrics vendors in the market where she works. She is very determined in all of her business endeavors, which has helped to sustain her venture for eight years. Gulchehra is a skilled entrepreneur. When she started this trade, she decided to implement basic concepts of integrity and hard work in her business to reach ultimate success. This laid a firm foundation for winning results and Gulchehra has obviously been a successful small entrepreneur. However, she doesn\u2019t want to stop.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

After high school, without financial support, she began to help her mother to sell baby clothes at the market in 1995, and got a taste for it.  Since then, her chance presented itself when she found some money, and she too began a business selling baby clothes in 2000 with a starting capital of 10,000 frs.  With this loan, she wants to strengthen her business by buying dozens of bedtime clothes, knitted goods, bibs, baby's tops, covers, pacifiers, bed linens, powder and other necessaries.  She has a daily receipt of between 20,000 and 35,000 frs.  Her clients are pregnant women who frequent the market, despite difficulties arising from a break-down in the supply of merchandise from her providers.  Her strategy is to have a large variety of merchandise, to create a good reception area, to have a good window display in order to better satisfy the needs of her client\u00e8le.  She would like to have a boutique in the future and to be a wholesaler, as well as to make journeys to buy merchandise and to improve her children's schooling conditions.
