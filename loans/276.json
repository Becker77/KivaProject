The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":285290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase salts, wheat flour, biscuits and cooking oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-09T20:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:54Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027603},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613604},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:37Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010683},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:12Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232969},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:20Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664760},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105476},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022621},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867870},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:31Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757071},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-01-17T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:26Z","rounded_local_amount":52080,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146183}],"funded_date":"2009-03-10T01:12:27Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Adam Sutcliffe","image":null}},{"id":98085,"name":"Apu Curi - Quiquijana Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nEste banco comunal denominado \u201cAPU CURI - QUIQUIJANA\u201d;

Paute is a tourist area in the province of Azuay, characterized by its tropical climate, green spaces, plantations, sugar cane fields and a variety of fruit produced by its inhabitants.  The members of the communal bank are business owners who sell different products in the market such as fruit, vegetables, meats, prepared meals, and other items. These women are very kind, respectful, organized, and they work well with one another.  \r\n<p>\r\nMercedes is 45 years old, in a common law marriage, and has 3 children.  Her oldest child attends high school in Paute.  Mercedes could only afford to finish elementary school, in contrast to her partner who completed two years of college.  Living in a house full of people who are willing to work and help with her business, she is thankful to God for the family that she has.  Mercedes has been working at her bakery for quite some time, approximately 7 years.  Her loan of $330 will be invested into her business.  She works a schedule of 11-12 hours, 5 days a week.  Mercedes earns about $20 each week selling bread, which helps tremendously because her family gets to keep the bread that is not sold as a result of competition.  This is her first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR.  She was invited by her friends to join the group.  Her goal for the future is to acquire a location for her bakery since she currently makes bread from home.  Mercedes says this will help her to market her bread, along with cakes, pastries, desserts and other delicacies.\r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda is a native of Cuenca and lives in the neighborhood of San Jos\u00e9 de Balsay.

Her sales double during the holidays, and also on Wednesdays and Sundays.  Her work schedule is from 9am to 3pm, Monday through Sunday.  She will use her loan of $330 to purchase chicks and raise them until they are ready for sale.    Mar\u00eda is a longtime member, but became inactive for a year because of the distance and her decision to work with another group based in Cuenca.  Her goal is to own a large chicken hatchery and purchase equipment for plucking.  \r\n<p>\r\nDiana is a native of Paute and lives in the neighborhood of Solidaridad.

When these items are harvested she brings them to the wholesale market to sell. In this way she is able to make money to support her family.

She is separated and lives with her 13 year old daughter in an apartment in Barranquilla. For three years she has been selling merchandise such as women's outerwear, bags, wallets, creams and silver accessories. Her selling experience began more than thirty years ago when she began selling candy at high school to pay for her textbooks. Recently, Daisy has been distributing a line of women's underwear that they send her from the city of Medell\u00edn and it has been very popular, especially with young women because they are pieces adorned with lace and embroidery that give them a sexy and feminie look.  Daisy's clientele is made up of friends, neighbors, relatives and referrals to whom she gives up to 60 days to pay her in two, three, or four payments.   \r\n\r\nThis is the first loan that Daisy has taken out with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation and she will invest it in buying merchandise and paying for it upfront in quantities that will mean significant discounts for her. In the future, her plans are to open a small store in a mall to offer her products and connect with new customers who will pay up front. With pride and happiness,  Daisy affirms that \"by selling merchandise\" she has been able to finance her young daughter's high school education at one of the best private high schools in the city. This shows how important her work has been for her family. Her dream for the future are to also be able to finance her university studies because according to her, the best legacy a parent can leave a child is a good education based in Christian values.

Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Thi Nhi, 44 years old, joined the TYM Fund in 2007. Her first loan of 3,000,000VND (about 200USD) was used to invest in doing business and raising livestock. Her business of supplying fresh eels, snakes and frogs for restaurants brings about a high profit of 200,000VND (about 13USD) each day. Apart from doing business, her family also invests in rearing pigs. Currently, she has 8 pigs, so each year she sells out an average of 2 tonnes of pigs, earning high profit. This time, she would like to borrow 9,000,000VND (550.00USD) to invest in rearing pigs.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":248292,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional shoes, sandals and slippers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-29T21:40:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Navoneiwa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":116666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:14:54Z","rounded_local_amount":119991.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14887066},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:03:46Z","rounded_local_amount":119991.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436349},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":119991.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130621},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:03Z","rounded_local_amount":119991.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027418},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":116666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":119991.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613419},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":116666.65,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":119991.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010499}],"funded_date":"2008-12-30T00:44:08Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":85813,"name":"Idoyatullo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Idoyatullo is 34 years old.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her spouse and children, Cristhian  and Diego, who are 7 and 2, respectively. They live together in the Peruvian jungle, located in the community of Sirenachayocc, where they have their own house. Yolanda remembers that she she started as a teenager in her parents field. She began to spend most of her time planting and harvesting cacao and coffee and that is how she saw that cacao is in high demand nationally and internationally. That is why she began to become independent from her parents, not befO. thanking them for the lessons they had taught her. At present, she produces cacao in large quantities, generating a good income. She tries to be careful of the diseases that can affect that product. At times she receives help from her spouse, but at harvest time she needs help from laborers who can facilitate the extraction of her product efficiently and effectively. Usually, she sells her product at the stockpiler's in her own community at a reasonable price. Her greatest wish is to have a grocery stO. with the purpose of having extra income, since her product is seasonal and this will help her family's quality of life. This is her second loan with MFP. She is committed to making the payments according to schedule. She also likes to work with her communal group since everyone supports each other. With the loan she is asking for, she will maintain her caco crops, acquiring materials and fertilizer, in order to improve her production.   \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":549487,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizer and materials to improve the cacao production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-07T10:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166.23},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":179.07},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":181.23},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":187.84},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":196.23},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":203.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":211.39},{"due_date":"2011-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":216.99},{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":225.46},{"due_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":232.4}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.18},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.68},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.43},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.74},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.68},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.11},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.98},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":75.95},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.91},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.18,"local_amount":166.23,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:57Z","rounded_local_amount":166.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934596},{"amount":62.68,"local_amount":179.07,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:06Z","rounded_local_amount":179.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673367},{"amount":63.43,"local_amount":181.23,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":181.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887191},{"amount":65.74,"local_amount":187.84,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:24Z","rounded_local_amount":188.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154203},{"amount":68.68,"local_amount":196.23,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":196.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449512},{"amount":71.11,"local_amount":203.16,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":203.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588192},{"amount":73.98,"local_amount":211.39,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:31Z","rounded_local_amount":212.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724739},{"amount":75.95,"local_amount":216.99,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:06Z","rounded_local_amount":217.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191462951},{"amount":78.91,"local_amount":225.46,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":226.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886464},{"amount":81.34,"local_amount":232.4,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:10Z","rounded_local_amount":233.24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327846}],"funded_date":"2010-06-07T22:13:46Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":209571,"name":"Thol's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Five members who live in Kor village in Takeo province make up this group loan.

She was born in the Jaramijo province of Manab\u00ed, a county on the banks of the Pacific Ocean.   Years ago, Dolores' husband was a fisherman, but he later decided to change his occupation and currently is a driver.   \r\n<p>\r\n Dolores told us that when her husband left on a fishing trip she suffered greatly knowing that he was risking his life, but now she is calmer because he works nearby and shares in their family life.  \r\n<p>\r\nDolores is a hard worker, and loves to devote herself completely to helping out at home, but she also enjoys great challenges and decided to use some space in her home to start a small business.\r\n<p>\r\nFrom a positive point of view, Dolores made the decision to invest a small amount of money into her own business, which consists of the sale of spare tires and after market automotive accessories.  Since, in the place where Dolores lives, most people make their living from fishing, there are very few places where one can find these spare tires. \r\n<p>\r\nDolores emotionally tells us that since she started this business 8 months ago, it has been going very well.   The little money she has made so far, she has reinvested in her business, purchasing headlights, water pumps, starters and more.  \r\n<p>\r\nWhen asked about her motives for requesting a loan, Dolores responded, \" I hope that with this money I can increase my business and invest in more spare parts.

He lives with his parents and sister in a large house.\r\nDespite his young age he has learned to concentrate on business and is expected to grow economically. He already owns two motorcycle taxis - one of them he drives himself and the other he rents to someone he knows. For the past 7 years he has done this every day, with no holidays or weekends off, because he wants to get ahead and knows that with sacrifice he will make it.\r\nHis earnings are net profits with which he helps his parents. The business is very profitable because the motorcycle taxi service is very much in demand where he lives, and since he is well known his service is trusted. In the future Jorge would like to have a fleet of motorcycle taxis and rent them out to grow even more. At 23 years old he has accomplished a lot, which makes his parents proud, and he will not stop until he has achieved all his goals.\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP and it is expected that, once again, he will be as responsible as with his first loan. He wants to keep working responsibly to progress and has his whole life ahead of him. The loan he is requesting will be used to buy a new motorcycle taxk as well as repair ther other two he has, because he knows that in business as you earn you must also invest.\r\n<br

She buys Capiz shells and makes them into different crafts and sells them in the market. So far, their business has been so successful that it has opened up new opportunities to venture into other businesses. Aside from shell crafting, they also have rooms for rent and a food vending stand. Through their profits they were able to acquire a piece of land and renovate their house. \r\n\r\nZita has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for four years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow 15 times in CCT\u2019s Credit Cooperative. The reason why she was consistent in paying her loans was because she used almost all of the money she borrowed to buy Capiz shells for their business.\r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan. This amount will be mostly used to buy more Capiz shells to make more crafts and, thus, more profits.\r\n\r\nShe dreams of seeing her children with their own jobs someday.   \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The 45-year-old mother is a small-holder farmer based in Omobera village, in the Nyanza region of Kenya. For the past 10 years, the primary-educated entrepreneur has run a mixed farm, where she keeps productive dairy cows that produce milk for both consumption and sale. Florence farms on a two-acre piece of land that belongs to her husband, whose professional activities have little to do with agriculture. Florence was farming for subsistence, but recently switched to commercial production. The income she made from this transition greatly improved her income status and enabled her to afford her children a better education. Florence is seeking a loan to purchase animal feed. She places more premium on animal health and nutrition in her dairy business than on other factors. Animal feed has a lot to do with the proper composition of the animal products she sells to her customers. She is seeking this loan to ensure that her animals have the proper feed composition that they require. The returns from this investment will enable Florence to pay for her children's education expenses. She wants nothing but the best foundation for her children's

R.. whose business is similar, and Clara Rosa M., the group's coordinator who supports herself by handcrafting clothing. \r\n\r\nDo\u00f1a Ver\u00f3nica del Socorro F. sells meat from her home. She has been working in this business for more than 5 years. She has gone through difficult times, including moments when she was about to close the business. With the loan that Adim gave her, she has succeeded in buying  her products wholesale. As a result she is now able to compete on price with other butcher shops. \r\n\r\nShe is married, and has an adolescent son who helps her sell her products. Her husband helps cover household expenses with his own work. She hopes to be able to grow her business and to reach her goal of improving her home. Veronica comments that the Adim training she has received has taught her to better control her business and to improve herself as a person, as well.\r\n\r\nThe group plans to work the Adim through several cycles. All of the members are clear that they will be able to do so only if they are disciplined about their payments. The group has already received 4 loans; all of the members have imrproved their quality of life as a result.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erin Corcoran, Kiva

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nJovelyn is married and has 2 school-aged children. To make a living, Jovelyn owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Jovelyn has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Jovelyn joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jovelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Jovelyn is requesting a new loan of 13000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 11th loan taken out by Jovelyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of the children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

has been selling clothes and shoes for 9 years. Before opening his own business he taught tennis at a local academy where he used to practice with his friend in his free time. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Cesar was happy with his job, as time passed he decided to leave the tennis academy so that he could dedicate his life to the teachings of Christ.  He began preaching at a local penitentiary to the inmates and prison guards, and one day an inmate was admiring the pants he was wearing, and asked him to sell them to him.  At this moment, Cesar realized that even inside the prison system there existed a market for the sale of merchandise.   He began to bring goods-clothes, shoes, and accessories- with him when he visited the prison, and little by little he established his business.  Cesar now visits the prison three days a week, on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. He is able to both preach, and make a living. In addition, he has two inmates who help him with his business on the weekends, when the demand is highest.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cesar would like a loan so that he can invest in more merchandise as he has reached a point where the demand for his products outweighs what he is able to supply.  He would also like to expand his business to another area of the prison system, but has not been able to yet due to a lack of capital.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cesar is 40 years old, and has three children who are in school, and help him with the business in their spare time.  He is married, and his wife is a nurse.  Cesar owns a motorcycle, but would like to buy a car one day to help him transport his goods.  He is confident in his business skills, and he knows that with the help of those around him he will continue to succeed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Michelle Kreger, a Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cesar tiene una experiencia de 9 a\u00f1os en la venta de ropa y zapatos.

Her mother-in-law brought her to the village bank, and with her very first microloan, Fanny began a Nintendo arcade. She slowly accumulated televisions and gaming systems, and before she knew it, she was able to provide toys and a bed for her new baby son. As she is always looking for the best way to increase her business, Fanny recognized the need for internet in her community and decided to change gears and open an internet caf\u00e9. She sold her televisions and together with the profits, with the money she had been saving in the bank, and with her loans, she bought 7 computers and opened her new business. It continued to grow, and today, she and her husband run a beautiful and very busy internet caf\u00e9 with 12 computers, a new television for playing movies, and a large display of candy for her patrons to snack on.  All the neighborhood children pass in and out of her doors throughout the day, playing video games, meeting friends, and learning from the limitless resources the internet has to offer.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a professional goal, Fanny and her husband hope to buy the property next door and expand the internet caf\u00e9 to allow more computers and more customers.

With the profit, she hopes to fix the roof of her house, which has been affected by the winter season that is currently battering the country. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Mar\u00eda Cecilia dreams of having a large corral with many pigs, in order to achieve the peace of mind generated by having a solid business.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":667184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy pigs to raise ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Yarumal","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":177,"posted_date":"2010-12-16T22:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Cecilia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":166667},{"due_date":"2011-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":166665}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.66},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:18:23Z","rounded_local_amount":174148.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191449842},{"amount":91.66,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:57:18Z","rounded_local_amount":174148.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195871852},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:25:11Z","rounded_local_amount":174148.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201312787},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":166667,"processed_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:22:47Z","rounded_local_amount":174148.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206182129},{"amount":183.33,"local_amount":333332,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:35:48Z","rounded_local_amount":348295.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211255513}],"funded_date":"2010-12-17T02:17:59Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:35:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cynthia McMurry","image":924798}},{"id":262890,"name":"Flora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Flora N. is a farmer from the town of Nkubu in eastern Kenya.

employees, and improve the flooring, which is not of appropriate material for the advancement of the micro-business. \n\nD\u00e1lida dreams of one day being able to generate more employment, and of

She is 38 years old, a shop owner and has 5 children, two of whom are still in secondary school.  Her other children live independently from her.  Her husband works in the mayor's office of Totogalpa, municipality of Le\u00f3n.  Rosalba was a homemaker, but she needed to help her husband with the household expenses.  In addition, she wanted a business that would allow her to be independent and earn her own money but at the same time to take care of her children.  And so her husband helped her to open a small grocery, which Rosalba has now had for 4 years.  Her younger children help her in the store after school, which allows her to go out to purchase merchandise to stock her store.  In addition to running the store, Rosalba sells clothing, shoes and cosmetics from a street stand as well as in her store.  Little by little she has been growing her business and contributing financially to their household.  Rosalba needs the loan to purchase clothing, shoes, cosmetics, basic grain inventory, canned goods, candies, milk, juice, soda and cleaning agents.  The loan will help her to stock up her grocery and to purchase general merchandise to sell.  Her next goal is to open a clothing store and to purchase display cases and mannequins to display the clothing."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":899492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to purchase clothing, shoes, cosmetics, basic grain inventory, canned goods, candies, milk, juice, sodas and cleaning agents.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2011-10-19T23:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosalba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":439.73,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":36.69},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64},{"due_date":"2012-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36.64}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.55},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.49},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.49},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.49},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.49},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.49},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.55,"local_amount":36.69,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-16T09:03:56Z","rounded_local_amount":37.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244770102},{"amount":37.49,"local_amount":36.64,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:47:35Z","rounded_local_amount":37.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250832666},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":36.64,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:15:40Z","rounded_local_amount":37.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257242586},{"amount":37.49,"local_amount":36.64,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:23Z","rounded_local_amount":37.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263381859},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":36.64,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:26:13Z","rounded_local_amount":37.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270095401},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":36.64,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:27:41Z","rounded_local_amount":37.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276710032},{"amount":37.49,"local_amount":36.64,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":37.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283403471},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":36.64,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:47:09Z","rounded_local_amount":37.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287428427},{"amount":149.98,"local_amount":146.56,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T09:06:11Z","rounded_local_amount":149.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294613163}],"funded_date":"2011-11-14T02:17:05Z","paid_date":"2012-08-16T09:06:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marni Siegal","image":829283}},{"id":353078,"name":"Sadek","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This borrower is from Iraq.
