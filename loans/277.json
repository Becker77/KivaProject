When the walls are built they'll have the security to obtain a patrimony. Their house is made of planks and zinc, and it's not very safe. Esperanza has started the wall and would like to finish it, because it is important to her family to be safe from crime.

She and her husband have 4 daughters who attend high school.  Elia sells river fish of all varieties and sizes from her post in the informal market.  Her work schedule runs from 6am to 11am and she has been doing this for the past 9 years.  Occasionally one of her daughters will come with her to help tend to the customers.  What she likes most about her job is that she gets to sell and take good care of people, especially her regular clients.  In addition, her business is very profitable because she earns a daily income and gets better returns because she buys her fish directly from the river port at a lower price.  Elia\u2019s business is doing very well and sometime later she wants to export her product to other places that have not experienced the taste of freshwater fish.  \r\n<p>\r\nElia already has 8 previous loans with MFP.  She loves working with her Communal Bank because all the members are punctual with their payments and understand one another.  She will designate 500 soles to purchase more fish.

Married to M. B., a government employee, they are blessed with five children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life.  She has been into managing a variety store for quite some time now. She mainly buys and sells basic commodities like groceries, rice and the like to her neighbors.\r\n\r\nLeila has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow 10 times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her business.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 13,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying more stock to be incorporated into her current product inventory.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":525416,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Danilo has been engaged in his business for over 15 years and earns approximately 3500 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Danilo joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Danilo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase breeding livestock. Danilo is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This loan will be his third loan from ASKI. He plans to use the additional revenue to financially support immediate members of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband Edno, who is 46 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have six children who are between 6 and 26 years old. Helina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2006 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past eight loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Helina has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her ninth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 to buy stock for her sari-sari (general) store so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Mrs. Sokhom S. is 29 years old and the mother of three children, one of whom is attending the local school, while the others are too young to work or study because they are four and five years old. Her husband is presented on the right in the photo.

vida de sus padres, que son de edad avanzada. Por otro lado este negocio es de mucha ayuda para los vecinos de su caser\u00edo, ya que este queda muy alejado del pueblo y ellos no tienen alimentos de primera necesidad al alcance de la mano.\n\nDebido a que la mayor\u00eda de vecinos de la zona son agricultores y reciben sus pagos los fines de semana ella ofrece sus productos al cr\u00e9dito y al contado. Este sistema esta teniendo mucha acogida, asi que Rosaura desea ampliar su negocio, por este motivo se encuentra solicitando a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1500 nuevos soles que piensa invertir en la compra de mas verduras y menestras.\n\nElla es una mujer bastante conocida por los vecinos de su zona, ellos la consideran una mujer trabajadora, responsable y de confianza.

This business was born out of Rosaura's need to earn a living to help support her family and look after her parents' quality of life, as they are elderly. Concurrently, this business also helps her neighbors in the settlement since the city is far away and they do not have basic need items at hand. <p> \r\nBecause the majority of the residents are farmers and receive their pay at the end of the week, she accepts both cash and credit for her goods. This system is having much success, so Rosaura would like to expand her business. For this reason, she is requesting a 1,500.00 PEN loan from Edpyme Alternativa, which she will invest in purchasing pulses and vegetables. <p>\r\nRosaura is very well-known by her neighbors, who consider her to be a hardworking, responsible and trustworthy woman. Her greatest wish is to give her parents a better quality of life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":507852,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase pulses and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Quemaz\u00f3n - M\u00f3rrope - Lambayeque","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":143,"posted_date":"2010-03-18T22:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosaura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":103.47},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":108.43},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":107.74},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":117.96},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":118.06},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":120.98},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":127.82},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":130.3},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":134.65},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":139.6},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":143.16},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":147.83}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.76},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.25},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.29},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.87},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":47.78},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":49.37},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":51.18},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.94,"local_amount":103.47,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":107.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136662326},{"amount":39.76,"local_amount":108.43,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:07:14Z","rounded_local_amount":112.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144695030},{"amount":39.5,"local_amount":107.74,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:38:26Z","rounded_local_amount":111.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151878075},{"amount":43.25,"local_amount":117.96,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T10:51:01Z","rounded_local_amount":122.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159618103},{"amount":43.29,"local_amount":118.06,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:02:04Z","rounded_local_amount":122.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166832505},{"amount":44.36,"local_amount":120.98,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:56:45Z","rounded_local_amount":125.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172099111},{"amount":301.9,"local_amount":823.36,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-16T10:42:24Z","rounded_local_amount":851.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177554552}],"funded_date":"2010-03-19T12:33:14Z","paid_date":"2010-11-16T10:42:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":189555,"name":"Teresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresa, 48, sells charcoal to have an income for her family.

A smiling giant of a woman (she is seen raising her hand on the picture), currently in her 11th loan cycle, she is a 36-year-old widow, the mother of seven children all attending school: four in the primary and three in the secondary school system.\r\n\r\nHer husband passed away 25 January 2005 in Kigali (Rwanda) following a prolonged lung-related illness. She has been the sole support of her children these past five years, which weighs heavily on the rapid expansion of her business.\r\n\r\nHer business is free-style in nature, itinerant without a fixed location. She provides bed sheets, children\u2019s clothing, pagnes and boubous (colourful West-African clothing), and gold jewelry to all who are interested. It has now been five years since she began an activity known as \u201clutte-lutte pita pita\u201d.\r\n\r\nShe used to live in Kigali, where most of her in-laws reside, and following her husband\u2019s death, without any savings, she began weaving clothes and tablecloths, etc. The earnings from this activity (craft) enabled her to move from Rwanda to the Democratic Republic of Congo with her children, where with her remaining $50 she was able to settle in a guesthouse.\r\n\r\nShe started to trade in tomatoes, gasoline, salt, milk, powdered detergent (OMO). Then she learned that the Hekima MFI provided loans without collateral, and she was granted her first reinforcement loan.\r\n\r\nShe had just re-established some financial balance when she became one of many victims of the 8 July 2009 fire that destroyed over 900 homes in Goma, inside the Birere shanty-town.\r\n\r\nWith the Hekima MFI loan Kapinga M. wishes to increase her turnover by buying 6 pairs of bedsheets, a half-dozen gold chains (locally called \u201cGarantie manzanza\u201d), a half-dozen quality dresses from Congo Brazzaville, and six pagnes.\r\n\r\nShe is also an Evangelist acolyte in a local church (Christ is King) and sometimes participates in \u201cSpiritual Combat\u201d, a Christian revivalist ministry.\r\n\r\nShe is comfortable with how her business is going, and in the future envisions buying a plot of land as inheritance for her children and eventually renting out as a property owner. Additionally she hopes to see all of her children finish their studies with diplomas that will serve them in their future.\r\n\r\nKapinga M. thanks the Hekima MFI for the loans she has received without any collateral because that is what enabled her to meet her children\u2019s needs. She was finally able to enjoy relief and financial stability for the first time since her husband\u2019s death, thanks to Hekima\u2019s loans.\r\n\r\nThe Hodari loan group is made up of 15 members, for the most part women.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Ren\u00e9 McConnell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":5000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":5000,"image":{"id":525421,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"6 pairs of bedsheets, 6 guaranteed gold chains, 6 quality dresses from Congo Brazzaville, and 6 pagnes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

He is a cheerful, hard working young man.  He cohabits with Sarita, 18, who is 8 months pregnant.  They live together in their own house where peace and concord reign.\r\n\r\nJhony is a very responsible young man who is very knowledgeable in his work: he\u2019s a farmer.  His parents taught his this occupation when he was quite young and since then he\u2019s worked his own field for the last four years.  He has three hectares producing the following crops: cocoa beans, coffee and bananas.  During harvest time he hires day laborers to help.  He is quite aware that this contribution he\u2019s getting is to produce good quality fruit.  He sells his cocoa beans and coffee in the city of San Francisco because that\u2019s where the best prices for these grains are available.\r\n\r\nWhat he enjoys the most about his work is harvesting because that\u2019s when the long months of hard work bear fruit in the good quality of his crops.  Transporting his products from the fields to the drying spaces is the most difficult part of the job.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has four children who are all married, and currently cares for two of her granddaughters who live with her.  \r\n\r\nShe tells us that since she was very young, she had to work and it was very difficult since she was a single mother and had to help her children get ahead.  More than 16 years ago, she started to sell cosmetics and perfumes to her friends and neighbors in her community.  First, she shows her catalogs to her customers and they place an order.

She has proven to have the heart of an entrepreneur and is enthusiastic about her small business. Her integrity and good reputation make her a pleasant person to work with. She has received and repaid a total of 19 loans with \u201cNadiya Ukraine\u201d without any delinquencies. \r\n \r\nSvitlana would like to get a loan of $1,000 to purchase additional products for her kiosk. She is planning to buy a variety of chocolate candy, and good quality teas and coffee from wholesalers who distribute these products to retail vendors. Svitlana recently lost her father and she incurred many expenses with the funeral. However, she is working hard to sustain her business and secure its expansion. This loan will enable Svitlana provide a wide range of food products for sale in her kiosk and will help guarantee consistent growth in her business which is key to her family\u2019s well-being.

completed seven previous loan cycles with Asociacion Arariwa. The twenty group members all live in the city of Cusco and dedicate themselves to a variety of different businesses.\r\n<p>\r\nFernando P. G. is 33 years old and single. He works independently as a systems engineer and works for the international NGO Worldvision, the SIS computing company, and the Hotel San Agustin. His three employers keep him pretty busy as he usually has jobs all through the week. He has been in this line of work for the past six or seven years. Fernando is requesting a loan of $150 to install ceramic tiles on the staircase of his house. He will hire someone to do the job, which will cost 1000 soles in total (US$300); he will pay for the rest of the job out of his salary. This is Fernando\u2019s first loan cycle with the Salud Village Bank.\r\n<p>\r\nFour of the group members work at a local nursery school run by PRONOEI, a government institution that provides daycare\/nursery schooling to children between the ages of 3 and 5 from low-income families. The women are paid very little (one of the women refers to her salary as \u201ca tip\u201d), so they all have side businesses to generate more income. They each earn 300 soles per month (US $95). Hermila V. V. and Maria Elena P. C. both sell stuffed animals at a Saturday market in the Santiago neighborhood of Cusco; each says that on a good day she earns as much as 250 soles in profits.  Filomena C. M. works at the same market selling second hand clothing. She travels to Puno once a week to buy the clothing, and says she earns as much as 300 soles on a good weekend. These three women will invest their Kiva loans in purchasing more merchandise for their respective businesses at the Baratillo market.\r\n<p>\r\nSonia P. H. is 47 years old and married. She has one son who is 15; she also lost a child to medical negligence. She runs a small business with her husband selling communications devices to municipal offices in small towns in the countryside around Cusco. These devices generate radio and television signals. She handles the administrative end of this while her husband is in charge of the technical part.\r\n<p>\r\nThe couple has been in this business for the past 18 years, so they are well known in the area and use word of mouth to advertise their services. Most of the equipment has to be special ordered from Lima or Arequipa, says Sonia, though some of the smaller parts can be found and assembled in Cusco. The couple works alone most of the time, though they occasionally hire someone to work on transmission towers. Sonia will use her loan of $700 to buy part of a larger piece of equipment. $700 is enough to buy the cables and connectors, she says; the entire piece of equipment will cost about $1500. Sonia\u2019s goal for the future is to expand her business from a micro-enterprise to a larger company.\r\n<p>\r\nThe group is requesting a total of $4,400. The members have all pledged to repay their Kiva loans in full and on time. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4400,"image":{"id":305671,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Install ceramic tiles, buy stuffed animals, used clothing, cables and connectors for satellite","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"CUSCO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.518333 -71.978056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2009-05-01T07:00:32Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4400,"lender_count":127,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nancy Nicanora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rocio Luisa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Naciazena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bilarmina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dignidad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agripino ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Catalina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Elena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Filomena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jenny ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kriss Gin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nayra","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Modesto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hermila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fernando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Hilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Agripinino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":4400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":1052.27},{"due_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.82},{"due_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":1116.31},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1147.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1052.27},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1083.82},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1116.31},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1147.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1052.27,"local_amount":1052.27,"processed_date":"2009-05-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T21:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1052.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44409845},{"amount":1083.82,"local_amount":1083.82,"processed_date":"2009-06-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T18:06:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1083.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52918292},{"amount":1116.31,"local_amount":1116.31,"processed_date":"2009-07-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T11:24:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1116.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63139131},{"amount":1147.6,"local_amount":1147.6,"processed_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T12:19:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1147.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73564751}],"funded_date":"2009-05-07T17:35:45Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T12:19:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Thelma Phillips","image":1504990}},{"id":106777,"name":"Goodnews","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Goodnews E. is twenty-seven years old and married with one child.

She lives in her own home, and her greatest dream is to live peacefully in her old age. Damiana's brick oven is located in the outskirts of the city of Juliaca, and she wakes up very early each morning to mix and mold the bricks, which she fires in the oven 10 days later. This activity has provided her with enough income to help her three children get ahead in life, and this is why she continues to make bricks. Her favorite part of the job is selling bricks and seeing that her work is well compensated.

Her desire to overcome enabled her to improve the living conditions for her family, which consists of her elderly mother and her 30 year old son who helps with the work around the house.\r\n<p>\r\nSelling clothes was one of the jobs she enjoyed as a young woman.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the future, Sophia plans to increase the quantity and range of her stock. She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":140707,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To expand her business by purchasing additional clothes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-18T23:50:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sophia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-03T15:09:13Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":1200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":120000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":120000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":102.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-05-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":200095},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-06-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:34:56Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227089},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-07-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:01Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":256329},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-08-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":285070},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-09-03T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-19T07:16:46Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315263},{"amount":103,"local_amount":120585.37,"processed_date":"2008-10-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":121591.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346836},{"amount":99.5,"local_amount":116487.78,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:21:17Z","rounded_local_amount":117459.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347578},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:06:18Z","rounded_local_amount":121001.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970198},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:10:11Z","rounded_local_amount":121001.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886448},{"amount":102.5,"local_amount":120000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:02Z","rounded_local_amount":121001.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435734}],"funded_date":"2008-03-20T15:09:13Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":45333,"name":"Juana","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<p>Juana belongs to the community Bank Mujeres Creatives 2, located at Jr. Maya de Britto and Alfonso Ugarte, in the district Calleria in the city of Ucayali.

from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania! This is 25-year-old Suzane M., who is married and has two children aged three and seven. In 2007, Suzane established her charcoal business. Working six days a week, eight hours a day, and assisted by her husband, she earns about $30 every month.  She now requests a loan in order to purchase additional stocks of charcoal. In the future, Suzane plans to increase both the quantity and range of the stock.  She thanks you for your support. <P>These small, black, and dirty pieces of dry earth are important not just to charcoal sellers but to their customers, who rely on charcoal to cook their meals. Many Tanzanians still use small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal), and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags or kerosene in order to light them. The fire requires constant fanning to ignite and maintain the flame, and makes cooking quite a hot and laborious task. It may not be the easiest or most environmentally friendly form of cooking, but it is the only option many people can afford."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":183563,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of charcoal in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-07-22T22:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Suzane","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-06T00:36:09Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-09-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:26:43Z","rounded_local_amount":32603.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":318233},{"amount":28,"local_amount":30545.45,"processed_date":"2008-10-06T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-18T07:20:06Z","rounded_local_amount":32603.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":350111},{"amount":26.5,"local_amount":28909.1,"processed_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:31:06Z","rounded_local_amount":30856.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347885},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:07:19Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970457},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:19Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886674},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435936},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:00Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130240},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:37Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027073},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:21Z","rounded_local_amount":32021,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613113},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:37Z","rounded_local_amount":32020.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010196}],"funded_date":"2008-07-23T00:36:09Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":61718,"name":"Alejandra","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Alejandra began her business after working at various jobs.

Alejandra wants her children to get ahead so that they can have a better future and better professional opportunities. She began in January of 2003, first selling ceramics. That didn't go well, so Alejandra finished off the merchandise. This year she began to sell clothing in the nearby markets and her business has taken off.

Sometimes travelling T. these remote villages can be a tedious part of the job of a Fellow, but Santa Clara is one of my favourite villages that I have visited, and I don't hesitate T. agree T. go.\r\n<P>\r\nAfter the long but easy journey there, I meet with the Ca\u00f1averales group on the patio next T. the kitchen of a senior member just off  one of the main streets of Santa Clara.  The bright floral-patterned blouses and skirts of the women nearly blind one with their brilliance and the space is abuzz with their happy conversation and laughter.  Children of all ages dart back and forth between the women, being so affectionate with each that it's difficult T. tell which woman is a particular child's mother.  Despite the commotion, it takes only a few moments before I can quiet everyone so I can ask them a few questions.\r\n\r\n<P>Despite the fact that Santa Clara is most famous for basket-making (as proudly displayed on the sign that welcomed me inT. the town), the common thread of the group is that all 17 women tend small farms, raising either chickens or pigs or both.  Fourteen of them also supplement their income with embroidery while three others put their sewing skills T. work.  One of the women also buys and sells clothing.  The group's president, Carmen Rosa, who has a farm of 50 chickens and embroiders as well, tells me that none of the women has T. leave the town T. sell their products as Santa Clara is the commercial hub for the surrounding area.\r\n<P>\r\nThese women are no strangers T. micro-credit.  They already know the life-changing potential of this money; for some of them, this will be their eighth loan.  Friendship Bridge is implementing a new repayment scheme for experienced groups such as this one.  The Ca\u00f1averales will pay back this loan in 9 months instead of the normal 13, and they're quite confident of their ability T. meet this more demanding schedule.\r\n<P>\r\nT. my question about the benefits this loan may bring, one of the older women, Catalina, tells me that she just recently had all her chickens and her pig slaughtered.  With the credit that she's applying for now, she hopes T. replenish her stocks and this time she'll try T. raise two pigs.  Another younger woman, Florinda, stands up and says  that with the profit she makes with her embroidery design, her ever-growing young children will finally be able T. have clothes that fit them for school.\r\n<P>\r\nMy last question of the session: what are your dreams?  The answer is never very different from group T. group, or even person T. person, anywhere across the world.  All the women want their children T. have a better life with more opportunities than they have had.  Resoundingly and almost in one voice, they hope that their children can achieve a level of education that was unavailable T. them.  The extra money from micro-credit loans like the ones provided by Kiva and Friendship Bridge will help ensure that this will happen."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4850,"image":{"id":204523,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"invest

She is 48 years old. Marivic is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Marivic owns and operates a business venture in the agricultural sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting a variety of vegetables for sale. Marivic has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Marivic joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Marivic has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase fertilizer, such as manure. Marivic is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Marivic from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Her husband Edgar, who is 42 years old, helps in his wife's business activities. They have four children who are between 5 mos. and 19 years old. Jocelyn joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past seven loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jocelyn has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to buy more stocks of Ready-to-Wear Clothes  so that she can continue to save up for future business expansion.

He lives in a large extended family in Kabo\u00efla II- Sikasso (the third administrative district of Mali). Not having had a chance to go on with his studies, ten years ago he launched a business buying and reselling fruits, vegetables and tubers: potatoes, oranges, lemons, sweet potatoes, melons, bananas, yams, mangoes etc. With his long experience, he enjoys a good business reputation in Bamako and receives many orders, but lacks the necessary resources to meet demand. And so he joined Soro Yiriwaso and is now on his first loan, which will allow him to increase his working capital in order to meet the customers\u2019 expectations. This first loan will allow him to buy  10 bags of oranges, 15 bags of lemons and 20 bags of sweet potatoes  from villages around Sikasso. He sells wholesale and retail, for cash and on credit, to customers coming from all social segments but mostly to restaurant owners. With this first loan, he plans to achieve a monthly income of 100,000 West African Francs, which will be used to cover the essential expenses for himself and his relatives and to pay off the interest on his loan, with the rest reinvested in his business."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":863421,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"to buy fruits, vegetables and tubers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-09-05T19:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mohamedi ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":112.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:13Z","rounded_local_amount":51338.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232882139},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:22:59Z","rounded_local_amount":51338.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699236},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-11-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:12:13Z","rounded_local_amount":51338.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244655507},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:22:38Z","rounded_local_amount":51338.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250874296},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:47:49Z","rounded_local_amount":51338.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257283122},{"amount":112.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:20Z","rounded_local_amount":51338.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263424630}],"funded_date":"2011-09-15T19:42:48Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T11:00:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":337118,"name":"Julieta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julieta is 56 years old and married with 7 children.\r\n\r\nJulieta works hard to provide for her family.

After buying the tractor, her work on the rice field was much less tiring. Her family also earned some profit from renting the tractor. Mrs. M. uses her profit from selling fruits in the market to repay. This time, she wants to borrow 575 USD to directly invest in selling fruits.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It is a beautiful area with honest and hard-working residents, one of the most dignified in Manabi.\r\n\r\nGeovanni lives in this area, and is dedicated to his work and family.  He works as a street vendor, selling different types of clothing depending on the season.  Now, for example, he is selling school uniforms since classes have started.  Likewise, with Mother\u2019s Day near, he will focus on buying robes, blouses, under garments, bed sheets, etc., products he knows will be in high demand for this celebration.  Geovanni always tries to invest in the products he knows will be in greatest demand.\r\n\r\nHe lived in the Esmeraldas area for 22 years, and relocated to Picoaza 3 years ago.  He buys merchandise whenever he has the opportunity, previously traveling to Guayaquil for his purchases.  Now, he goes to Santo Domingo where he comments business is currently better.  He buys on a weekly basis, investing $400 or $500 based on what he\u2019s collecting.  He has been working for 20 years, and is originally from Picoaza but relocated to Esmeraldas and returned to his native town at 22 years of age.

She is 34 years old, married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Maria Annie owns and operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, toothpaste, canned goods, junk foods, and detergents in the local community. Maria Annie has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Maria Annie joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Maria Annie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from HSPFI. That loan was used to to purchase additional products to buy and sell. Maria Annie is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional inventory and acquire working capital. This loan will be Maria Annie's third loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, we created this template for our field staff to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate

Republic).\r\nShe is married with three grown children.  She lives with her husband and is the guardian of two school-aged granddaughters.  Tamara was the eldest daughter of a simple farm family.  She spent most of her time doing household chores: looking after her younger sister, doing homework, and doing housework.  When Tamara graduated from school she started studying sales at the Przhevalsky Vocational College (in the Issykulsky region of the Kirghiz Republic). There she met her husband, and she married when she was eighteen.   In 1968, she had a son. That year they decided to move to Zhajylma village (in the Chujsky region of the Kirghiz Republic) where they got jobs as a milkmaid and as a tractor operator. The collective farm allocated them some land in the village to build a house.  In 1970 and 1972 Tamara gave birth to two more daughters.\r\nTamara's family did not immediately have a farm.  On the land allocated to them by the state, they built a house and started the farm with cattle they had bred. In time, the two oldest daughters married and left home.  Tamara had to sell part of their cattle to help support them.  Presently, Tamara and her husband receive pensions and also work on the collective farm as watchmen.\r\nNow on her farm, Tamara has two bulls and ten sheep.  Tamara plans to increase her cattle, and therefore is asking for a loan of 60,000 som (KGS).\r\nTamara dreams of further expanding the farm to create living conditions worthy of her family.  \r\n\r\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable population.

This way of working will allow her to generate resources to support her future family since she\u2019s currently single.\r\n\r\nWhen she is asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers that she likes the credit training and the health services.\r\n\r\nIn the photograph two of Justa\u2019s daughters appear; they are the two young girls in front.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1250,"image":{"id":813271,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy a sewing machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2011-07-17T19:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1250,"lender_count":47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irene Sofia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Justa Feliza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Asunta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lizeth\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":8585.85,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":858.62},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":858.62},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":858.62},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":858.62},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":858.62},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":858.62},{"due_date":"2011-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":858.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":858.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":858.62},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":858.27}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.01},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.01},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.01},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.01},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.01},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":124.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":125.01,"local_amount":858.62,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:27:25Z","rounded_local_amount":870.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221746238},{"amount":250.01,"local_amount":1717.24,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:17:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1740.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227115865},{"amount":250.01,"local_amount":1717.24,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1740.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232877520},{"amount":250.01,"local_amount":1717.24,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:20:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1740.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238694227},{"amount":250.01,"local_amount":1717.24,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:08:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1740.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244650261},{"amount":124.95,"local_amount":858.27,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:15:16Z","rounded_local_amount":869.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250867258}],"funded_date":"2011-07-18T05:05:01Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T11:15:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":320730,"name":"Mama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"This is 50-year-old Mama.

Velasco is 55 and has lived through some pretty rough times. During the violent years of the 1980\u2019s civil war in Guatemala her house was burned to the ground and her father-in-law was tortured and killed. It still near enough that it brings tears to her eyes when she discusses the subject. But right now she\u2019s making do with her several businesses: she raises chickens and pigs, weaves the traditional Mayan top called a huipil, and even has a little tiny store that carries sugar, soap, and other such daily necessities.  She\u2019ll use this loan to increase her animal production, adding 15 chickens and 3 pigs. The chickens will be half for laying eggs and half for later sale for meat.  Nicolasa can make about US$4.00\/week of profit on her eggs, a significant boost.<p>Nicolasa and her husband have 9 children, most grown, but with two daughters (13 and 16) still at home. Their 16-year-old is deaf, a significant challenge in a culture with no deaf-specific education. Most of the kids have received at least an elementary education. Nicolasa never did get much education, despite her dad\u2019s best efforts. He would take her to school, but she would hide and not go in. She did get just enough to be able to read and sign her name.<p>Nicolasa\u2019s husband commutes every day to Guatemala City, where he works in a flower company. The two of them do have some health problems at this time of their life; she has gastritis and he has high blood pressure. But they\u2019re doing pretty well, and she can walk all the way up a a pretty remote road to her home far above the highway.

She obtained her first loan to sell earrings, and so now she is no longer entirely dependent on her husband. Moreover, she is able to contribute to the household expenses. Married and the mother of one (1) child, she has another child of her husband's in her care.

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, filled with epic mountain passes,  is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, and to a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Aufaatasi has been engaged in this business for more than two years and earns approximately 500 WST a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Aufaatasi  joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Aufaatasi  has successfully repaid a previous loan of 1250 WST from SPBD. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Aufaatasi  is now requesting a new loan of 1500 WST, which will also be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the third loan taken out by Aufaatasi from SPBD. Aufaatasi plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\n\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":364710,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

Suy S. is a local chef. She is also hired by people who need her to cook food for their parties. She is 59 and a widowed mother who has given birth to two daughters. One of the daughters is married and one is single. Suy S. also depends on other income from her both daughters who are garment workers for industry at Phnom Penh.
