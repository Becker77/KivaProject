Lourdes C., a CCT* community partner, sees its value in her life. At 57, she has some college learning to look back to, but what helps her a lot with her business now is her involvement in the entrepreneurial trainings and Bible studies in CCT. \r\n\r\nLourdes is married to Bonifacio, and together they have three children. Their family resides in Dasmarinas, Cavite.\r\n\r\nLourdes is part of the food industry on the local level. She sells smoked fish and dried fish along with cold cuts and frozen food. Because her sales depend on the demand of her regular customers in the community, her income varies every month, but it averages roughly PHP 11,300.\r\n\r\nWith no employees to help her, Lourdes has been working perseveringly for ten years now.\r\n\r\nA loan worth PHP 20,000 is deemed necessary for Lourdes to help her grow her business. She then applies for such, intending to use the money to purchase more quantities of in-demand food such as frozen food and smoked fish. She wants to do this so that she will not run out of stocks in case her customers order more than what they usually buy.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for Lourdes to face the months of vacation, because then her sales drop low. But she strives to come up with strategies to make her business continue gaining profits even during vacation.

Con \u00e9ste trabajo le esta yendo bien, ya que como su mototaxi es propia no tiene que pagar a alguien por el alquiler de una, y eso le genera mas ganancias.

Este ser\u00e1 el cr\u00e9dito n\u00famero doce con MFP, y est\u00e1 contento con el grupo al que pertenece ya que son muy responsables y siempre cumplen a tiempo.

He lives with his partner and he has two children aged 10 and 4 who depend on him for their education. They live together in their own house where he and his partner share the joy of raising their children, who are his motivation for getting ahead. \r\n\r\nHis job consists of providing transport and he owns the mototaxi which he sets out on very early in the morning, in search of passengers. He subsequently travels around the different streets of his city, something which he has done for 10 years and thanks to this, he has managed to provide comfort for his family. He also states that in this type of work he can decide what areas to prioritize, for example at 1pm he goes to the schools since the students get out at this time and at 6pm he goes to workplaces or town centers. This job is going well for him as due to the fact that his mototaxi is his own, he doesn't have to pay anyone for rental and this generates more profits. \r\n\r\nHis plan for the future is to buy two more vehicles in order to expand and rent them out. This will be the twelfth loan with MFP and he is happy with the group to which he belongs as they are always on time and very responsible. With the requested sum, he will buy some parts and send his mototaxi to the garage for some repair work. He will also invest in a small shop that he would like to open in his house.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":881310,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to buy parts for his mototaxi and take it to the repair shop as well as buying goods for his shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-28T19:20:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":232.45},{"due_date":"2011-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":227.04},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":247.56},{"due_date":"2012-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":256.79},{"due_date":"2012-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":261.27},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":274.89}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.23},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.77},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":94.16},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.8},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":85.23,"local_amount":232.45,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:56:22Z","rounded_local_amount":236.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666604},{"amount":83.25,"local_amount":227.04,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:19Z","rounded_local_amount":230.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621753},{"amount":90.77,"local_amount":247.56,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:40Z","rounded_local_amount":251.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250835834},{"amount":94.16,"local_amount":256.79,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:18:19Z","rounded_local_amount":260.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245592},{"amount":95.8,"local_amount":261.27,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:21Z","rounded_local_amount":265.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385645},{"amount":100.79,"local_amount":274.89,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:00Z","rounded_local_amount":279.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098701}],"funded_date":"2011-10-11T23:34:25Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam O'Brien","image":934632}},{"id":344967,"name":"Rin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rin, 42-years-old, is an animal seller.

They will use this loan to purchase three cows, a boat and a fishing net.   \r\n<p>\r\nCurrently, they grow food such as rice and raise chickens and a few pigs.  La also does construction work when he can find employment.  As is typical here in Cambodia, we met beneath their stilt house in the area that serves as an indoor\/outdoor live\/work space.  La explained that he actually built his family\u2019s home in 1994 using salvaged lumber.  The many tunnels and voids gnawed by termites testified to both the decrepitude of the prior dwelling that was the source of the lumber and the imminent need for replacement of this one.  When they save enough money, Pov and La said they hope to replace their very modest house with a new one.  \r\n<p>\r\nLa learned to raise cows many years ago before the Pol Pot regime here in Cambodia.  Because it is relatively expensive, beef has fallen down the list of sources of protein.  Nonetheless, as the economy joins in the growth of the other countries in this region, beef is regaining popularity.  Pov and Las's use mosquito netting to protect the animals from murderous bites and have already walled off a space beneath their house to use as a stall.  \r\n<p>\r\nPov and La explained that there is a breeder near their village who sells a bovine \u201cstarter pack\u201d of sorts \u2013 one adult male and one adult female for US $400 each plus one calf free of charge.  La and Pov say that it takes one year to raise a cow to maturity.  In that time, it will eat approximately $200 worth of food \u2013 mostly grass and rice straw.  These both need to be purchased due to high population density and to flooding during monsoon season (both factors limiting grazing space).  When the cow is mature, they sell it either for slaughter or for further husbandry.  \r\n<p>\r\nBy far the most popular source of protein here is fish.  This country is graced with an abundance of freshwater lakes from which Cambodians harvest two-thirds of the protein they consume.  La has fished for many years but has never owned his own boat.  A used boat and a net will cost them about $200."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":85281,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing

The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":192624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more clothes in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:30:48Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ema E.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T18:57:18Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":90}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:56Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356216},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:51Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347969},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:20Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970543},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:30Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886760},{"amount":90,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":104220,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436020}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T18:57:18Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65481,"name":"Ngo Thi","description":{"languages":["vi"],"texts":{"vi":"Mrs. Ngo Thi T. is 45 years old.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She is single and lives independently. Mary lives in a rented apartment in a commercial town called Bekwai, close to Obuasi (a gold mining town) in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Most of the inhabitants of Bekwai work in commercial activities. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>She trades in fresh yam and garments of clothing to make an income to support herself.

She is married and is raising three children. They live together in the community of  Sirenachayocc, located in the beautiful jungle of Cuzco, where they have their own house made of adobe.  For Julia, the lessons and learning her family left her have been very important, and for this she owes them a lot. Today she has a grocery store, selling from her house. Most of her neighbors go to her establishment. Nonetheless her family went throuh some crises, when at first selling food that she offered before didn't work out.  With time and with the support of her husband, they took the risk of setting up the store and it wasn't a mistake- now they make good earnings.  In the future, they want to get into agriculture, growing coffee and cacao, in order to have extra income and set aside something for any problem that comes their way.  She generally does the work herself, but on ocassions receives help from her children.  Her plans for the future are to expand her business to other strategically located locales in order to attract new customers. This is her fourth loan with MFP and she is committed to making the payments on time. She also feels happy with her community group. With the loan she is asking for, she will invest in purchasing a greater quantity of merchandise to supply her store, in order to increase her sales. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":549818,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more merchandise to supply her store.

She is the leader of an eight-member group loan offered by Kiva partner, ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Jovita A.'s Group.\r\n<br>Jovita is 51 years old, married and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, Jovita owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store selling a variety of different products in the local community. Jovita has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP per month from these activities.\r\n<br>In 2006, Jovita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from ASKI. This loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Jovita is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her eleventh from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About ASKI<\/b><br>\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":725021,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

So her mother will take charge of her business operation from then on. \r\n\r\nHer business is quite profitable because of the good location, and customers are happy with the polite and honest service that she provides. She opens her store from March to November and shuts it down during winter times when the profit is much less compared with other seasons.\r\n\r\nEnhzaya is a diligent and open-minded woman who says, \"One can do anything if one lives healthy.\" She is requesting a 500,000 MNT loan to purchase more products in order to increase the varieties of her goods for sale.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Delia has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Delia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Delia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to additional capital for her farm. Delia is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP which will be used to finance land preparation and to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the eighth loan taken out by Delia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

S. is a 63 year old lady, and she joined SPBD in April 2006, with he first loan of $300.00. Fuatai is now on her 4th loan and she never had problems with her repayment. She\u2019s a very creative and talented lady. That enjoys trying out new ideas of creating stuffs. Before joining SPBD, she already had her variety shop, where she spends all her time looking after. Apart from every other product that you can find in any other shop, you can be amazed with other interesting products that Fuatai makes that she also sells in her shop i.e. Samoan Oil that is made from the Moso\u2019oi flower, which is quite famous with Samoans. She also makes S. Cocoa, that is used to make tea. With the Europeans, coffe is what they have for morning tea, but with the Samoan, their coffee is Samoan Cocoa, which we believe gives ua strength for the whole day.Well, you may think that it\u2019s cheap because it\u2019s a local product, but it\u2019s not, for a bottle of Nescafe maybe costs you about $10.00, but for one pack of Samoan Cocoa costs $7.00, and believe it or not, this can only last for half a day. Fuatai also sells clothes that she sew, but mainly school uniform for the kids. Other stuffs she sells, are coconuts, bananas, taro, guavas that she collects from her husbands plantation, and fresh flowers that she picks from her garden. She also do bouquet of flowers for church decorations, weddings etc. With her forth loan now, she\u2019s planning on extending her business selling live chickens and pigs."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":12717,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Restock her shop and home improvement","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"WS","country":"Samoa","town":"Papauta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.583333 -172.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":15,"posted_date":"2007-01-24T02:01:44Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fuatai","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-02-07T15:05:43Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":750,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":126,"local_amount":126,"processed_date":"2007-03-26T10:31:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-27T10:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":126,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":11771},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2007-05-02T23:47:10Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-27T10:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14686},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2007-06-05T22:27:13Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-27T10:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20533},{"amount":126,"local_amount":126,"processed_date":"2007-07-26T09:15:43Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-27T10:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":126,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35450},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2007-08-26T09:16:06Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-27T10:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":46397},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2007-09-26T09:15:57Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-27T10:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":58688},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2007-10-26T09:15:57Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-27T10:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":72002},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T10:15:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-27T10:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86741},{"amount":63,"local_amount":63,"processed_date":"2007-12-26T09:16:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-27T10:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":102727},{"amount":57,"local_amount":57,"processed_date":"2008-01-26T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-27T10:12:46Z","rounded_local_amount":57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":121783}],"funded_date":"2007-01-24T15:05:43Z","paid_date":"2008-01-26T10:15:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":8141,"name":"Alim","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alim P. owns a cellular phone and cellular phone accessories store in the small town of Khachmaz, located on the Northeastern coast of Azerbaijan.

She then decided to look for a financial institution willing to help.\r\nShe first borrowed money from the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Gueguegue (Gueguegue Association) located in Boane, which offered credit to group applicants. It turned out not to be a good experience because the amount granted was smaller than the amount requested and she had to be responsible for the payments in case one of the other partners defaulted. \r\nShe became aware of Hluvuku-Adsema existence through a friend and because she wanted to expand her business, she requested her first loan.

Her children help around also anytime they are unable to be present. The profit generated is used to cover household expenses such as school costs and health care for her children. \r\nHer business has a positive impact in the community because it provides employment to herself and her husband and also it brings needed products closer to customers.\r\nIn the future she intends to open up a new location under her name.\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by

It is also known for its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

SPBD's loans are May's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for May G. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.66 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.21 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.

She is 45 years-old. Norma is the group leader of a two member group loan offered by Kiva partner PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nNorma is married and has five school-aged children. Norma owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Norma has been engaged in her business for over 20 years and earns approximately 10,000.00 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Norma joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Norma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000.00 PHP from PMPC. Norma is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Norma from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

Bertha has already received and successfully repaid two loans from SELFINA, and now requires a new loan in order to buy more crops in bulk. She thanks you for your support.  \r\n\r\n\r\nSELFINA is engaged in economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facilities as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed uncreditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\r\n\r\nSELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from the client, extending a loan to then, then leasing back the same equipment \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":182699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy more crops in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-07-21T18:50:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bertha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-05T19:08:47Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-09-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-20T07:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":81270,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":317202},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-10-05T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-17T07:21:54Z","rounded_local_amount":81270,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":348953},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:29:34Z","rounded_local_amount":81270,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347854},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:07:33Z","rounded_local_amount":81270,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970426},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:20Z","rounded_local_amount":81270,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886643},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":81270,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435911},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:54:02Z","rounded_local_amount":81270,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130216},{"amount":69.99,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:39Z","rounded_local_amount":81270,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027049},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:23Z","rounded_local_amount":81270,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613089},{"amount":70.01,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:29Z","rounded_local_amount":81270,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010172}],"funded_date":"2008-07-22T19:08:47Z","paid_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":61410,"name":"Ndeshifose's Mercy Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ndeshifose is married with 2 children aged 19 and 15 years old.

None of the group members are related to each other. All of the members of the \u201cLa Exaltaci\u00f3n\u201d Microfinance Institute partake in different business activities, such as selling clothing, cosmetics, or food. Others are in carpentry, metal arc welding, or make pants. As in all businesses, competition always exists, especially when selling goods. That is where the quality of the product is top priority, along with the entrepreneur\u2019s experience in lowering prices and making deals with the customer. This loan will be used to purchase merchandise and supplies needed to improve the quality of their products, thus boosting profits and providing the group members\u2019 families with a better quality of life. Within the group we can find people who are working in a solidarity group for the first time, but the other members who already have experience in this field promise that the loan obligation will be met because they trust the rest of the members. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva

He has been a farmer for 10 years, an activity he undertook after having his first child. However, Abdukahhor has always taken pleasure in working the land and now particularly enjoys cultivating tomatoes and millet. Although his crops are annual, they are very profitable, and during the season they are very much in demand in large quantities. For this reason, Abdukahhor diligently cares for his crops so he can benefit from a good harvest. He also mentions that it is difficult sowing the plants and protecting them from insect infestation. This is his first loan application with IMON International. Abdukahhor will invest the funds he requests to purchase seeds and fertilizer for his farmland.  \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes:  its role as a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She has lived in the city for the past eight years. She took out a clean-fuel loan to help her save money and to reduce air pollution in the city. Davaa said that the fuel \u201chas many advantages, including the need to use less of it than regular fuel and that keeps us warmer. It is an especially nice opportunity for people who have a low income to purchase the fuel through a loan. By using this cleaner fuel, we use less fuel. For example, we previously had to burn extra fuel at night, but now we don\u2019t need to do that because the new fuel burns longer.\u201d \r\n\r\nAbout XacBank Eco Products Program\r\n\r\nUlaanbaatar is the coldest capital in the world. Winter temperatures can average -20 Celsius. Sixty percent of the city's population live in tents called gers, with wooden frames covered by layers of wool felt.

For more than six years she has been growing potatoes, corn, as well as vegetables such as onions and lettuce on her own land.  Each morning, she and her husband go to the fields to care for their crops and protect them from pests and occasional weather changes that can hurt production.  In addition, Maritza raises guinea pigs and chickens on her farm and sells them each week to earn extra income.  She enjoys her work tremendously because it allows her to be in the country and appreciate the beautiful landscape that surrounds her community.  In addition, she is rewarded when her crops are sold.

Anorbegim hopes to continue to develop her business by opening several more pharmaceutical kiosks.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They live together in their own house located in the community of Palmapampa in the district of Samugari. Ra\u00fal is a young man with many hopes and goals. It is for this reason that when he got engaged to Hortensia, Ra\u00fal's parents gave him 2 hectares of land.

He mentioned that harvest time is when he is happiest since he produces in quantity and this gives him greater profitability when it is sold to the businesses. The thing he considers most difficult is transferring the products from where they are harvested to where they are dried. Now his biggest priority is to put together more capital to buy new land and plant new plants. This is his first loan with MFP and he feels that this investment will help him greatly progressing his work. He is grateful to the communal bank for having confidence in him and allowing him to work together with the rest of the members.

He is 43 years old. Leonilo is married and has 5 school-aged children. To make a living, Leonilo owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting rice for sale. Leonilo has been engaged in his business for over 21 years and earns approximately 12745 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Leonilo joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonilo has successfully repaid a previous loan of 40000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used  to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Leonilo is requesting a new loan of 40000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. It will also help him to finance for farm maintenance. This loan will be the seventh loan taken out by Leonilo from GDMPC. He plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She also cares for many relatives that live with her. For the last five years, she has been operating a food stall from her home in Empangeni, South Africa. She sells cakes, chips, and sausages to her neighbors. She also receives money from the South African government to support her children.\r\n\r\nBonhiwe requested a loan through WDB and Kiva to buy ingredients that she will use to make food.

Nessy expects to earn about 200 USD from increased sales after getting this loan. In the future she hopes to increase the quantity and range of the business.\r\n<P>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of microcredit in Tanzania. The organization is devoted to the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through microfinance as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; because of this, they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services. When a client needs working capital to buy a specific item, SELFINA buys the equipment for said client and extends a loan to her. The same equipment is then leased back to the client so they can use it while in process of paying back their loan, a process called a sale-and-leaseback arrangement. Once the loan has been repaid, SELFINA transfers the ownership of the equipment to the client. The advantage of microleasing over traditional microfinance loans is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":192690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of traditional African cloth in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-08-30T18:20:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nessy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-09-13T19:17:20Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-10-11T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-21T07:17:57Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":356219},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:18:52Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347972},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:09:26Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970546},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886763},{"amount":55,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":63690,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436023}],"funded_date":"2008-08-30T19:17:20Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":65529,"name":"Zuhuru","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zuhuru M., age 45, is married with 4 children.

Since a big part of her working capital is represented in the cover charges, she is looking for financing so that she can respond to each new customer that her most profitable customers refer to her. And also to earn a discount on promotions for large volume and cash purchases. In this way, she will improve her usefulness, keeping in mind that currently her profitability is 15.5%, and buying with cash will save her money to attain opportunities on better offers, more customers, and better usefulness. This is her first loan with \"la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo\", and with this Kiva loan she will buy seasonal footwear for the end of the year. She knows the great commercial movement of this product very well, which will increase her sales. These days, she gets more referred customers that don't have cash to make a purchase, because of the family costs of the end of the year.

Muzafar has been baking traditional bread since a young age. He inherited this skill from his father and grandfather. His working day starts at 4 a.m. when he and his assistants begin to knead dough, form the bread, and heat the stove. At the beginning, Muzafar kneads dough from two sacks of flour of 50 kg. each. The winter is an important period for his business, as there are many holidays this season. He needs to have a stock of flours and coal. For this reason Muzafar applied to IMON International for a loan of 8,200 Somoni.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nMore about IMON International\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Her husband is Rodrigo, her business partner, and a father to her children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses. \r\n\r\nEditha operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, five peso's worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns money by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) in sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a 15,000 PHP loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEditha hopes to be able to expand soon and dreams of being able to give her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work on her business.

This is 35-year-old Selina A D., who is divorced with two children aged 8 and 14. Selina has been running  a beauty salon business since 2003, a place where her friends and fellow women can gather and literally let their hair down.  Most beauty salons in Tanzania are places where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own.  It is quite a thing to be seen!\r\n\r\nSelina works at her business ten hours a day, seven days a week, earning a monthly profit of approximately $200.  She is now requesting a loan of $775 in order to purchase an additional hair dryer, chairs, hair products such as wigs, and other cosmetics.  Due to the success of this business, she hopes to open another in the future, and she thanks you in advance for your support.\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":248902,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

The main source of income for the business comes from selling specialty food products such as viands in the local community.  Imelda has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2008, Imelda joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Imelda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI to purchase raw ingredients needed to make viands for sale. \r\n<p>\r\nImelda is requesting a new loan of 14000 PHP to repair her food stall used in the business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.  But Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's history:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Catherine a d\u00e9j\u00e0 obtenu aupr\u00e8s de ALID\u00e9, un cr\u00e9dit qu\u2019elle a bien rembours\u00e9. Actuellement, Catherine ne dispose pas assez de fonds pouvant lui permettre de satisfaire le grand nombre de clients et de se faire plus de revenus \u00e0 la hauteur de ses diff\u00e9rentes charges. C\u2019est donc pour renforcer son activit\u00e9 que Catherine sollicite un deuxi\u00e8me cr\u00e9dit.","en":"Born on March 24, 1977 in Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin, Ms. B.

She is married to Mr. SINDEHOU Pinus and is the mother of three children, who are all in school.  The family lives together in PK 10.  She joins her husband in ensuring that family expenses are covered.\r\n\r\nCatherine attended primary school only.  For ten years, she has had a business selling porridge (made from corn and sugar) served with <i>p\u00e2t\u00e9s<\/i> (made from wheat flour and oil).

She lives in Dushanbe and owns a small vending store in the local market. For about two years Sharofat has been selling the national coat \u201cChapan\u201d for men and national dresses for women. Her store is well-known in the market for having a nice variety of assorted merchandise at affordable prices, and her profits have increased considerably since she started her business. Sharofat has a unique ability to analyze a merchandise market and find her niche, a skill that helped her start her business and make it successful. Today, in order to increase inventory and sales, she is requesting a loan of 5000 Somoni. With your help this will be possible. <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes:  its role as a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <p>\r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Chu Th\u1ecb is a 33-year-old female living in the town of huy\u1ec7n Y\u00ean Phong - t\u1ec9nh B\u1eafc Ninh.  She is married and has two school-aged children.  To making a living, H. owns and operates a specialized retail store.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling flowers in the local community.  H. has been engaged in this business for over 12 years and earns approximately 4.500.000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2007, H. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  H. has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7.392.000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase new equipment and tools to expand the business.  H. is now requesting a new loan of 9.632.000 VND that will be used to purchase additional products to sell.  The loan will be the 5th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  H. plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in Vietnamese while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n\r\n\r\nH.

Tabugon, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating one business venture, a general store business. Her husband Gregorio D., who is 55 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living. They have six children who are between 15 and 33 years old. \r\n\r\nVicenta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Vicenta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 14,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 20th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for future for student allowance and for family needs. \r\n\r\nVicenta D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is a single mother of 3 children who all go to school. Maria started higher level studies but left without completing them due to other time pressures. She lives in her own home with her family and she does not support anyone else.\r\nShe left her home town and came to Maputo in search of work. She has been a teacher for 16 years at the salt works' full primary school; she earns a monthly salary of 13,133.29MTs which covers her household expenses and leaves a little for her to save in her Millennium BIM bank account. \r\nShe has previously borrowed 30,000MTs from the Millennium BIM bank to start her project. She repaid this with ease. She heard about Hluvuku through a friend who is also a Hluvuku client. This is her third loan with this institution, for 20,000MTs, which Maria will use to buy building materials for her house (sand, beams, cement, iron, stone and other materials) in order to carry on with the work. Her previous loans were for 8,300MTs, 10,000MTs and 15,000MTs.\r\nMaria wants to finish building her house and furnish it so that her family will be comfortable. She intends to apply for further Hluvuku loans for this purpose. \r\n
