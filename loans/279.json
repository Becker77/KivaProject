The amount was not enough for any further improvements.

With the extra profit she had in her purse, she thought of saving it.\r\n\r\nAfter the second loan, Leutu was entitled to a 2,250 tala (US$ 900) loan, and thought of another business. She tried the pancakes but it didn\u2019t work, so she saved the rest of the loan. She said that one day while she was in the shop, a car stopped by her shop and asked if there\u2019s any nearby Laundromat in the area. That is when she got the idea of extending the building for the Laundromat. So she hurriedly paid up her loan, and ready for the next loan.\r\n\r\nOn Leutu\u2019s 3rd loan that she saved, plus this 4th loan, she was able to buy 2 washing machines. With the profit from the shop plus her savings, she was able to buy two Dryers. \u201cTwo washing machines and two dryers are good enough to start up with,\u201d  she

This will give her an opportunity to earn additional income and contribute to development of farming sector in her region. If calfs will be well fed, then the buyer will be able to purchase quality product. To achieve all that, she needs to obtain a credit.

Una de las actividades que realiza con m\u00e1s frecuencia es la venta de tamales, los cuales son consumidos a la hora del desayuno, pues son unos deliciosos aperitivos a base de ma\u00edz con relleno de carne muy solicitados por las madres de familia. Do\u00f1a Juana hace 12 a\u00f1os se dedica a la preparaci\u00f3n de estos productos, pues tiene el don de la cocina y sus  tamales son lo mejor que sabe preparar, es por ello que son muy solicitados en los mercados y las ferias. Adem\u00e1s cuando ha habido oportunidad, los ha preparado para grandes eventos o ferias de gastronom\u00eda. Juana desea seguir preparando estos deliciosos tamales, pero su mayor limitaci\u00f3n es que no tiene una movilidad para trasladar sus productos a los diversos lugares donde tiene que entregar sus pedidos, es por ello que su m\u00e1ximo sue\u00f1o es adquirir un auto para movilizarse, minimizando de esta manera sus gastos de producci\u00f3n. Este es su d\u00e9cimo pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, y desea seguir perteneciendo a este grupo de trabajo, pues junto a sus amigas aprendieron administrar su dinero, ya que tienen autonom\u00eda para organizarse y desarrollar habilidades dentro de su banco comunal. Juana  tiene pensado invertir 3500, por lo pronto, en la compra de un molino para agilizar la preparaci\u00f3n de sus tamales, pues el que tiene es muy antiguo y necesita algunos repuestos.","en":"Juana is very tenacious with the things she does, as she supports three small children and is also responsible for their education, and can no longer count on the support of her partner, with whom she separated many years ago. One of the activities Juana does frequently is to sell tamales, which are eaten at lunch time. They are delicious snacks made with corn and filled with meat and are very sought-after by other mothers. <p>\r\n<p>\r\nJuana has been preparing these products for 12 years. She has a gift for cooking, and her tamales are the best she knows to make. It is because of this that they are so sought-after in the markets and fairs. She also has made them for large events and food festivals. <p>\r\n<p>\r\nJuana would like to continue to prepare these delicious tamales, but her biggest limitation is that she is unable to transport her products to fill her orders. Due to this, her greatest dream is to acquire a vehicle to move her products, minimizing the costs of production. <p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is her tenth loan with MFP (a Kiva Partner), and she wishes to continue her membership with this group, as together with her friends, she was able to learn to administer her money, and she had the autonomy to organize and develop her skills with her community bank. Juana hopes to invest 3500 as soon as possible, to buy a new mill to speed the production of her tamales, as the one she has is very old and needs repair. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michelle Harrison, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":286887,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy a new mill for corn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-17T01:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":384.4},{"due_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":386.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":408.4},{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":423.23},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":445.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-27T07:00:00Z","amount":463.66},{"due_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":483.73},{"due_date":"2009-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":504.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":120.81},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":121.39},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.35},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.02},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":140.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":145.72},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.03},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":158.56}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":120.81,"local_amount":384.4,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:42:23Z","rounded_local_amount":388.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117233},{"amount":121.39,"local_amount":386.25,"processed_date":"2009-04-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":390.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012148},{"amount":128.35,"local_amount":408.4,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:57:58Z","rounded_local_amount":412.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595733},{"amount":133.02,"local_amount":423.23,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:44:39Z","rounded_local_amount":427.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989996},{"amount":140.12,"local_amount":445.83,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:47Z","rounded_local_amount":450.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211129},{"amount":201.06,"local_amount":639.75,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:38Z","rounded_local_amount":646.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640636},{"amount":255.25,"local_amount":812.14,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:42:12Z","rounded_local_amount":820.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080158}],"funded_date":"2009-03-17T04:24:50Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:42:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Harrison","image":180524}},{"id":98729,"name":"Fanny","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Fanny es una mujer soltera, que a sus 25 a\u00f1os lucha por mejorar su futuro, vive en un cuarto que alquil\u00f3 cuando llego a Puno desde su natal Desaguadero (Distrito de Puno) y espera forjarse una buena vida.

Este es el cuarto pr\u00e9stamo al que accede Esteban con MFP, siempre ha sido puntual en sus pagos, ya que no quiere crearle problemas a su banco comunal, en el cual participa activamente y es un socio muy querido. Con los mil doscientos nuevos soles solicitados comprar\u00e1 nuevas llantas para su motocarro, ya que las actuales ya est\u00e1n muy gastadas.","en":"Esteban is 34 years old and a loving family man. He lives with he wife Silvia, 24, and his two small children Rosemary, 5, and Juan, just 9 months old. What he wants most is to give them a good life. His activity is passenger transportation, which is why Esteban spends his days looking for customers who want to take his motorcycle taxi. He gets up very early to do his job and stays working until late at night so that he can bring home money. He is aware that his family needs him and he is responsible for them.\r\nWhat he likes best about his work is talking to his passengers and helping them pass the time. He has been doing this for 9 years and thinks that the most difficult part of his work is having to leave his family all day, but he knows he has to do it to provide for them. In the future he hopes to buy a new motorcycle taxi to work with so he can have more income. This is Esteban\u00b4s fourth loan with MFP. He has always been on time with he payments since he does not want to cause problems for his communal bank. He actively participates in his bank and is a very well-liked member. With the money requested he will buy new tires for his taxi, since the ones it has are quite worn.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Molly Puglisi, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":375184,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Buy tires for his motorcycle taxi.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-23T00:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esteban","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.83},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.84},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":70.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:12Z","rounded_local_amount":208.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081224},{"amount":70.84,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:00:48Z","rounded_local_amount":208.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997375},{"amount":70.83,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:21Z","rounded_local_amount":208.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842719},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:30Z","rounded_local_amount":626.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734301}],"funded_date":"2009-08-23T01:22:26Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T21:07:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Molly Puglisi","image":null}},{"id":135636,"name":"Nguy\u1ec5n's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"X.

He is a farmer from the small town of Vodyanoye. There are basically no jobs to be found in this town which is why Alexander decided to try his luck in farming 10 years ago. He has constructed 5 big arch greenhouses to grow early spring vegetables and sell them wholesale. Alexander has already invested 70,000 Grivnyas in his business. Every year he spends about 10,000 \u2013 12,000 Grivnyas on seeds and polyethylene film to protect greenhouses. \r\n\r\nAlexander has recently purchased two farmland lots. He is seeking a loan of 10,000 Grivnyas to build one or possibly two greenhouses on his new property.

She lives with 48 year-old Adan and they have five children together.  They live with two of their children, 20 year-old Jos\u00e9 and 12 year-old Jeancarlos, in their own home, in the village of Palcamayo.\r\n\r\nArmanda goes out every day to grow peas and spinach on the three plots of farmland that she owns.  She cares for the plants, irrigates them and fertilizes them for approximately three months.  She then sells them in the central market in her village.  She says that there are seasons in which demand is higher and during those seasons she travels to the capital to sell her products at a higher price.\r\n\r\nArmanda was taught to work the land from an early age.  She knows when the growing seasons are, when to sell her produce and at what price.  During all these years, it has always upset her to see her crops fail owing to the constant frost that affects the south of the country.  However, she does not get discouraged.  On the contrary, she would like to continue working so that she can make progress, using modern technology to develop her pea and spinach crops.  She also learned how to fight pest infestations and produce better-quality products.\r\n\r\nFor now, Armanda has more incentive for her work as her young son is about to start a new level in his studies.  She plans to save more so that she can provide him with a good university education.\r\n\r\nArmanda is a member of the \"Patr\u00f3n San Crist\u00f3bal\" community bank and this is her tenth loan from MFP.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

She rents from a relative with her husband and 4 children, Milagros (17), Luis (14), Kevin (10) and Antonela (16 months). She hopes to give them a good life. For Ursula, renting out dresses is more an enjoyable pastime than a job; since she was young she always enjoyed trying out and matching her sisters' clothing. She has a stand in a shopping gallery in the center of the city of Puno, in which she kindly and happily serves her customers. She has spent four years in this business and enjoys it very much, since she likes advising her customers which dress looks best on them. She hopes to own a large store in the future in which she would not only rent dresses but also sell children's clothing. The hardest part of her work is caring for the dresses, as they must always be pretty and new so that they are easy to rent. This is her second loan with MFP; she has always been timely with her payments and will be so now. She is well-loved at her local bank by the other members since she is very active and supportive. She will use the 1500 new soles for more dresses in order to improve her stand and provide more variety to her customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shanti Singh, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":296276,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase new dresses to rent to customers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-02T01:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ursula","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:46:25Z","rounded_local_amount":261.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012354},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:58Z","rounded_local_amount":261.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595942},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:31Z","rounded_local_amount":261.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990206},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:17Z","rounded_local_amount":261.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211331},{"amount":83.33,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:21:13Z","rounded_local_amount":261.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640845},{"amount":83.35,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":261.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080314}],"funded_date":"2009-04-07T02:03:45Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:32:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shanti Singh","image":286452}},{"id":102841,"name":"Nura","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Nura P., 35, is a tailor in the village of Khokhana-Dobato.

The income will allow him to take better care of his children's health, nourishment, and schooling.  \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

His wife Ana is his main support and between the two of them they work every day to improve their economic well-being.  They know that since they are young now they must do everything in their power to build a better future.  In the future, he wants to buy another car that he could rent out to obtain increased earnings and gradually build a better future for his family.\r\n\r\nRoberto has experience with loans from MFP; this is his 4th loan and his group does not have any problems, since all of his fellow members are very punctual with their payments.  With the money that he requests now he will refurbish his auto, which he owns.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":490546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"to repair his auto","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-18T17:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":90.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":90.63,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:27Z","rounded_local_amount":258.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993241},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:10Z","rounded_local_amount":258.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718024},{"amount":90.63,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:07Z","rounded_local_amount":258.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751700},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:02Z","rounded_local_amount":258.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934165},{"amount":90.63,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:01Z","rounded_local_amount":258.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672944},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:05Z","rounded_local_amount":258.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886728},{"amount":90.63,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:42Z","rounded_local_amount":258.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153815},{"amount":90.62,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:44Z","rounded_local_amount":258.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449214}],"funded_date":"2010-02-21T02:38:24Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":181427,"name":"Julia Amanda","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Esta cliente esta ubicada en la comunidad el espino y siempre se ha dedicado a la actividad agropecuaria\ny al desarrollo de su nivel de vida.\nEste credito le ha servido porque con las ganancia ha logrado comprar ganado y tambien preparar las condiciones para el desarrollo del ganado.","en":"\r\nThis client lives in El Espino;

The loan consultant who has been working with Ana over the past few months describes her as a humble, gentle woman who aspires to move up in the world.\r\n\r\nIn order to contribute to her family\u2019s income, Ana has a business selling various products including bags, clothing and sandals. This loan will be used to invest in the purchase of such products which Ana will sell to members of her community.\r\n\r\nAna sells her products from her house. When she makes sales on credits, her sons help her to collect on what is owed to her. One of her sons contributes to the family income and Ana also takes care of a child from the community in order to earn extra money.\r\n\r\nFor business advice, Ana consults her husband and sons, although she must execute all the daily tasks associated with her business on her own (her children are usually studying).\r\n\r\nAna would like very much to one day own a small restaurant or \u201csoda\u201d as they say in Costa Rica. She feels that such an enterprise would allow her to better provide for her children. She hopes to send as many of them as possible to university. In the meantime, Ana says business is going well and she hasn\u2019t had any problems yet.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":575231,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The official name of this borrowing group is Marilyn R.'s Group.\r\n\r\nMarilyn is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, she owns a general store selling a variety of different products.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from ASKI and is requesting a new loan of 7000 PHP to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the ninth loan taken out by Marilyn from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI: ASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He lives with Dionicia, his wife of 20 years.  The couple have 6 children, but only 2 of their children live with them: Javier and Fresia, who are still under their care.  The family lives in their own house in the community of Tapo.  Ignacio was born in Anta, a distant town.  His desire to grow motivated him to move to Tapo, which is closer to the city.  It was there that he learned what is now his passion: agriculture.  His main crops consist of corn and potatoes.  However, Ignacio is a very wise man, and he also installed a small garden where he grows all kinds of vegetables that the family consumes as food, thus minimizing the household\u2019s food expenses.  Over time he has managed to acquire 6 parcels of productive land, which he cares for with great dedication.  He also owns sheep and cows, which he raises to sell at a higher price.  These activities are going very well, and he hopes that with enough water and light he can get what he needs to improve his quality of life.  Ignacio belongs to the \u201cSanta Rosa\u201d solidarity group and this is his first loan with MFP, and he hopes that by working with them his plans can become a reality.  He promises to make his payments on time, as he has done with previous loans.  He also enjoys being part of his group because all of the members are responsible people and very supportive.  If Ignacio receives your support he will invest the money he is requesting in purchasing natural fertilizers that he will spread on his cornfields.

Many large supermarkets are being built in cities throughout Ukraine, but often small grocery stores close to where people live are much more convenient.<p>\r\n\r\nIrina had been a client with Nadiya Ukraine while she had her previous business. She established a good credit record and was able to obtain the necessary funding to start her new store. She has been in business at the new location for about 8 months. Her husband, Sergei, works closely with her and they are looking forward to seeing their enterprise continue to develop.<p>\r\n\r\nIrina has requested a loan for $900 that will allow her to increase the selection of goods she has available to sell. At this stage in her business development, it is important for her to offer a wide variety of items in order to establish a good reputation and attract more customers.

She has other debts in the same financial system that are still active and being paid back on time.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary McKee, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":335848,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"For purchase of Avon products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-17 -65","type":"point"}},"partner_id":73,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:18Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":249.44},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":256.1},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":262.92},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":269.94},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":277.13},{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":284.52},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":292.11},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":299.9},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":307.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.42},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.42},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.44},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.49},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.57},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.68},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.82},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.18}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75.83,"local_amount":505.54,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:49:17Z","rounded_local_amount":533.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63173252},{"amount":39.45,"local_amount":262.92,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:15:37Z","rounded_local_amount":277.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73598724},{"amount":40.49,"local_amount":269.94,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:29:01Z","rounded_local_amount":284.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87034297},{"amount":41.57,"local_amount":277.13,"processed_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:12:56Z","rounded_local_amount":292.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96946503},{"amount":42.68,"local_amount":284.52,"processed_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":300.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103788195},{"amount":43.82,"local_amount":292.11,"processed_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:10:02Z","rounded_local_amount":308.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110678348},{"amount":91.16,"local_amount":607.84,"processed_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":640.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118072907}],"funded_date":"2009-07-19T15:56:34Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:27:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary McKee","image":355625}},{"id":119241,"name":"Makerita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Makerita T., 53, is married with three children.

Each year, he produces a yield sufficient for his family's consumption and for selling. At the same time, he runs a business of raising and selling cattle. \r\n\r\nToday he is asking for a loan in the amount of 3,500 Somoni. Tilov would like to use this loan to buy supplies for the harvest and for improving production, and thus increase the quality of his yield along with his earnings at the time of sale.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The members learned about the loan program from announcements and from the coordinators.\r\n\r\nMarina is originally from Coapilla, Chiapas, 72 years old, and married since the age of 18 to Pedro from the same locality.  They have 7 children, all married now.\r\n\r\nMarina's motive for requesting a loan is to buy ingredients and make bread to sell. To do this, she needs wheat flour, cooking oil, eggs, milk, yeast, and sugar, plus other items.  She can count on the help of her husband who works in the countryside.\r\n\r\nMarina is very content with the service offered by the Fundacion Realidad (Reality Foundation). Her dream is to save in order to continue with her work.  Her 'illusion' is to travel to Cancun in Quintana Roo, and to keep her business until God takes her life.\r\n\r\nThe other 2 group members will utilize the loan as follows: Flor de Luz will buy creams, peroxide, hair coloring, and rollers for her beauty shop.  Her companion Magdali will use the loan to supply her taco shop. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Harold Sims, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":553360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"BUYING INGREDIENTS TO MAKE BREADS (SUGAR, EGGS, FLOUR, YEAST, OIL, AND MILK), AND OTHER SUPPLIES FOR 3 BUSINESSES ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COPAINAL\u00c1, CHIAPAS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-06-23T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flor De Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1125},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.63},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:50:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2288.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151899595},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2288.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159639942},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2288.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854224},{"amount":181.25,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2288.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121121}],"funded_date":"2010-06-23T23:56:53Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:11:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":214328,"name":"Moeun's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Moeun S. is 44 years old and is the village bank president, having been selected by its fifteen members who are located in Sdok Prei village, Takeo province.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

It was founded in 1961 and named after its founding mission. SLMB II caters to children between the ages of nine and twelve (classes four-six).  SLMB II has a total of 581 pupils with a staff of seventeen teachers and administrators. They are very proud of their 98% pass rate on the most recent National Primary School Exams (NPSE). Last year, of the 103 pupils sent to take the exams,102 passed successfully.   \r\n\r\nThis is the group's first loan with SMT.  They heard of SMT from colleagues in other schools who have benefited greatly from SMT\u2019s services. The use of the loan varies amongst the teachers.  Some of the staff members will start a small business.  Those who are already small business owners will invest the loan into their businesses. Some of the staff members will be using the loan to buy pieces of furniture for their domiciles and others plan to pay either for their children\u2019s education or to pursue further studies themselves. \r\n\r\nGovernment salaries are usually quite small for teachers, thus making teaching an unattractive profession for many whose primary motivator is money. Many choose other jobs over teaching because of the small salary, thus starving the field of qualified personnel to teach the children. The few who remain in the classroom have to find other ways of making ends meet. The vast majority of them engage in either business or agriculture or they provide extra tutorial classes for the children (though this is a practice the government is trying to stop). Needless to say, loans from SMT are a great help to the teachers in order to boost their businesses or invest it in something productive. Many want to go to school but could not afford the cost. Some will want to buy pieces of furniture, but their monthly salary is not enough to let them do so. With a loan, they will be able to meet some of these needs.  And with their monthly salaries, they can repay easily via a payroll deduction type of system.\r\n\r\nForty-one year old Francis T. (third from right) is the head teacher at SLMB II.  He was born in Makeni Yoni, a village about forty-three miles from Magburaka town. He is married to a teacher and the two have six children.  Three of his children are in primary school and three in secondary school. Francis will invest his loan in business. He has already been in business for two years now. He buys and sells palm oil, ground-nuts and rice. With this loan, he will invest all of it in palm oil alone. He is expecting to be able to get at least twenty-five \u201cbarters\u201d of palm oil (five gallons of palm oil make one barter). He purchases the palm oil in the nearby village of Makump, about nine miles round-trip from Magburaka.  A barter of palm oil costs something between Le 40,000 and 50,000. There are no constant prices; prices fluctuate depending on the season and the availability of the palm oil. Francis is very excited about this loan as the profit it will generate for him will make him \u201cfeel like I\u2019ve been a successful somebody in life.\u201d

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She continued taking short classes to improve her art and currently works in the style of Britto, a Brazilian artist, making principally necklaces that go well with her other beautiful accessories.

Besides the loans, FMSD has also helped her learn small business techniques through entrepreneurial training sessions and access to various fairs and special events. She is very open-minded and always trying to learn new things to improve her business and herself as a person. Shany wants to use this Kiva loan to buy materials to use in the creation of her handicrafts that she can then sell in Bogota at the Feria Empresarial de la Mujer (\u201cwomen's industry fair\u201d).\r\n\r\nShany's dream is to begin exporting her products, as well as to get her own store and home for her family.

This is especially true when she goes to fairs and needs to make a lot in advance. This loan will help her overcome that, ensuring rapid production of the anticipated handicrafts.

They live in their own home in a community in the central Peruvian jungle.\r\n\r\nNorly has been farming for ten years.  She grows coffee and bananas on her 5 hectares of farmland.  Her experience and commitment have allowed her to break into the business of selling fruit and, once a week, she travels to another town to deliver not only her own harvests but also the produce of other farmers from her town.  Norly tells us that she sells Seda and Isla bananas.  They are so good that on every journey she makes a net average profit of 150 to 200 Peruvian soles.  However, as a good businesswoman, Norly would like to invest in setting up a grocery store where she can offer staple food products since the area where she lives lacks a grocery store and the residents have to travel to the city to buy food.\r\n\r\nNorly is a member of the \"Las Palmas\" community bank.  This is her seventh loan from MFP and she shares new experiences in the constant meetings that she has with the members of her working group.  Her biggest financial income comes from her banana plantations.

They have a child named Anel and he is 15 years old. They live together in the community of Puerto Mayo in the district of Pichari. Although Elisa grew up surrounded by thatch and clay it did not mean that she would follow in down the same road. Therefore 10 years ago she started selling sweets outside a school located in her own community. In the past few years she opened a grocery store where she carries essential goods. Her husband helps her in attending the clients. She feels satisfied with her work especially because it generates and income and with it she is able to contribute towards the household expenses.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns & operates a business venture, selling fried foods in the local community.  She has 2 years of experience in this business.    Tauavae  needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase raw ingredients needed to make pancakes and german buns for sA..  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to pay for her children's tuition fees.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Tauavae  joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Tauavae 's 2nd loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated. \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nTauavae's Overall Social Metric Score:*               1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.3 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.8 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

He has been working as a taxi driver since 2007. Since there is almost no public transportation in the town, taxis are quite in demand and he is an experienced taxi driver. Due to health issues, he went to Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia for hospital treatment and got back after seven months of treatment. Since then, he has been working hard and recently he sold his old car for profit and bought a bigger car in order to serve his customers better.
