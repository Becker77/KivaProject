Ni Ketut Karni bought 2 mother pigs with a price of Rp600,000 (about US$66)\/piece, so for 2 mother pigs it was Rp1,200,000 (about US$132). The rest Rp700,000 (about US$77) was used to buy feed. Every day Ni Ketut Karni is busy with her animals besides being a mother raising 1 school aged child. According to Ni Ketut Karni raising mother pigs would bring faster results, because the 2 mother pigs will bore piglets and feed expenses would not be too high compared to fattening piglets. Usually every 5 months mother pigs could bore around 5-6 piglets per mother pig. From potential sales from 2 mother pigs could reach Rp2,500,000 (about US$275). Feed expenses only Rp500,000 (about US$55). So nett Ni Ketut Karni could profit Rp 2,000,000 (about US$220). With this profit Ni Ketut Karni likes to buy 1 more mother pig, to increase income and to enhance family life.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nDengan pinjaman modal yang di dapat dari Dinari sebesar Rp.1.900.000,- Ni Ketut Karni memulai usahanya. Ni Ketut Karni membeli 2 induk babi  dengan harga perekor Rp.600.000,- jadi 2 induk babi harganya Rp 1.200.000,-. Sisanya Rp.700,000,- dipergunakan untuk modal pakannya. Setiap hari Ni Ketut Karni  sibuk  mengurus usaha ternaknya disamping sebagai ibu rumah tangga yang mengurusi 1  orang anaknya yang masih sekolah. Menurut Ni Ketut Karni memelihara induk babi lebih cepat menghasilkan, karena nantinya dari 2 ekor induk babi ini akan beranak dan untuk biaya pakannya pun tidak terlalu mahal dibandingkan dengan memelihara babi pengemukan. Setiap 5 bulan induk babi ini akan melahirkan anak yang rata \u2013rata bisa beranak antara 5 sampai 6 ekor per induk dari hasil penjualan anaknya dari 2 induk babi pendapatan kotornya bisa mencapai  Rp 2.500.000,-. Pengeluaran pakan hanya Rp.500.000,-. Jadi bersihnya Ni Ketut Karni bisa  memperoleh keuntungan Rp 2.000.000,-. Dengan keuntungan ini Ni Ketut Karni ingin membeli induk lagi 1 ekor agar bisa menambah hasil dan memperbaiki kehidupan keluarganya."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":83952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To

She is married to a driver. Maureen runs a salon where she cuts both men and women\u2019s hair. She says she has been running the business for 19 years (since she was 10). Maureen says she is very talented and that in good months, like December, she will see lots of customers. Now, due to the loss of purchasing power, Maureen says she is only seeing one or two customers a day. She is asking for 30,000 KSH to purchase hair dryers and chemicals for her business.\r\n\r\nMaureen recently joined the K-MET volunteer Community Health Worker (CHW) group in Kisumu, Kenya. As a CHW she will be trained by K-MET and will begin visiting members of her community who are sick with a variety of illnesses. Her work will include distributing Nutriflour (a vitamin enriched flour produced by K-MET) to malnourished patients, providing reproductive health education, referring patients to local clinics and hospitals, and providing basic health care.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":303948,"template_id":1},"video":{"id":256,"youtubeId":"FnnWqGBSL4I","title":"Kiva Entrepreneur

A few years ago, she decided that she had to take a stronger role in providing for her family. As a result, she joined GHAPE in order to help her achieve this goal. Responding to this challenge, she started her own businesses and invested in developing her family farm. \r\n\r\nHaving already been a member of GHAPE for almost eight years now, Margarette has engaged in a number of different money making enterprises. She has sold cocoyams, and has also bought a motorcycle to help her transport her goods to market. With the profits of each of these ventures, Margarette has spent the money on her children\u2019s school fees and has also used this money to be able to feed and clothe the rest of her family. With the profits of her last loan, she also was able to bury her husband. \r\n\r\nWith this next loan, Margarette is looking to start a tire patching business in Ntarikon, a neighbourhood of Bamenda Cameroon. This tire patching business will succeed because of her collaboration with her first born son, a very energetic young man, and also because of her good business location. In addition to this, she feels that her tenacity, a trait learned over years of raising her children all by herself, will also provide her business with strength and vitality in the years to come. \r\n\r\nThrough this, she then will benefit the community in providing tire repair service, and will also be able to save people a significant amount of money over the full price of a new tire. Through the success of this venture, Margarette will also be able to put money directly back into the community through spending and employing other community members in the future. \r\n\r\nMargarette first came to GHAPE because of the quality of their training in business management, and also because of the low interest and easy payment plan. Through the success of these, she has become financially independent and has also been able to help some of her children start businesses of their own. \r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement. GHAPE instills a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":362269,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of working tools for tire patching, marketing ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntarikon, Bamenda, NW.

Uktam is a 40-year-old married man who lives with his 4 children. He has been running a business of raising and selling cattle. He has 12 years of experience in this field. Since cattle raising and selling is a profitable business, Uktam has become a very successful businessman in a very short period. He works very hard and spends all his time with the cattle, cleaning, feeding and pasturing them. \r\n<p>\r\nNow Uktam wants to expand his business and buy more cattle.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture, and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

H., 34, lives in Cayultit\u00e1n in the department of La Paz. He lives together with his wife and his two younger children, who are students. Tomas sells tamales which are filled with chicken meat. This type of meat is very appealing to people in this area, as his business is located in Olocuilta, a place that is very famous for their pupusas (thick tortillas typically stuffed with cheese, meat, and\/or beans) and is visited by many tourists from all over the country as well as foreigners. These tourists allow Tomas to sell great numbers of tamales. He is asking for a loan so he can buy greater quantities of corn to make the dough for the tamales and so he can buy more chickens and vegetables. The loan will allow him to increase the number of tamales he produces and thus take advantage of his client base and increase sales. The tamales are his only source of income with which to support his family. It is for this reason that Tomas must be able to improve the conditions of his business, as his family is completely dependent upon the profits generated by it. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She earns her living buying and selling dry goods.  Her husband Elmer, who is 35 years old, works as a vendor to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have five children who are 7 to 17 years old. Roxanne joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Roxanne has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 7,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 7th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000, which she intends to use to pay for more stocks for her business so that she can continue to save up for future education and expansion of her business. Roxanne is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

This is her fifth Kiva credit with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with which she will buy supplies like fabric, thread, and notions to make feminine dresses to sell to her clients so women can dress elegantly on Mother's Day.  With her previous credits, she increased her working capital and her family's income.  Her dream is to make improvements to her home until it is completely comfortable.

His business is located near a bus stop at Tudor Estate in Mombasa, Kenya, a coastal town that is well known for its many tourist attractions and white beaches. For the last 10 years, Safari has earned a living by selling rice, flour, oil, detergents, soft drinks and other items to people who live nearby. He says that this business is profitable, even though many people are in this line of work, which gives customers the ability to choose where to shop. Space is also difficult to find, and financial constraints have prevented him from expanding as much as he would like. Despite this, he works very hard to keep his business doing well. He has applied for a loan of Kes 40,000 to buy more items to sell. In the future, he hopes to become a wholesaler and have enough money to give his children a quality education. He believes he can do this because he is very hardworking and

Her husband Edwin V., who is 47 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living and also helps with his wife's business activities. They have two children, who are 20 and 23 years old. \r\n\r\nImelda joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 16 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Imelda has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 17,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,080 - uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her 17th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,500, which she intends to use to buy rice and other feeds so that she can continue saving for their future and expand the business. Imelda V. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

city of Valpara\u00edso.

M\u00f3nica works with her father in the business he has run for 30 years. M\u00f3nica is in charge of purchasing the ingredients to prepare <i>sopaipillas<\/i> (fried pastries), <i>empanadas<\/i> (stuffed savory pastries) and cakes.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, M\u00f3nica will purchase a fryer, because when they get a lot of orders for <i>sopaipillas<\/i> and <i>empanadas<\/i>, it takes a long time to fry them in a normal pan. She will also purchase aluminum plates, oil, and cheese in bulk, along with papaya jam and dough for the <i>sopaipillas<\/i> and <i>empanadas<\/i>.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to incorporate new products into the business; for example, an ice cream machine as they do not currently have one and it would be a good investment for the summer months to take advantage of the businesses location. In general, she would like to grow the business.\r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica\u2019s motivation comes from her children. She has one son who is 20 and in his third year of university, studying electrical engineering, and she has a 15-year-old daughter who also wants to continue on to college after finishing high school.  Her other daughter, who is 28, sells jewelry and is also part of the Fondo Esperanza communal bank.\r\n\r\nM\u00f3nica very much enjoys attending the weekly meetings of their bank because it gives her a moment to share with her friends and a distraction from day-to-day activities. \r\n\r\nValpara\u00edso is a city situated 120 kilometers to the northwest of Santiago, on the Chilean coast.  It is the regional capital of  \"Region Five\" and is the seat of the Chilean legislative government. Valpara\u00edso is the nation's primary port, and in addition to a bustling economy, it offers a great variety of beautiful and picturesque places, like the home of Nobel Laureate, the poet Pablo

Desde su ni\u00f1ez Erasma se ha dedicado a la agricultura, y los 40 a\u00f1os de matrimonio los ha dedicado a la siembra y cultivo de pl\u00e1tanos, c\u00edtricos y paltas. En aquellos tiempos la cosecha era buena, pero ahora solo conservan unas cuantas chacras, las cuales cosechan cada 15 d\u00edas y no les resultan rentables. Sus horas libres Erasma la dedica a  la fabricaci\u00f3n de javas y cajas para el guardado de frutas, ella y su esposo jam\u00e1s pensaron que este negocio les resultar\u00eda tan rentable, pero ahora tienen muchos pedidos, produciendo de 100 a 150 javas o cajones, que venden a un precio de de 90 c\u00e9ntimos y 1 sol dependiendo de la fruta que se empaque. Con esta actividad su esposo est\u00e1 muy feliz, ya que tiene el apoyo incondicional, de ella y la de su hijo, quien colabora con la fabricaci\u00f3n, juntos buscan clientes, para ofrecer su mercader\u00eda a un precio considerable; este negocio les est\u00e1 dando muchas alegr\u00edas, adem\u00e1s de permitirle ganar a la semana de 100 a 150 soles, dinero que cubre la alimentaci\u00f3n diaria de su familia.

Erasma tiene mucha gratitud a todos los que hacen posible este pr\u00e9stamo, ya que le permite seguir trabajando.","en":"Erasma is 55 years old and has been happily married since 1969.  She has one child and is currently living in a house she owns, where they prepare and sell crates of fruit.  Since she was young, Erasma has been working in agriculture and for the 40 years she has been married she has raised and harvested plantain, citrus fruit and avocado.  In those times the harvest was good but now they only have a limited number of fields which they harvest every 15 days and are not very profitable.  In her free time, Erasma makes containers and crates to keep the fruit.  She and her husband never thought this business would be as profitable as it has turned out to be and they now have good demand, creating between 100 to 150 containers or crates which they sell for 90 c\u00e9ntimos or 1 sol each depending on the fruit packed inside.  Her husband is very pleased with this activity  as he has her unconditional support and that of her child who also helps with preparations.  Together, they go looking for customers, to offer they merchandise for a good price.  This business is making them very happy and allows them to make between 100 and 150 soles a week, money which covers the daily food needs of the family.  Erasma has in past loan cycles been the group treasurer and she accomplished this task with great responsibility, ensuring the repayments were always recorded correctly.  This is her fifth loan with MFP with which she hopes to continue.  She will use most of the loan to buy materials to build crates and a smaller portion to buy fertilizers for her plantain fields.  Erasma is very grateful to all those who have made her loan possible as it will allow her to continue working.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":273386,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials to make crates to sell her fruit and vegetables","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-19T01:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Erasma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:35:38Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117097},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:45:32Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012010},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:33Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595595},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:57Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989857},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:38Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210993},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:22:05Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640494},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080123},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-10-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:04:41Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996410},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-11-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:53:49Z","rounded_local_amount":202.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103841943},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:17Z","rounded_local_amount":202.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733745}],"funded_date":"2009-02-19T05:28:49Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:22:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":93664,"name":"Alaimalo","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alaimalo F., 58, is married and has eight children.

Gargato, Hinigaran, Negros Occidental.  She may be a senior citizen with children ranging in age from 30 to 50, but she is a strong independent woman.<p>\r\n\r\nFlordeliza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon 16 years ago with the objective of setting up her own business and helping her husband support their family. She also liked the idea of being a member of an organization that empowers women out of poverty, and she used her first cycle loan to open a coffee shop adjacent to their house. With the help of her husband and children, she was able to build her business, and her coffee shop became a favorite among the locals, earning enough to be a significant help in meeting their family's expenses. <p>\r\n\r\nWhen her husband died, she was not left bereft as she had the means to continue supporting herself and her family. It also helped when her adult children started earning their own living, easing her financial burden.  As time passed, Flordeliza was able to buy a motorcycle with a sidecar for passengers which currently earns her additional income. Now that all of her children have their own families, Flordeliza is content that she is not a burden to them in her old age.<p>\r\n\r\nIn the 16 years that she has been a member, she has maintained a good credit record with NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her last loan of PHP 15,000 was fully repaid on time without any delays in the weekly installments. Now she is requesting another PHP 15,000 to add to her revolving working capital for her coffee shop.<p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to achieving realities beyond their dreams. They have learned to live a life where they can finally be called honorable.

Para el futuro tiene pensado crecer empresarialmente y ampliar su negocio, para hacerse conocida en su zona y captar mayor cantidad de clientes.Este es su onceavo pr\u00e9stamo  con MFP, y sabe que le ser\u00e1 de mucha utilidad para aumentar el capital de su negocio, por ello se compromete en pagar todas sus cuotas oportunamente.Mary tiene planeado invertir el dinero solicitado en la  compra de corrospum, al por mayor,  de diversos colores, adem\u00e1s de plumones acr\u00edlicos y pegamentos, que necesita para los acabados de sus materiales did\u00e1cticos. ","en":"Mary is 39 years old. She is a hardworking woman who lives with her mother and son in her own home.  For 10 years, she has been working in handicrafts made of corrospum (a micro-porous material similar to plastic). She is an expert in tracing and cutting didactic shapes, each one different from other creations. She makes all of her models without any visual aid; she just lets her imagination go.  She has contracts with some school teachers and mothers, to whom she sells her work. She remembers how years ago she worked alone and now her relatives help her to be able to finish her orders around holidays. She feels satisfied with her work because she does it in the calm of her own home without neglecting her housework- although she says it was more difficult to get a client base at first. For the future she plans to grow commercially and expand her business so that she becomes known in the area and can attract more customers.  This is the eleventh loan with MFP and she knows it will be very useful to increase her business' capital.  She is committed to making all of her payments on time. Mary plans on investing the money she has asked for in buying corrospum wholesale in different colors, in addition to acrylic feathers and glue, which she needs to finish her didactic material.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":565624,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials to continue her business.

The school is staffed with thirteen teachers and children between the classes of five and six from all primary schools in Makeni attend the school on alternate days of the week. \r\n\r\nThese hardworking and dedicated teachers have come to SMT, to seek a loan of SLL 3,000,000. This is not the first SMT loan that these teachers have benefited from: previous loans have made a lot of improvements in the lives of these borrowers. \r\n\r\nHelen F. (pictured second from the right) is the headmistresses and leader of this group of teachers. She is age forty-nine and has been in the teaching profession for twenty-four years now. She is married to a lecturer and they have four children, all of whom are in college.

It has produced famous thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural productivity and the manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent viable business prospects. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He lives with his elderly mother in the district of Pacora, a rural area, and has recently acquired access to electricity and drinking water. His community is small with approximately 200 families. Eduardo earns a living providing show repair services. His business is situated within his house. He has more than 20 years of experience in this trade, which he learned from his father, meaning he knows it perfectly. He is very well-known in the area and has an established clientele. He has continued to invest in his business, which has shown continual growth over the years. \r\n\r\nEduardo has requested a loan of 1,500 PEN to invest in the purchase of materials and equipment that he uses to repair shoes. He would also like to use a part of his credit to make some repairs to the floors, walls and door in the part of his house where he attends to clients. With this investment, he can provide a more professional service to his customers. Eduardo has very good personal and work references. He is a hard-worker and responsible.

 It has a very large lagoon that produces a lot of fish and work every year.  It is also known because the Cerro de Oro Hydroelectric Dam is located there.  Mr. Silvestre S\u00e1nchez, 32, lives in this community.  He studied up to 9th grade.  He\u2019s married and has three children who attend the local school in the community.\r\n\r\nSilvestre tells us: \u201cI have always worked but the economic situation is more and more difficult every day and money is never enough especially when one has children in school.  I talked to my wife and we decided that I\u2019d sell women\u2019s and men\u2019s clothes when I got off work in order to help ourselves out a bit more with household expenses and my children\u2019s schooling.\u201d \r\n\r\nSilvestre has been selling clothes for a little more than two years and he tells us that he sells them among his friends and neighbors in the community.  He says that it was difficult to acquire customers at first but now people know him and sometimes even come by his house looking for a blouse or a pair of shorts to give as presents at parties.  He needs this loan to invest in the purchase of blouses, skirts, shorts, underwear, pants, \r\nt-shirts, socks and dresses to sell later.\r\n\r\nHe hopes that with this investment his business will grow and produce good profits because he wants his children to have a better quality of life and study a profession in the future.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":212545,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To replenish her inventory of medicines","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-20T22:30:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-04T00:48:04Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:46Z","rounded_local_amount":60275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970648},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:10:16Z","rounded_local_amount":60275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886865},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:01Z","rounded_local_amount":60275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436125},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:34Z","rounded_local_amount":60275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130398},{"amount":50,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:11Z","rounded_local_amount":60275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027202}],"funded_date":"2008-10-20T23:48:04Z","paid_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":73200,"name":"Sadith Belmira","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Sadith pertenece al Banco Comunal \u201cCoraz\u00f3n D.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Later he found a job hanging electrical wires in another city and Primitiva was left to care for the fields. She cultivated the crops planted by her husband and with the help of laborers she also planted potato seeds that her husband had stored. Primitiva's husband has always been a man of faith and she believes that planting potatoes is profitable. Even though her current crop won't be large enough to sell for food, Primitiva would like to sell it for seed and continue to plant potatoes for the next harvest. Primitiva is happy to know that this community bank supports her, and because of the ease of paying with MPF she is prepared to repay her loan on the exact dates specified.

","en":"Eveline is 25 years old and the single mother of one daughter.  She currently runs a business making prepared foods in a rented space.  When she lived with her parents, she only dedicated herself to her studies.  However, once she had a child, she started her business from the rented locale in order to meet her financial needs.  She rented a location that is well-situated, through which a great number of people circulate as well as the buses and cars that travel between provinces.  In this way, the drivers of these vehicles became some of her best customers, and her restaurant is one of the most frequented in the area.  This has allowed her to pay the rent of 150 soles for her location, and also to support her daughter.  Eveline enjoys her work, which is why she starts as early as 5 am and closes at 9 pm when the buses stop running.  These days, business is not great and she sells 18 to 25 dishes.  However, during the coffee harvest season she sells upwards of 35 to 40 plates a day, allowing her to provide some comforts for her daughter.  Eveline has shown at all times to be punctual with her payments to MFP, and she is in her fifth loan.

She is 29 years old. Sheila is single and has two children. To make a living, Sheila owns and operates a specialized \"sari-sari\" retail store, selling retail products like such as soap, salt, sugar, noodles and other daily use products. Sheila has been in business for over five years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Sheila joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Sheila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. Sheila is requesting a new loan of 25,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Sheila from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

She is married and has a 13-year-old daughter who is in 9th grade.  She lives in Galapa, her home town, and one of the oldest in Atl\u00e1ntico department.  It is rich in cultural history, especially the wood and papier mache masks, woven reed crafts, sewing, painting on fabric, and dance.  These activities gather the traditions of its inhabitants and enrich Colombia\u2019s most famous festivals like the Carnival in Barranquilla, a city that is located 15 minutes away from Galapa.  Elizabeth Mar\u00eda finished second grade and taught herself in an empirical way how to communicate with her family and others using signs because, being hearing impaired, she never had the proper training in these skills.  But her family, who are her guiding posts with respect to her personal development, helped her to realize her potential by providing her with technical painting courses.  This allowed her, three years later, to be able to set up a small crafts business which consists of decoration and painting of fabrics.  With this, her self-esteem and her self-sufficiency grew.  Thus, with her immense desire to better herself and the loving support of her family, she learned how to sew on a family sewing machine and today she makes articles of clothing on which she applies the learned skills as value added.  These are alternative products that have expanded her market and that have been made possible thanks to financial support from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, with whom she has been associated for the last 3 years.  Currently, she hopes to receive a loan for $1.500.000 that will be repaid in 18 month.  45% of it will be used to buy felt appliqu\u00e9s, sequins, beads, and a variety of other appliqu\u00e9s specially selected to decorate homes and families during the Christmas season with tablecloths, cushions, sheets, comforters, towels, pillows, trivets, throw rugs, curtains, and pictures that beautify the homes of those that request them.  55% will be used to buy fabric to make dresses on order that her customers will wear during these festivities.  Elizabeth projects that this high sales season will increase her profits from which she will save enough to repay the loan, pay for her daughter\u2019s 2010 school expenses and still have some to reinvest for the January and February seasons that are approaching, which are related to back-to-school and Carnival in Barranquilla.  Elizabeth Mar\u00eda is an excellent family member and very responsible with respect to her financial obligations.  She has had 3 loans in the three years that she has been getting loans from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo; she has always repaid them in a timely fashion because she invests them in her business to grow and sustain herself.  She hopes in the not too distant future to have a workshop and a new sewing machine that will permit her to make still better finishings on her clothing and to strengthen  her market in nearby

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: dried fish vending, a general store and a fishing business. Her husband, Eufenio Y., who is 42 years old, works as a checker and as a Barangay (village) Councilor to earn his living. They have four children who are from 10 to 20 years old.\r\n\r\nCristina joined NWTF-Project Dungganon four years ago because she wished for something better for her family. With the help of her past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, she has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 22,500 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15,000, thus uplifting her family's standard of living.\r\n\r\nThis time, for her 10th loan, Cristina is borrowing PHP 29,500 which she intends to use to purchase raw materials like dried fish so that she can continue to save for the future education of her children and to put up her own general store.\r\n\r\nCristina is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Kevin inspects buildings for safety and regulation compliance, installs wiring for new construction, and repairs power outages due to on-site malfunction, in addition to installing and repairing solar panels and generators.  He started his business, Spark Electric, AC heating & Gas, in 2006.\r\n\r\nKevin\u2019s first job as a teenager was in the construction industry, though he later took jobs in other fields.  After overcoming personal struggles, Kevin returned to construction to open his own business.  For Kevin, small business ownership is more than a living.  He says that his success as a small business owner has given him confidence in what he can achieve professionally.  He is proud to be an integral part in his local economy, and feels connected to his community.  Kevin is also the proud father of three daughters.\r\n\r\nKevin wants his business to be more competitive in winning subcontracted commissions from commercial contractors.  Currently, Kevin estimates that 25% of his revenues come from work done on large commercial jobs, a number he hopes to improve upon this year.  Because subcontractors must wait to be compensated until the general contractor is paid, it is essential that they be able to front all of the costs and materials for a job.  This loan from ACCION Texas-Louisiana helps Kevin meet upfront business costs, building his credibility with commercial contractors.  In addition, this loan helps Kevin build his business credit so that he can qualify for more financing in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":762061,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electrician","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to pay for materials and operating expenses and to build credit","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"US","country":"United States","town":"Chalmette, LA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"39.76 -98.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":173,"posted_date":"2011-05-01T02:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":155.43},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":172.91},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":174.55},{"due_date":"2011-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":177.21},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":180.68},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":182.68},{"due_date":"2011-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":186.05},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":188.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":191.23},{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":194.74},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":197.12},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":199.07}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":155.43},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":172.91},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":174.55},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":177.21},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":180.68},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.68},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":186.05},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":188.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.23},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.74},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":197.12},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":199.07}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":356.65,"local_amount":356.65,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:23:59Z","rounded_local_amount":356.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216431419},{"amount":176.8,"local_amount":176.8,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:01:28Z","rounded_local_amount":176.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221596342},{"amount":178.5,"local_amount":178.5,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-29T07:41:22Z","rounded_local_amount":178.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226966218},{"amount":178.94,"local_amount":178.94,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-28T07:40:23Z","rounded_local_amount":178.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232725054},{"amount":185.09,"local_amount":185.09,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-23T08:44:34Z","rounded_local_amount":185.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238529103},{"amount":1124.02,"local_amount":1124.02,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-30T08:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":1124.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244488933}],"funded_date":"2011-05-04T16:09:46Z","paid_date":"2011-12-30T08:36:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kathleen Lukens","image":null}},{"id":299401,"name":"Bertha","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra Bertha de 37 a\u00f1os de edad, vive en la ciudad de Pimampiro, es casada y tiene un hijo que estudia en el colegio.

His spouse is a housewife and helps around the farm. In search of the source of income for his family, Ulukman started farming and raising livestock in 2007. Starting from 50,000 somons (KGS), today his farm brings a monthly profit of 5,000 somons (KGS). On his farm, he keeps one dairy cow and 20 sheep.

Married and the mother of  three, she is also the guardian of two other children.  Household  expenses became more burdensome, and her meager income was insufficient.  The family now lives in poverty.  Her husband lacks a steady job and does not help with the bills very much.  Ms. GAGA  finds herself trapped by these responsibilities and does not know what to do anymore.  Despite her courage and will, her family falls prey to daily problems.  She had benefited from a $450 loan that she handled and repaid in a satisfactory manner.

Despite his elementary education and old age, Fermin has been able to and continues to run his farm very effectively. It has always provided for him and his 5 children. Although they are all grown up now, his kids still help in the farm and some even still live at home. To them, the \"hacienda\" is more than a home, as it has been in the family for over 40 years and it also puts food on the table. He hopes he can invest in seeds and fertilizer for the next planting season. <\/p>\r\n<h4>The Santa Lucia Communal Bank<\/h4> \r\n<p> Fermin is part of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. Their association works cooperatively to help in the commercialization of the product after it has grown. They will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical micro-entrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan.

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":212574,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fuel\/Firewood","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stock of charcoal.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-10-14T16:40:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-28T23:54:39Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:22:55Z","rounded_local_amount":81371.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348077},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-17T09:14:30Z","rounded_local_amount":81371.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970663},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:16:28Z","rounded_local_amount":81371.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886880},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:05:01Z","rounded_local_amount":81371.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436140},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:56Z","rounded_local_amount":81371.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130413},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:26:23Z","rounded_local_amount":81371.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027215},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:15:01Z","rounded_local_amount":81371.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613253},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-06-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:03:15Z","rounded_local_amount":81371.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010336},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-07-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":81371.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232647},{"amount":67.5,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-08-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:54:27Z","rounded_local_amount":81371.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664463}],"funded_date":"2008-10-14T23:54:39Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:54:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Brooks","image":643421}},{"id":73216,"name":"Mar\u00eda Castillejo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria es socia D.

She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her businesses.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her businesses, Ma. Luisa would like to apply for a PHP 30,000 loan.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Teresita has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Teresita joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teresita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Teresita is requesting a new loan of 14,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This loan will be the fourth loan taken out by Teresita from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

T. (7) is a 33-year-old woman living in the town of Thanh Hoa.  Tien is the group leader of a 5-member group loan offered by Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.  The official name of this borrowing group is 08.1.2 Nam Ngan (02.08.1.2 Nam Ngan).\r\n\r\n\r\nTien is married and has 1 school-aged child.  To make a living, Tien owns & operates a tailoring business.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing general  alteration & tailoring services to local community members.  Tien has been engaged in this business for over 5 years and earns approximately 2,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Tien joined Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Tien has successfully repaid a previous loan of 3,079,800 VND from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  This previous loan was used to purchase a new sewing machine.  She is now requesting a new loan of 6,000,000 VND which will be used to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  This will be the 4th loan taken out by the borrower from Thanh Hoa Fund for Poor Women.  Tien plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the Other Borrowers in the Group:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  P. T.

She buys fabric from Kiyembe shops in Kampala and uses public transport to and from shopping.\r\n\r\nBesides this clothing business she owns a public pay phone which brings in additional income. She sells her uniforms to all categories of people at retail prices. She works six days a week and depends on this job for a living.  Her business challenge is the seasonality.  She is hoping to see her business grow big so that she can get enough profit to buy a plot of land to build rental rooms. \r\n\r\nShe decided to join MCDT because she wanted additional capital for her business.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They are all married and mothers of at least four children.  To expand their work, they have decided to join the Soro Yiriwaso loan program, which they discovered over a year ago.  Their principal work involves the sale of beignets (a kind of doughnut) and meat.  At the crossroads early in the morning, they sell beignets with well-done sheep\u2019s head, which is a breakfast highly appreciated by the town\u2019s inhabitants.  \r\n<p>\r\nBeignets are made of millet or rice, which are purchased wholesale from peasants at the village fair at affordable prices.  The current loan will be used to buy sacks of rice and millet and drums of cooking oil.  The estimated profit is 110,000 francs CFA per member.  This profit will be used to pay the loan interest and to take care of family expenses.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":260466,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy rice, millet, and cooking oil ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Assanatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Koninba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mamin\u00e8","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adiaratou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":84064.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440344},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:07:42Z","rounded_local_amount":84064.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135722},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:27:55Z","rounded_local_amount":84064.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033523},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:42Z","rounded_local_amount":84064.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620891},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:16Z","rounded_local_amount":84064.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019856},{"amount":166.66,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:18:47Z","rounded_local_amount":84064.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242614}],"funded_date":"2009-02-02T19:28:42Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T19:18:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":89616,"name":"Phea's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Phea M. is a group leader of five who all live in Tropeang Srongae village in Kampong Chhnang province.
