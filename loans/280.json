She is 43 years-old and a trader in clothing materials. She trades in lace materials, textiles and clothing. Lace material is very useful in room and office decorations.  She also sells cooking utensils. For lack of adequate working capital, she buys little stock and sells in the community market. She believes the loan will enable her to grow her business to the expected level. With the loan, she plans to purchase bulk cooking utensils, lace materials and textiles. She hopes to use part of her profit to expand her store. \r\n<p>\r\nShe is the leader of a trust bank group called \"Ye bi ma\" which means to give support.

She owns a business planting and harvesting taro for sale.  Nora has 3 years of experience in this business.  Nora needs a loan of WST$2000 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 120 talas or US $50 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Nora  joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.  SPBD's loans are Nora's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Her husband Eliseo N., who is 63 years old, is retired and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have eight children who are between 13 to 32 years old. Jovita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past twenty loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Jovita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 16,000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 8,000 PHP, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 21st loan, she is borrowing 16,000 PHP, which she intends to use to buy more fresh fish to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children and home repairs. Jovita N. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

The members live in the municipality of Tecoanapa Guerrero and decided on this name for the group because it is the name of the community where the majority of the members live.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Maribel C. L. is the representative of the group and this is her story. She is 38 years old, married, and has four children: Alejandra, Eduardo, Estefan, and Luceli. They all attend school; the eldest is in first year college, the second in second year of high school, the last two are in the fourth and sixth year of primary school. Maribel\u2019s job is selling cosmetics from a catalog.\r\n\r\nShe decided to start this business because she needed to provide a better standard of living for herself and her family and to help her children get ahead. As she could not afford to educate her children well nor assist her husband with household expenses, she took on a loan to buy catalogs and more merchandise such as lipstick, blush, eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara to start the business.\r\n\r\nShe says that the business has helped her a lot and she now can pay for her children\u2019s studies and improve their quality of life. The money she earns has improved the family\u2019s financial situation and she is now saving to buy a stove since the one that she has is very old.\r\n\r\nSra. Maribel wishes to invest more money in her business so that it can expand much more. For that reason she wants to build a bigger store from which to sell her beauty products. She will be able to have a greater variety and thus increase sales and income. Then she can continue helping her children through school so they can get good jobs and have a better future.\r\n\r\nMaribel says that all the members of the group are responsible people who pay back their loans. They all know each other since they\u2019re from the same community and they are all friends so there are no problems between them. Up to now no one has failed to make their repayments as they are responsible, punctual and hardworking.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe members of the Las Animas group and the business in which they will invest their loan:\r\nMar\u00eda Victoria Angel B.-selling sandals\u2028\r\nRafaela G.

Her husband\u2019s experience in this line of work has been very helpful for her to launch this business.  She\u2019s been in it now for 7 years designing beautiful wood items of home furniture.

In 2003, while looking for income source for her family, Zinat started her own business in raising livestock with the initial investment of 10,000 KGS. Because of her perseverance and persistence, she currently owns 4 cows, 8 sheep, 8 goats and is earning around 7,000 KGS per month from the sale of dairy and meat products. The income from this business allowed Zinat to pay for her children's education and do small repairs in her house. In order to further develop her business, Zinat came to \"Bai Tushum & Partners\" for a loan of 55,000 KGS to purchase sheep.  In the future Zinat wants to increase her property and expand her

For the past year, Norah has been actively involved in mixed farming. Nkubu is one of the places with conditions that favor horticulture farming: good climate, soils, transport system, and market. Norah has always wanted to diversify and start horticultural farming, but the biggest challenge she has been facing is lack of funds. She is therefore requesting a loan to buy seeds and start horticultural farming. Through Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance organization that supports young and enterprising farmers she has received training on horticulture farming.

Furthermore I am going to work with more responsibility and save with more confidence because for the first time I have participated in an institution where they have returned my savings without any problems.\""}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1450,"image":{"id":182967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Grow fruits and vegetables; raise livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2008-07-19T17:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1450,"lender_count":46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Charo","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Josefina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Francisca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Gudelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Estela Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rofina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lisbet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-03T19:36:28Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":4100,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":683.33},{"due_date":"2008-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":683.33},{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":683.33},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":683.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":683.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":683.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":241.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":241.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":242,"local_amount":684.28,"processed_date":"2008-09-03T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T01:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":688.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315135},{"amount":242,"local_amount":684.28,"processed_date":"2008-10-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-10T07:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":688.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346674},{"amount":240.99,"local_amount":681.43,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:57:03Z","rounded_local_amount":685.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5314513},{"amount":241.67,"local_amount":683.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":687.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9932130},{"amount":241.67,"local_amount":683.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T12:05:05Z","rounded_local_amount":687.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10214498},{"amount":241.67,"local_amount":683.35,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:21:20Z","rounded_local_amount":687.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20396310}],"funded_date":"2008-07-20T19:36:28Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T08:21:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":61554,"name":"Aruwa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aruwa is 32 years old, married, and has 5 children between the ages of 2 and 14.

Maria learned to sew as a young girl but, because her family was humble and poor, she did not have a sewing machine.  Through her solidarity group with ADIM, she was able to get a loan to buy a machine, and she repaid the loan very responsibly.   Maria feels her greatest achievement as a woman is having started her own business.  She considers it to be one of the most important things that has happened because she has a large clientele for her business which is located in the market of Masaya.

Some will pay school fees either for themselves to pursue further studies or for their children. Some will use the loan to buy pieces of furniture like a bed or chairs.

The doughnut is a popular breakfast snack taken with tea. Her day starts early due to the high demand for the snack in the morning. Her target market includes people going to work and school-going children who are early risers. \r\n\r\nFlorence is taking out a third loan from KADET Ltd having fully serviced a previous loan without difficulties. She intends to buy baking flour and cooking oil. Her business is growing because the mandazi are preferred over bread. This is confirmed by the great number of customers, mostly women, flocking to her stall to buy hot snacks for breakfast. The preparation of the doughnuts has become Florence's largest source of income and she hopes to use her profits to pay her children's school fees.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to epic mountain passes, a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC, and communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

So, they decided to purchase additional sheep to increase the family income and satisfy the basic family needs. \r\nShe applied for credit to Agroinvest, where she requested 1100 USD for that

C. V. is 20 years old and is married with two young children.  She and her husband raise sheep to sell. With this loan she will buy 5 to 10  more sheep depending on the cost. They will be grazed in the highlands around her home where the rainy season turns the entire area into wonderful pastureland.<p>This is Teresa's first credit cycle with Friendship Bridge, and it's a little scary thinking about having to come up with the payments.  She joined the program with the hopes to build toward having enough to provide for her family: to buy enough food, a house which does not leak in the rain, and to send her children to school when the time comes. At this time her health and her family's health are good and they have no problems.  Her hope is that the lambs will grow and not get sick and she'll be successful with the loan.<p>Teresa is a member of the women's group Nueva Vision, or New Vision. Most of the women in her group, even the younger ones, cannot read, write, or speak Spanish. They primarily stay with their traditional ways and speak their native Ixil language. Until very recently, almost all the houses in this remote village were made of wood, a very poor building material for this area, but now most are of concrete block and adobe. The change is that many of the younger men are now working in another country and they send money home to their families, enabling the families to improve their housing. <p>Interviewed by Juana Cedillo in the Ixil language.<br\/>Written by Nancy Lewis and Randy Fay, Kiva Fellows"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":55082,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase and raise 5 lambs","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Nebaj, Quiche","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15.405833 -91.146111","type":"point"}},"partner_id":55,"posted_date":"2007-08-21T05:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-09-04T10:34:43Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":275,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2007-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2007-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":30.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.56},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":30.52}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2007-10-04T09:20:39Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":62888},{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2007-11-04T10:22:59Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":76296},{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2007-12-04T10:21:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":91274},{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2008-01-04T10:18:41Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":108186},{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2008-02-04T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128159},{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2008-03-04T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":149182},{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2008-04-04T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":173493},{"amount":31,"local_amount":31,"processed_date":"2008-05-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":200684},{"amount":27,"local_amount":27,"processed_date":"2008-06-04T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-06-04T09:25:13Z","rounded_local_amount":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227830}],"funded_date":"2007-08-21T10:34:43Z","paid_date":"2008-06-04T09:07:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":20605,"name":"Pascuala","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"PASCUALA  is 35 years old, separated, with three children.

The price goes up when they are in season from December to March, and is lower the rest of the year, but he always earns enough for his necessities.  \r\n\r\nThe hard part about citrus is that they take 3 to 5 years to develop, which is why he sows rotating crops and a variety of produce.

Occidental. He earns his living driving a passenger tricycle and selling chicken and pork barbecue as well as Ready-To-Wear (RTW) clothes.\r\n\r\nRoberto\u2019s wife, Christina, helps in running the business. They have one child who is 2 months old. The couple is striving hard to provide their child with a good future. Roberto G. joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 with the hope that he would be able to improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of his loans from NWTF-PD, he has been able to increase their family income by engaging in chicken\/pork barbecue sales, driving a passenger tricycle and selling RTW. Now he earns an average monthly income of 10,000 Philippine pesos from his business activities.\r\n\r\nRoberto is a member in good standing. His previous loan of Php 18,000 was used to maintain his tricycle and to add capital to his chicken\/pork barbecue and RTW businesses, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now he is borrowing, for his seventh loan, the amount of Php 19,000, which he intends to use for tricycle maintenance and the chicken\/pork barbecue and RTW businesses. Roberto is working hard to achieve his dreams and aspirations for his family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":478931,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle

the town of Melaya in northwest Bali. These women manage various types of businesses ranging from shop traders, to cattle and pig farmers, to produce sellers. The group, which is led by a chairwoman and treasurer (pictured above) requested a loan of Rp. 9,999,990 which will be distributed to the group members according to their individual needs and business skills.\r\n\r\nThe chairwoman of the group is responsible for the borrowing of all the members and to share the money equally in accordance with their business needs. At the end of the loan period, the chairwoman and treasurer will collect the repayments from each member in a group meeting.\r\n\r\nOne of the members of the group is Ni Komang Karleni who has a business in the school cafeteria. Her portion of this loan is Rp. 350,000 which will be used to buy foods that are sold such as rice packets, fried noodles, chicken soup, porridge, various snack foods and soft drinks. Each day she begins selling at 6 a.m. Her clients are mostly school children, but also people from the area. Her efforts are in demand because her food is very good and cheap.\r\n\r\nNi Komang Karleni\u2019s income per day is approximately Rp. 60,000. Her income goes towards capital for her shop, everyday needs, and personal savings. She was only educated through junior high school level so she wants her son to be able to attend school up to university level so he can improve his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote to Kiva Lenders:  \r\nThis group uses a community lending model (commonly referred to as Village Banking) that is very common throughout Asia. In this model, a select number of group representatives will take out a large loan on behalf of their entire group (often an entire village). They will then distribute and manage the loan and collect repayments for the lender.\r\n\r\nThis is a common and efficient practice in the region, but it makes reporting on Kiva somewhat unusual. Unlike most other loans, Kiva\u2019s partner, MUK, will be in contact primarily with the group leadership team who in turn will be overseeing the end borrowers. As such, journal updates likely will reflect the performance of the lending group rather than the individual end borrowers.\r\n \r\nTo learn more about Village Banking on Wikipedia, please click here.\r\n"}},"status":"deleted","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":490115,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy foods that are sold in her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Komang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Wayan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni  Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nyoman","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Nengah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Luh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Ketut","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ketut ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ni Putu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":9999990,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":9999990}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":181116,"name":"Myrna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Myrna P., is a rice grower from Norala, South Cotabato.

He is single and lives with his older brother in a beautiful house that he built with own hands.  His parents live on a farm where they tend to their crops.\r\n<p>\r\nEdwin\u2019s curiosity motivated him to become an expert in building things made of wood.  His uncle taught him this trade and he later perfected his skills at a specialized technical institution.  For the past five years, he has constructed houses, schools, and has built all types of furniture.  At the same time, he grows coffee and bananas on his own land.  These activities are profitable enough to allow him to live comfortably.  He hopes to find a wife so that he can start his own family.\r\n<p>\r\nThe part he enjoys most is varnishing his creations because it is the final stage when he can appreciate the work that fills him with pride.  Over time he expects to finish the construction of his house, buy more land for farming, and acquire a truck so that he can transport his products to the capital of Lima.  This will generate better profits as well as help his neighbors and bring progress to his community.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his second loan with MFP.  Edwin is aware that he must be responsible and punctual with his payments so that his Communal Bank won\u2019t look bad.  The other members greatly appreciate him.

They have two children who are 13 and 16 years old respectively. \r\n\r\nErma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past six loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Erma has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 12,500 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 6,400, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for her seventh loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use to purchase products for her general store and rice to resell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nErma T. is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

She has been in this business for 4 years and considers the most difficult bit of her work to be the fact that she has to stay in her store all day long without being able to go out and do other things.

For more than 2 years, this enterprising woman has sold clothes, sheets, bedspreads, and shoes. She buys once a month at a big commercial center in the city and she brings back on order different types of garments; and then her customers pay her on credit. She really likes her business as it is peaceful and it allows her to look after her small children; in additional it generates a considerable profit which enables her to help her husband with the constant household expenses. What she doesn't like is that some customers fall behind in paying their debts, which then ties up her capital, but in the end they are settled with interest. She has a lot of plans for the future like setting up a stall selling clothes at the market in her area, and she knows that with a lot of effort she will succeed. This is the second loan that she has had with MFP and she promises to pay her installments on time as she doesn't want to give a bad impression to the people who have made this support possible which allows her to keep working in search of progress. Gisela plans to use the requested loan to purchase clothing and shoes which she needs to offer the best to her customers; in addition she needs to stock up for the Christmas campaign. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":657720,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase clothing and shoes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-05T00:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gisela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.62},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.63},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":177.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463593},{"amount":62.62,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":177.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886977},{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:23:47Z","rounded_local_amount":177.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327332},{"amount":62.62,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:57Z","rounded_local_amount":177.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195897},{"amount":62.63,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:47Z","rounded_local_amount":177.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269564},{"amount":61.87,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:46Z","rounded_local_amount":174.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549573}],"funded_date":"2010-12-07T23:06:02Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catherine Dent","image":null}},{"id":259097,"name":"Leonid","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Leonid is married with two grown children.

He is married and has one child. His transportation services are always in demand, which helps Tohirjon make good money and run his business efficiently. Tohirjon has been in this trade for six years. He seeks a loan of $2,000 USD to replace his car with a new one. He is hoping to continue running this business as it brings good income for him and for his family. Tohirjon is an experienced technician and knows a lot about vehicles.

Tohirjon is happy to have this business as it feeds his family and helps him to survive in this challenging economic environment.\r\n \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Currently she lives alone.  \r\n\r\nMagdalena tells us that she has always worked, since she likes to keep busy, especially since her husband died around 8 years ago.  In the afternoons she sold chicharrones (pork rinds) and slices of watermelon to earn a bit of extra money. Eventually, she began to sell a few groceries in the hallway of her home. Gradually, as sales were good, she built a small store in front of her house, where she continued selling groceries.

She has been married for 2 years, and from this marriage has a son, Kelvin, who she cares for in her own home in the rural Cayan settlement.  The struggle to provide for her family is her main virtue.  From the time she was married, she began to cultivate her lands, scattering potato seeds of every variety and quality.  According to her, every morning she goes out to care for and clear her croplands; she harvests her crops after many months of work.  She now has 3 years of experience in farming, and what she likes the most is to be able to see her crops grow little by little.  What she dislikes is when she has to cut the price of her products in the market.  But, as she is an intelligent woman, she finds other ways to generate income, such as caring for the bulls and cows that she has.  According to her, now one of her cows is pregnant, so very soon she will have enough milk to make the rich cheeses that only she knows how to prepare.  She belongs to the communal bank \"Progreso Cayan\" and this is her first loan with MFP, where she awaits the support of all of you so that she can continue to realize her goals.  In addition, she promises to be on time with her payments.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is known for being a devoted mother and homemaker. She learned farming work when she was very young since her father taught her this work. Although her job requires sacrifice, she likes it. Perhaps this is why she protects from harm her crops of avocados, bananas, and citrus fruits. Her husband accompanies her every working day. Along with this job, she raises hens and pigs which are then sold in the city market and whose earnings help her with some inexpected problems since she doesn't want to take her savings that are intended for the purchase of productive land where she will renew and alternate new products that grow in the area. This is her sixth loan with MFP and she is satisfied to belong to her community group since it is a very unified group with a log of desire to get ahead. With the loan that she is requesting, she will purchase 20 sacks of fertilizer to level the production of her crops.           \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":525201,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Comprar 20 sacos de fertilizantes.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-04-18T21:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teodora ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":525}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":525,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1501.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886326}],"funded_date":"2010-04-18T23:43:56Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:28Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":197650,"name":"Ana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ana P. is from the village of Brgy.

His experience in the trade was acquired when he worked for 9 years in a large footwear company which operated an industrial free-trade zone.  There, in spite of being in an administrative position, he learned all the techniques and stages of the production process.  After leaving the company, he perfected his knowledge by attending a number of shoemaker's courses in the Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje, SENA (the National Apprenticeship Service).  \n\nCurrently Edgardo produces all kinds of footwear which he sells by the dozen in stores and warehouses across the city.  He makes his sales for cash and occasionally allows 30 to 45 days for his customers to pay.  His average profit margin is 43% and his monthly sales are on average $2,700,000.  His workshop, although it is small, has an industrial sewing machine and all the manual equipment he needs to produce any type of footwear.  Normally Edgardo works alone but in the end-of-year season his orders usually increase considerably and he hires an assistant who helps him cut his synthetic material and leather.\n\nThis is Edgardo's first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He is requesting $1,000,000 which he plans to invest in the purchase of leather, synthetic material, rubber, soles and iron fittings.  Edgardo says that one of his biggest achievements has been to sell his products in spite of the strong competition which he has seen from imports of similar products at lower prices but of inferior quality.  He dreams of having a larger shoemaker's workshop, equipped with modern machinery and many employees.  With his small workshop, Edgardo has managed to pay for his children to study in higher education which is his biggest

Together, the couple meet the various household expenses. \r\n\r\nAlmost nine years ago, Sylvie and her family settled in Logbozounkpa, in the community of Abomey Calavi. Her work involves selling cloth, hair extensions, and shoes via the distribution system. This helps her to support herself and her children. She buys her products in Nigeria, a state neighboring Benin.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of bolstering her business and satisfying her customer base, Sylvie, along with the other group members, is requesting a loan from ALID\u00e9. Her ambition is to strengthen her business further, so as to grow her revenues.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":754104,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to

Oretha does not get financial support for her children from their father. She also cares for her mother.\r\n\r\nOretha's business is the sale of foodstuffs such as flour, sugar, butter, beans and rice.

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ignacia M. is from the village of Rizalina. She is 63 years old. Ignacia is the group leader of a 3-member group loan offered by PMPC. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nIgnacia is married and has 4 adult children. To make a living, Ignacia owns & operates a business selling food, primarily snacks & other delicacies, that she sells in the local community. Ignacia has been engaged in her business for over 4 years and earns approximately 2,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Ignacia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Ignacia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. Ignacia is requesting a new loan of 3,000 PHP, which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Ignacia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":525222,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

N. is forty years old, married and has three children aged between the ages of nineteen years old and fifteen years old. Her business is located at Murera Juja a very busy market at Thika. She operates a hardware store in which she has been selling pipes, bicycle spare parts and other items. She has been selling to the local people for the last five years.\r\n\r\nShe has provided employment to one person. She says that this business is profitable, and the major challenge she has is insecurity in the area. However, she works very hard to keep her business doing well.

Located among majestic baobab trees about 20 miles inland from the beach resort area of Mbour, Louly Ngokom is a poor village that depends on its youth in the cities to send money and rice home in the hungry months of August and September. In the summer of 2004, villagers lacked capital to buy seeds to plant their main cash crop, peanuts. For the initial lending, 15 household heads were chosen by Doudou and a counsel of village elders to receive a loan of $25 each to purchase of seeds before the planting season. After the harvest, 99.5% reimbursed the loans with an interest rate of 6%. In 2005, with continuing donations through John Fay, GENSEN and the village counsel were able\u00a0to increase\u00a0the loan and the number of beneficiaries to 33 persons, 17 men and 16 women selected on a rotating basis. <br \/><br \/>In its goal of becoming a self-sufficient model village, Louly has in its favor a partnership with a new modern ecovillage group, introduced with the facilitation of the GENSEN NGO, SOS Environment. In fact, the ecovillage of Louly Ngokom consists of the existing traditional inhabitants plus this new group of about 20 incoming settlers, who already have started to employ local youth to grow organic bananas and produce and to construct modern ecological dwellings.

graduating from school Shoira A. got married. Her husband used to work seasonally (he helped his uncle to grow grapes). After the birth of their 4th child, Shoira had to begin trading at the market while her oldest daughter took care of the children. Initially, Shoira purchased goods from wholesale traders, but the prices were very high when she had to take out loans. In the summer of 2006, she found out about a credit program called \"Microinvest\". After receiving her first loan, she was able to secure lower prices for the goods she purchased wholesale, which allowed her to gain additional income. One part of the income was spent on family needs and the remaining part Shoira invested in her business. In order to be more competitive in her business, she plans to travel to Bishkek (Kyrgyz Republic) to purchase goods. This way, she will expand to a wholesale business. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Russian by Anna Startseva, Kiva Volunteer.<b><p>\r\n\r\n\u0410\u044e\u0431\u0447\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430
