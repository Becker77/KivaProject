small-scale relief and rehabilitation project in 1972 to help the country overcome the devastation and trauma of the liberation war and focused on resettling refugees returning from India. Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Dia berjalan keliling dari satu tempat ke tempat lainnya mencari barang bekas dan rongsokan. Barang bekas seperti besi, karton, kaleng, kertas dan lain-lain nantinya akan dijual lagi ke penadah. Sarana yang dipakai sehari-hari adalah gerobak dorong untuk menampung barang bekas hasil cariannya. Mulai dari pagi jam 5, dia sudah siap berkeliling sampai siang hari jam 12. Setelah beristirahat 1 jam, dia berangkat lagi jam 2 dan pulang jam 5 sore. Penghasilan yang didapat perhari sekitar Rp.50.000. Keuntungan yang didapat dari usahanya dipakai untuk kebutuhan sehari-hari dan membiayai sekolah anaknya, Delta yang saat ini sudah di bangku SMP.

The official name of this borrowing group is Nila I. Group.\r\n\r\nNila is married and has seven school-aged children. To make a living, Nila plants and harvests rice for sale. Nila has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Nila joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Nila has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Nila is requesting a new loan of 11000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the 9th loan taken out by Nila from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

All of whom are still going to school and need her support.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Lorenda is busy with the buying and selling of bamboo craft and charcoal to earn the means of daily living. When she received a small amount of capital from ASHI, she managed to put it all into her business. For her, business is an important factor, and she does not want to be a problem for her group mates with the weekly loan obligations.\r\n\r\nShe applied for a new loan amounting PHP 20,000.00 to have additional working capital for her business. Specifically, the loan fund will be use to purchase inventory of bamboo crafts and charcoal to sell.\r\n\r\nLorenda is a very good member of ASHI. She performs well in her business. When she has enough capital, she increases her business in order to gain more income. She hopes that through her loans availed in the ASHI partnership with KIVA; someday she will be able to save money as she is getting older. Along with the business success she is dreaming about, is the hope to see the graduation of her children at college and to see them find stable jobs.

His first child is 10 years old, the next is two years old, and the third is one years old. Jean Pierre is a businessman. His wife is jobless. Jean Pierre owns a business selling foodstuffs such as beans, rice and so on. These products are profitable, which is the reason he has chosen this kind of business.

For them the sensational phenomenon of dawn is linked to the hopes and expectations that each one of them has to arrive at a new day and just like interest is renewed so is the grace of living one more day in humans.  This is how the members explain the meaning of the name.  It is composed of 10 women and one man.  All are from San Miguel Tlacamama located 25 minutes from Pinotepa Nacional, Oaxaca.  It is known for the cheeses made in the area that are highly appreciated by locals.  Most of the people are associated with cheese making and also farm work.  The group meets in one of the member\u2019s homes where cheese is made daily.  The group representative is Minerva Irma E. Mart\u00ednez but in this case we will emphasize another group member\r\n\r\nMartha L. A., 34, is a hardworking housewife.  She is the daughter of humble field workers and is married to Javier, 35.  She is the mother of four children: Ana Laura, 16, Marisol, 15, Honorio, 11 and Gustavo, 3.  Only two of them go to school because the oldest was unable to go to school this year due to lack of resources; she helps her mother in the small business they have.\r\n\r\nMartha has been selling low-cost meals for over two years.  This activity has become her source of income.  Profits are directed primarily to provide continuity to the business, to repay her loan and to pay for her children\u2019s educational expenses.  It is also a way to help her husband because his salary as an employee is insufficient to cover the needs of four children and themselves.  This is why she decided to go into this business which, although it is close to home, still implies much work and dedication because her meals stand out due to their special savory touches.  We can find her daily at her business cooking up soups, mole and adobo and in the evenings, regional snacks like sopes, tacos and tostadas.\r\n\r\nMartha joined the group in order to obtain credit to invest in her business.  With money she was lent she bought some ingredients like: assorted chilies, tomatoes, onions, vegetables, fruits, leafy vegetables and grains like beans, rice, corn to make tortillas, oil, salt, sugar and canned goods.  To date everything in her business is running very well and she expects tourists and people on vacation to come through town during the next vacation period.\r\n\r\nShe hopes that her daughter will be able to restart her schooling next term and that the business continues to grow; that her sales don\u2019t drop so that she can continue to guarantee a good living condition for her family.  She\u2019d like to have a restaurant where she does not have to pay rent that would mean a solid support for her family.\r\n\r\nWhat Martha can add now is that thanks to the collaboration from all the good and noble people she has been able to improve the living conditions of herself and her children.  She thanks the people who gather together to do good for others.  She sends greetings to everyone that supports Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and asks God to keep them.\r\n\r\nFollowing is a list of the names and activities of all the members of the \u201cLa Aurora\u201d group:\r\n\r\nFrancisca V\u00e1zquez. \u2013 Fast food sales\r\n\r\nMaria Guadalupe E.

The previous loans of 3,500 and 5,000 meticais were used to get a driver\u2019s license and those for 15,000 and 20,000 meticais were for construction work on his house.  He is confident that he will repay the loan before the set time and request another to build a fence.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":813741,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

If one does not end up farming, they will end up engaging in the other popular economic activities like raising goats and cattle \r\n\r\nA 35-year-old father of four, Patrick says for his case, he set forth in this business four years ago in Rukungiri.  Not so long, one may say, but he says he is already enjoying the experience of engaging in this business and he is already seeing better days on the horizon for his business. He has been basking in the glow of good business, principally after selling most of the crops he grows like bananas and cassava. The good spells he has enjoyed however, do not mean he has not bore witness to adversity. He says during some particular dry seasons, his business suffers bad harvests and consequently, he is not able to sell most of his harvests at good competitive market prices. This, at length, adversely affects his financial standing. Monthly, this business generates sales revenue to the tune of Ugandan shillings 150,000 and he says with this Kiva loan he is going to purchase hoes, pangas and high-grade manure to apply on his

Over time, she has built a cowshed.  However, it is now very necessary for her to improve the infrastructure of the cowshed, because she is coming up to the winter season, and this poses many difficulties if she is to keep the cowshed clean.  It is for this reason that she decided to look for financing options that will allow her to put her plans into practice, and so she decided to work with MFP as she saw it was a good option with repayments that were within her reach.  \r\n\r\nWith the money that she is receiving, she will buy sand and bags of cement.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Other members work in public transportation, welding, or as employees in public companies. The group members know how to get ahead in business so that they can give their families their daily bread.

That\u2019s Ma. Elena H., who, despite her physical imperfection, tries to help her husband and family improve their living conditions. She is 49 years old, married to Rogelio, who works as a sugarcane supervisor. She has two children aged 22 and 28 years old. The family lives in Hacienda Cosolacion, Silay City, Negros Occidental.\r\n\r\nTo help her family earn additional income, Ma. Elena invested in a pig fattening Business, which she managed with the help of her children. Because she wants to add more piglets to her business, she decided to join NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1998 to access more capital. The loans that she received since then have been used to buy additional piglets, feed, and vitamins for her pigs. Her loans helped to sustain her business and has enabled her to earn PHP 10,000 every time she sells her pigs, which takes 3-4 months to raise. She uses the income to support her children's needs and their household expenses. She is very happy that despite her situation she could earn an income and help her family.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 8,000 was utilized for her pig fattening business and the amount was fully paid on time without delay. Now she is borrowing PHP 9,000 for her 15th cycle loan to use to buy feed and vitamins for her pigs. Any profits will be used to defray family expenses.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":431016,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase adiitional feed and vitamins.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Silay, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-25T22:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

barrio ubicado en la sierra central peruana.\n\nDesde muy peque\u00f1o se ha dedicado a la agricultura, en la actualidad trabaja junto a sus padres en la siembra papa, alverja y habas. El trabajo de campo es pesado, ya que requiere de mucha  paciencia y dedicaci\u00f3n en el cuidado de cada una de las  plantas para que no les caiga plaga y lleguen bien hasta la cosecha.  Seg\u00fan sus palabras: \u201cen la agricultura se gana o se pierde, pero si se cuida bien el cultivo se llega a tener una buena producci\u00f3n\u201d. A Hernando le gusta mucho su trabajo, porque las ganancias de lo vendido le permiten vivir c\u00f3modamente. Lo que no le gusta es que muchas veces el precio de la papa baja, se compensa con la venta de las alverja y habas.\nY como es un joven muy emprendedor piensa en el futuro y para m\u00e1s adelante tiene planeado sembrar en mayor cantidad, sobretodo la alverja, ya que su precio se mantiene estable en el mercado nacional.\n\nEste es el tercer pr\u00e9stamo que tiene con MFP y est\u00e1 muy agradecido con todas las personas que hicieron posible el dinero que le permitir\u00e1 continuar trabajando. Adem\u00e1s est\u00e1 muy satisfecho con el trabajo que viene realizando su grupo comunal porque todos los integrantes son muy organizados y realizan mensualmente actividades que les permiten juntar para sus ahorros. \n\nHernando tiene pensado invertir el dinero solicitado en la compra de fertilizantes para asegurar sus plantaciones, tambi\u00e9n adquirir\u00e1 semilla de papa, alverja y habas para aumentar su producci\u00f3n.","en":"Hernando is 24 years old and lives in his own house together with his parents and siblings in a neighborhood located in the central Peruvian mountains.\r\n<p>\r\nSince he was very young he has been a farmer, presently he works with his parents planting potato, pea, and bean. Farming is hard work as it requires much patience and dedication with the care of each of the plants not to be affected by plague and reach harvest in good condition. According to his words: \"in farming you win or you lose, but if you care properly for your crop you will get a good production\". Hernando likes his job because the profit from his sales allows him to live comfortably. What he does not like is that many times the price of potato is low, but the sale of pea and bean makes up for the loss. \r\n<p>\r\nAnd as he is a very entrepreneurial young man he thinks about the future and it is his plan to plant even more, especially pea as the price is stable on the national market.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is his third loan with MFP and he is very grateful to all the people who made the money possible for him to continue his work. He is also very satisfied with the work done with his community group as all the members are very organized and work on a monthly basis to gather money for their savings.\r\n<p>\r\nHernando plans to invest the requested money in buying fertilizers to assure his crops.

S.] did not work and studied architecture on a casual basis.  It was then that he manufactured his first t-shirts and has been sewing garments ever since.   He started with a single sewing machine and gradually increased his number, as his sales increased, so that he could increase his efficiency and the quality of his products.  He now has 12 machines.\r\n\r\nAnd so began Jairo J. S.'s business.  He now sews alongside his wife, who was once a secretary, but now works exclusively in this business.  She does the measuring and hiring, and he primarily does the design work, cutting, printing, and sales.  His customers include prominent schools in the city of Barranquilla, for whom he makes sweaters, sweatshirts; and everything having to do with sports, which is his business' specialty.\r\n\r\nJairo, along with his wife's support, has managed to move his family ahead.  His family includes his three children, ages 15, 17, and 21.  He hopes that he will one day be able to see them all have professional careers.\r\n\r\nHe is requesting a loan in the amount of 1.355.500 COP ($725), through Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo because his son is going to begin studying to become a lawyer.  This will be his sixth loan though this organization and he feels that things have gone well, because he has managed to provide his children with a primary education.\r\n\r\nJairo tells us that the global economy has been a great setback to him, especially because of the Chinese merchandise that has entered the market.  Their t-shirts are very inexpensive, but the ones he and his family manufacture are of better quality.  Aside from Jario, his wife, and daughters, his mother and several employees also work in production.  He is constantly looking for strategies to keep all of his machines producing, creating work, earning money, and providing for his family's (and his own) well being.\r\n\r\nJario is a member of a loving family and is also a good artist who proudly displays his paintings on the walls of his home. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":567967,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Primary\/secondary school costs","sector":"Education","themes":null,"use":"Education","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-07-19T04:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jairo Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1355500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216685},{"due_date":"2010-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":220297},{"due_date":"2010-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":223968},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":227701},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":231496},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":235353}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.9},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.82},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.79},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":121.79},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.82},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":125.88}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":115.9,"local_amount":216685,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:17:11Z","rounded_local_amount":217061.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166850366},{"amount":117.82,"local_amount":220297,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:08:10Z","rounded_local_amount":220679.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172117120},{"amount":119.79,"local_amount":223968,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:01:15Z","rounded_local_amount":224356.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177410990},{"amount":121.79,"local_amount":227701,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:08:40Z","rounded_local_amount":228096.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550643},{"amount":123.82,"local_amount":231496,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":231897.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688248},{"amount":125.88,"local_amount":235353,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-18T09:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":235761.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427480}],"funded_date":"2010-07-19T08:12:31Z","paid_date":"2011-02-18T09:56:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from buying and selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap, canned goods, beverages, snack foods and toothpaste in the local community. She also sells green bananas. Anastacia has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Anastacia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Anastacia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 11,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional inventory and working capital. Anastacia is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell like snack foods and canned goods. This loan will be the 4th loan taken out by Anastacia from HSPFI.

She is 41 years old. Jovelyn is married and has five school-aged children. To make a living, Jovelyn owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting bananas for sale. Jovelyn has been engaged in her business for over one year and earns approximately 2000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Jovelyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jovelyn is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This will be the first loan taken out by Jovelyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

After finishing high school in 1983 Islatkan attended Osh Pedagogical Institute, but unfortunately after the first semester she was kidnapped for marriage (the ancient tradition of stealing girls for brides has lasted a long time but currently occurs rarely and is punishable by law). Since she had been married she had to quit college and became a house wife. In 1984 Islatkan gave birth to her daughter and in 1986 she divorced her husband and started to work as a nurse in the Zhalal-Abad hospital. In 1987 Islatkan found happiness in a second marriage and gave birth to a son and a daughter. Unfortunately in 2004 she divorced again and moved with her children to the city of Karabalt. To feed her family Islatkan opened a sewing business and has been making mattresses and pillows which she sells wholesale on the market. Because of her hard work and determination Islatkan's business has flourished in 2008 and she was able to buy an apartment in the Kalininskoe village. After her move Islatkan has married off all of her children, who now live with their own families.\r\n\r\nThe energetic Islatkan is still running her sewing business and takes in orders that yield 12,500 som (KGS) in monthly profits. To grow her business further she has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 70,000 som (KGS). She is planning to use the money to purchase a new sewing machine and a serger\/overlock machine. She is also planning to hire two seamstresses for her business which will allow her to take in more orders. In the future Islatkan dreams of opening a small sewing factory.\r\n

In the long term, she wants to be able to finish making improvements to her home and to be able to contribute to the balanced diet of the children at the dining-room so that they are healthy and strong. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Joanna Silverman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":215189,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"Expansion of a room","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-10-26T23:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luisa Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-10T02:18:38Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":19.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:56:35Z","rounded_local_amount":384.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9893367},{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:16:54Z","rounded_local_amount":384.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816444},{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:19:02Z","rounded_local_amount":384.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351151},{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":384.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038469},{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:39:46Z","rounded_local_amount":384.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35928772},{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-05-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:19:42Z","rounded_local_amount":384.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44383698},{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:24:29Z","rounded_local_amount":384.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890186},{"amount":19.44,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:33:07Z","rounded_local_amount":384.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111512},{"amount":19.48,"local_amount":333.36,"processed_date":"2009-08-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:41:00Z","rounded_local_amount":384.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73532952}],"funded_date":"2008-10-27T01:18:38Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T09:41:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Joanna Silverman","image":null}},{"id":74345,"name":"Patricia Evelyn","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

He studied until the 11th grade.  He is married and the father of 3 children:  the first is 8 years old, the second is 5, and the youngest is a new born of only 2 weeks.  The two oldest kids are students.\r\n\r\nHilario left V. for Beira with his parents who were in the miltary when he was only 2 years old.  He lived there for 15 years and was able to complete the 6th grade.  His father was transferred to work as a policeman in Namaacha, a town on the border of Swaziland, and he came with his family.  Arriving in Namaacha he was able to continue with his schooling and completed the 11th grade.  Since the cost of living was increasing every day Hilario borrowed money from his uncle and began his own business selling shoes in the informal market of Namaacha (known as Shoprite) that operates 2 times per week.\r\n\r\nHe was able to construct his own home.  Years later he was contracted to work in the Moseg as security of TDM in the same district.  Because of this he had to interrupt his business since his work schedule conflicted with the market days, and that caused him to go bankrupt.\r\n\r\nToday he is a worker for Moseg, and he earns monthly salary of 1,800MT working in shifts, one period of 24 hours per day 3 times per week.  He is unable to save any money because he earns so little.  In 2007 he found out about Hluvuku as soon as they opened a branch in Namaacha, and he had the opportunity to obtain a loan for 7,000MT.\r\n\r\nThis is Hilario's second loan through Hluvuku and his first with Kiva.  The first loan of 7,000MT was used to purchase shoes that he would resell at the informal market before work, and he is asking for this second loan of 10,000MT to purhase construction materials.  He is confident that he can repay this loan before its term so he can request another loan in order to construct a stand in his home to sell various staple products.\r\n\r\n<br

Comfort has been selling yams and bags of gari for almost eight years to support her family. She started this business with her mother when she was a young girl.

","en":"\r\n\r\n\tThis group is located in Tenextepango, A. municipality, state of Morelos. It\u2019s made of 4 members who are Mrs. Silvia N. C., whose works making hand-embroidered napkins and tablecloths, Mrs. Armanda R. A., who has a mechanic shop, and Mrs. Carmela A. V., who works selling cosmetics by catalog. Currently, they are in their third cycle. This group was formed on the recommendation from a member of another group.\r\n\r\n\tAt this time, we would like to call your attention to Mrs. Armanda R. A.. She is now 34 years old. Her family consists of her husband, her 8-year-old son, and she is presently 4 months pregnant. Mrs. Armanda has been part of this group since the first cycle. Currently, she has a loan of $5000, which she invested in valves, patches and calibrators, since her business is a mechanic shop, \u201cDiaz,\u201d that offers service in patching and sales of new and used tires.\r\n\r\nShe began her mechanic shop two and a half years ago, because she was working in a large tire shop in the city of Cuautla. Her bosses offered her a shop rental in the center of the market of Cuautla, so that she could establish her own business. When she told her husband, who was employed at the time, he agreed to open the shop, and they did. After some time, with the earnings from their first shop, they established another and, with government support, bought a tire press and balancer. Their second business was born, located in Tenextepango and tended by the brother-in-law of Mrs. Armanda, who has experience in two other mechanic shops. However, he says with pride that the customers prefer the service at this shop for its speed and efficiency, due to the fact that they use machines to do what other businesses do by hand, which takes more time. \r\n\r\nHer plans are to continue investing in their businesses, to get the investment for utilities needed for their home (floor, ironwork and exterior walls). The motivation that drives them is the desire to give their children a good home.\r\n\r\nIn the long-term, they want to offer alignment, however to give this service would require approximately $100,000 in capital. At this moment, they do not want to grossly indebt themselves with a loan this large. So they keep working until this loan is more realistic and give thanks for the trust that they have been offered through these loans. They say that they have served them well. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rebecca Towle, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":390144,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle Repairs","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase valves, patches and calibrators","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"TENEXTEPANGO, CD AYALA, MORELOS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Silvia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Armanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Adriana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":1363.05},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1391.81},{"due_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":1421.17},{"due_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1451.15},{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1481.76},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1513.02},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1544.94},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1577.53},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1610.81},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1644.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":102.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":104.38},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":106.59},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":108.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":111.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.48},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":115.87},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":118.31},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":120.81},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":123.36}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":206.61,"local_amount":2754.86,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:10:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2795.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96952647},{"amount":106.59,"local_amount":1421.17,"processed_date":"2009-10-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T22:12:45Z","rounded_local_amount":1442.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96952648},{"amount":108.84,"local_amount":1451.15,"processed_date":"2009-11-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:41:18Z","rounded_local_amount":1472.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103794803},{"amount":111.13,"local_amount":1481.76,"processed_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:41:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1503.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103794804},{"amount":113.48,"local_amount":1513.02,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:41:46Z","rounded_local_amount":1535.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103794805},{"amount":115.87,"local_amount":1544.94,"processed_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1567.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110685962},{"amount":118.31,"local_amount":1577.53,"processed_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:57:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1600.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110685963},{"amount":120.81,"local_amount":1610.81,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:48Z","rounded_local_amount":1634.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118080306},{"amount":123.36,"local_amount":1644.76,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1668.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118080307}],"funded_date":"2009-10-02T13:58:38Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T11:38:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rebecca Towle","image":225476}},{"id":144063,"name":"Mom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mom T., 45, is a widow who lives with one of her children in the Takeo province.

She has been in this business since the early 1990s. She started it after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when most government agricultural land was privatized. At the present time, her seasonal income from farming exceeds $1500 USD. Habibahon usually spends all her income in covering family expenses. Her business earnings have meant that her family could marry both children, build a house for her son, and increase the number of livestock. In the near future, Habibahon is planning to open a food market near her house. This is her first loan from Kiva partner, Mol Bulak Finance, and it will be used to buy potato seeds and 300 kilos of mineral fertilizers.\r\n<br>Hojiumar, 49, is a father of two married children. He is a farmer, and will use his loan to buy potato seeds and fertilizers. Hojiumar has a dream of building a pharmacy and barber shop in the village center because the local population has to go to the district center to buy drugs.  \r\n<br>Adinahon, 41, is also a farmer. Her family has a total of 0.47 hectare of land. She cultivates potatoes and wheat there. She is requesting a loan to prepare for the spring sowing by plowing and buying potato seeds. Adinahon is married with two children. Her husband works in a cotton plant, and all her family members take an active role in the family business. \r\n<br>Gaznahan is 47 years old. She is a widow with four children, the eldest two of whom are married. The other two children are students. Gaznahan will use her loan to buy 500 kilos of potato seeds and 100 kilos of fertilizer. In the future, Gaznahan hopes that she will be able to build a house for her second son. For her, the most important thing is the happiness of her children. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About Mol Bulak Finance<\/b><br>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.

coast province of Manab\u00ed. This fishing port is a major exporter of Tuna to different parts of the world since it was the first one dedicated to that type of fish. Narcisa is a native of Manta and is a responsible woman dedicated to her job. She is 54 years old and maintains a stable home with four children. Her eldest son is 30 years old. Narcisa works at a fish factory and aside from this also makes a living selling clothing by informally visiting clients at their homes. She brings in her merchandise from the city of Guayaquil at a low price, buying it at wholesale so she can obtain better profits. She gave us an example of how much she is benefiting from Kiva's help by being able to go and buy from the distributors because for every $12 she spends she doubles her profit with each pant she sells. She has to keep in mind the costs of the trip that she has to make in order to find good merchandise. With this new loan, she plans to invest in the purchase of clothes for Mother's Day since that month is a good one for sales. Narcisa's dream is to have a food stand selling ceviche (popular fish dish) and sandwiches.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":675,"image":{"id":534012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase pants and clothing for women","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-05-06T03:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":675,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Beata Narcisa De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":82.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.38},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709123},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:53Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892422},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:45Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632782},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":168.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846816}],"funded_date":"2010-05-16T00:23:11Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":202199,"name":"Lingueres Aynoumane 2 Group","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Le groupe Lingueres de Aynoumane 2 regroupe quatre (4) vendeurs de l\u00e9gumes et condiment d\u2019un march\u00e9 de quartier de la ville de Mbour.

Estrella grabbed that opportunity, and the loans she receives enable her to rent land which she can cultivate for farming rice, along with her husband and children. Their harvest is sold at the market or directly to a middle-man. The proceeds have improved their lifestyle.

At present, she is living with her grandchildren, who accompany her. Earlier, she worked in agriculture. She had banana farms, but their price in the market is very low and is not suitable for her. Because of this, 5 months ago she decided to open a restaurant, where she now has her own house. Every day she prepares food for her guests. What she likes about this business is that she is around people and, in this way, she doesn\u2019t feel alone. The most difficult thing has been waking up very early to begin preparing the food. The most inconvenient thing, sometimes, is having leftover food, which she then has to sell at an even lower price for the pigs. In her eagerness, she has put this restaurant before the failure of the farm. Malvina is an expert is gastronomy. Her regular customers include teachers, nurses, and some tourists.

district. She is 47 years old and a widow with three children. She completed a college education. She has always been a middle school teacher, but after her husband's death five years ago she started a business as well, selling rice at Gissar's Somon Market. In this season of the year rice prices rise, so she decided to apply for a loan to buy a reserve of rice. This will help her maintain prices until the new harvest so she doesn't lose customers. Her eldest son is also a middle school teacher.   <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Brown, Kiva

Evan\u2019s strong entrepreneurial spirit has motivated him to continue to look for ways that he can strengthen and expand his business.\r\n \r\nAs many small business owners know, securing a small loan in the US can be challenging and sometimes impossible, especially without collateral. Evan has tried, without success, to secure a loan from a number of banks who generally don\u2019t make such small loans.  He feels fortunate to have found an organization that understands the needs of small businesses. This is his second time coming to Opportunity Fund for a loan that he is confident will greatly help his business.\r\n  \r\nRecently, Evan earned his contractor\u2019s license and was able to secure the necessary insurance to enable him to provide start-to-finish services for home and business flooring needs. With the ability to do all types of floor installation and cleaning, Evan can build and maintain longer relationships with his clients and provide excellent service along the way.\r\n \r\nWith the loan, Evan hopes to increase the number of people he currently employs.

She is twenty-nine years old and married with one school-aged child. To make a living, Mary Grace owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. The main source of income for the business comes from planting and harvesting corn for sale. Mary Grace has been engaged in her business for over three years and earns approximately $42 a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Mary Grace joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation by engaging in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000.00 PHP from PMPC. This loan was used to  purchase fertilizers such as manure. Mary Grace is requesting a new loan of 12000 PHP which will be used for the same purpose. This will be her third loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the loan to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative: PMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

(Melon soup). The demands for dried fish are high in Nigeria. \r\n\r\nBeauty sells dried fish to make a living in Sapele. She loves this business because of the one-on-one interaction that she has with her customers. She sells her dried fish in the market.

She is also engaged in fish selling.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Celestina joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,900 PHP from PMPC which was used as additional capital for raising pigs. Celestina is requesting a new loan of 14,900 PHP which will be used as additional capital for fish selling. This will be the 17th loan she has taken out from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to her standard of living. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in north-western Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

SELFINA has taken a leading role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions as they lack tangible collateral assets. This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Where a client needs working capital SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extending a loan to her, then leasing back the same equipment\u2014a process called a sale and leaseback

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.<P>\r\n\r\n One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":205167,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stocks of shoes and hand bags","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-09-20T17:30:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mwanvua","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-04T19:00:44Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":300000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":30000},{"due_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":30000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-11-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T04:20:07Z","rounded_local_amount":31779,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5348028},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2008-12-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:06:22Z","rounded_local_amount":31779,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970611},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:12:08Z","rounded_local_amount":31779,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886828},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":31779,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436088},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:53:38Z","rounded_local_amount":31779,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130361},{"amount":27.49,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-04-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:22:28Z","rounded_local_amount":31779,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027178},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:12:16Z","rounded_local_amount":31779,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613218},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:00:10Z","rounded_local_amount":31779,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010301},{"amount":27.51,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:18Z","rounded_local_amount":31779,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232612},{"amount":27.5,"local_amount":30000,"processed_date":"2009-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:13Z","rounded_local_amount":31779,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664428}],"funded_date":"2008-09-20T19:00:44Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":70281,"name":"Maria Elena","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Elena tiene 30 a\u00f1os de edad, es casada y habita en el barrio Laureles Sur, tiene tres hijos de 1,5 y 8 a\u00f1os de edad, su esposo trabaja en servicios de seguridad y aporta a los gastos del hogar.

Zulola is 20-years old. She is not married and lives with her parents. Zulola is a market vendor who sells fabrics for national dresses in the local market. Zulola started this business because she needed money to be able to support her parents and to pay for household and personal expenses. Zulola has been in this business for 2 years. For these years she managed to make her business stable and profitable so that she can generate the income she needs for her family. Now Zulola is planning to expand her business and is requesting a loan of $800. This will enable her to have a wide assortment of fabrics. She promises to repay the loan promptly and thanks all those supporting her. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her business is located at Juja, a business market in Thika. Thika is the region in Kenya known for production of pineapples. \r\n<p>\r\nMaryanne says that this business is profitable and the only major challenge she has is that there are very many people in the area doing the same kind of business as hers, hence customers are spoilt for choice. However, she works very hard to keep her business doing well. \r\n<p>\r\nShe will use her loan of 50000 KES to increase her float to enable her serve more people. In the future, she hopes to open more M-PESA outlets to serve a larger market and become the market leader in this kind of business. She is a very hardworking and innovative

He lives in his own home with his wife Flaviana, age 45, and their five beloved children for whom he wants to provide the best education.  As a boy, his parents taught him everything about farming and as time passed he was given the responsibility to take charge of their land when his older brother decided to pursue other activities.  Victor now has vast plots of farmland where he grows peas and potatoes, which are later sold at the wholesale market in Tarma.  What he enjoys most about his job is cultivating the land since the work helps to feed his family.  Victor has been in business for 20 years and considers the most difficult part to be protecting his crops from plagues of insects that impact his production.  His greatest wish is to buy a vehicle so that he can easily transport his harvest into the city.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is his sixth loan with MFP.  Victor has always been punctual with his payments and hopes to continue to do the same with this loan.  In his Communal Bank, he is one of the members who gets along well with the rest of the group.  With the loan of 2000 PEN that he requested, Victor will buy seeds for planting peas since it is the crop that currently sells the best.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":543364,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase seeds for planting his next crop of peas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-05-22T15:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Victor ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-09T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:33Z","rounded_local_amount":2062.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326724}],"funded_date":"2010-05-22T19:27:21Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":206327,"name":"Clarita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Clarita V. owns and operates a general store selling a variety of different products in her community.

Unfortunately, in 1964, when Ainagul was one year old, her parents died in a car accident and Ainagul grew up at her grandmother\u2019s house, helping her in the household: she milked cows and pastured the cattle.\n\nFrom her childhood, Ainagul was eager to study and, after graduating from secondary school, she intended to pursue her studies through higher education. However, when Ainagul was 23, she was given into marriage.\n\nAinagul and her husband moved to the capital, Bishkek, where she graduated from Bishkek Humanities University with a degree with honors. Ainagul and her husband returned to the south of the country where Ainagul got a job as a researcher at Osh State University. In 1996, Ainagul divorced her husband. Some years later, Ainagul, being a very whole-hearted and persistent woman, adopted two little girls, who are presently 8 and 11 years old.\n\nIn 2004, Ainagul and her daughters moved to Belovodskoe village near the capital. It was the beginning of a new life which led Ainagul to start up her business. With an investment of only 6,000 Kyrgyz Soms, Ainagul started to sell foodstuffs at a local market in 2006. After four years, she already owns her own little shop.  Recently, she also bought two milk cows and began cattle-breeding.\n\nAinagul will use this loan of 100,000 Kyrgyz Soms to further broaden the range of the food products in her shop and to buy one more cow. With the revenues, she plans to renovate her shop and to give a good education to her daughters. As for Ainagul, she intends to get a driving license this year.\n\n\nAbout Bai-Tushum and Partners:\nBai-Tushum and Partners uses Kiva funding to target the especially vulnerable members of the population.

Only two of her five children, ages 10 and 15, live with them.\r\n\r\nBertha is an example of work and sacrifice.  As an anecdote, she tells us that one time they erroneously arrested one of her sons who works as a taxi drive.  This fact is very painful for her to remember because it marked their lives.\r\n\r\nFor the last five years Bertha has been selling cosmetics in offices and homes in the canton.  Bertha only has an elementary school education.  Upon seeing the need to financially support her household, she started selling cosmetics for a multilevel company.\r\n\r\nShe is a tenacious woman who puts forth effort every day in order to get her household ahead.  Her big dream is to see her children become professionals.  Then, she wants to repair her house.  \r\n\r\nShe currently receives help from one of her daughters who works as a secretary.  This daughter sells her mother\u2019s products to her colleagues at work.  Bertha works eight hours a day.  She tells us that the most difficult part of her business activity is charging.  She gives many of her customers credit because of the existing competition.\r\n\r\nBertha requested a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Alternativa.

puestos de trabajo a personas que quedaron sin ellos tras el sismo de 8.0 grados en el a\u00f1o 2007.  \n\nJaime se dedica a trabajar todo el tiempo para que junto a los ingresos que obtiene su esposa como empleada del hogar puedan ganar el dinero que se necesita para poder  cuidar y alimentar a sus 2 ni\u00f1os, uno de sus menores tiene 3 a\u00f1os y ya se encuentra cursando el nivel inicial, mientras que el mayor  de 8 a\u00f1os se encuentra en el nivel primario, ambos acuden diariamente a la escuela.\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nEl se\u00f1or Jaime es maestro constructor, \u00e9l se ha dedico a esta

Ica has had an increase in investments, not only in agricultural exports but also in the opening of new commercial centers that offer work to people who have been unemployed since the 2007 8.0 earthquake. \r\nJaime works full time to put earnings together along with those of his wife, a domestic, so that they can have the money needed to care for and feed their two children.  One of the children is 3 and he is already in pre-school, while the older is 8 and in the first grade.  They both attend school every day.\r\n\r\nJaime has been a master construction worker for the past 8 years and works an average of 8 hours a day.  Thanks to his father and the motivation that he has, he can perform this work since his father started teaching him all he needed to know from the time he was very young.  Jaime can only take care of one customer a day because of the amount of work that he is asked to do, and this lets him earn about 60 sols per day.  Sometimes when he is very lucky and has many jobs, he can earn up to 100 sols.  This allows him to pay some of the expenses that he has.  \r\n\r\nHis small business is successful because of the great number of people who need construction jobs done, since these are very complicated to do.  Now he wants the loans from Kiva to help him have medical treatment on his knee because he had an accident and it\u2019s hard for him to work.  He also wants to buy some furniture for his children and he would like to be able to pay off the financing in 12 months.\r\nHe thinks that this loan will help him improve his agility in his work, because now it takes him longer than normal since he is constantly moving his injured knee.  The furniture that he will buy will be more comfortable for his children and since he expects to be totally recuperated in a few months, he wants to begin improving his house.  The loan will help him fulfill his dream of finishing building and helping his children become professionals in the future.\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":944539,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Construction","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"to have medical treatment on his knee and to buy furniture for his children","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2011-12-13T23:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaime Adalberto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":96.46},{"due_date":"2012-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":105.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":112.3},{"due_date":"2012-04-08T07:00:00Z","amount":113.29},{"due_date":"2012-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":118.73},{"due_date":"2012-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":121.79},{"due_date":"2012-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":127.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":130.91},{"due_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":135.7},{"due_date":"2012-10-08T07:00:00Z","amount":141.2},{"due_date":"2012-11-08T08:00:00Z","amount":145.84},{"due_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","amount":151.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.98},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.37},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.05},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.43},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.51},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.69},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.78},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.18},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.02},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.12},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.91},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.96}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":36.98,"local_amount":96.46,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:46:04Z","rounded_local_amount":99.84,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257142508},{"amount":40.37,"local_amount":105.33,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:58:06Z","rounded_local_amount":109.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271096},{"amount":43.05,"local_amount":112.3,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:45:24Z","rounded_local_amount":116.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269993750},{"amount":88.94,"local_amount":232.02,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:34:08Z","rounded_local_amount":240.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283090788},{"amount":95.47,"local_amount":249.04,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T09:08:31Z","rounded_local_amount":257.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294297965},{"amount":50.18,"local_amount":130.91,"processed_date":"2012-08-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T09:24:10Z","rounded_local_amount":135.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301350757},{"amount":52.02,"local_amount":135.7,"processed_date":"2012-09-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-15T09:22:50Z","rounded_local_amount":140.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308108398},{"amount":167.99,"local_amount":438.24,"processed_date":"2012-12-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-15T12:23:04Z","rounded_local_amount":453.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":331088242}],"funded_date":"2011-12-26T23:49:42Z","paid_date":"2013-01-15T12:23:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Miriam Palacio","image":693116}},{"id":374369,"name":"Sila","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sila lives in Changamwe, Kenya.

This leads to poor financial support, hence poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women.
