The family's primary source of income is selling fish, a business that Victoria started from her loan with ASHI.  \r\n\r\nShe is applying for another loan of PHP 20,000 for additional capital to buy fish from small fishermen in the community. She sells these fish in nearby municipal markets and cities. She wants to improve her business to make it more stable. By doing this, she knows that she can create jobs and help the fishermen she buys from to improve their own standards of living. She is thankful that ASHI and Kiva give her the opportunity to have access to capital and to improve her family's quality of life.

La labor que realiza Jorge es labrar la tierra, donde tiene plantaciones de cacao y caf\u00e9. Sus padres le ense\u00f1aron a remover la tierra y gracias a ello, hoy trabaja en sus propias tierras. Es conocedor del arduo trabajo en el campo, donde lleva trabajando 10 a\u00f1os. En los d\u00edas  de cosecha cuenta con el apoyo de los jornaleros quienes se encargan de trasladar los productos cosechados hasta cierto tramo; para luego poder comercializarlo. Se siente muy comprometido con su trabajo; porque  gracias a su esfuerzo cotidiano hoy disfruta al ver que sus plantas est\u00e1n desarrollando, as\u00ed obteniendo buenas ganancias; nos comenta adem\u00e1s que la estaci\u00f3n de invierno no es de su agrado porque en estos meses abundan los insectos y las lluvias son constantes as\u00ed imposibilitando el rendimiento en su trabajo.

He cohabits with Zelmira, 24, and they have two children, Yasmin, 5, and Kelvin, 1.  They all live together in their own house in the community of Santa Rosa, an annex of Anco district.\r\n\r\nJorge works as a farmer; he has cocoa bean and coffee crops.  His parents taught him how to till the land and thanks to that today he has his own fields.  He is well aware of how hard field work is; he\u2019s been doing it for 10 years.  During harvest time he hires day laborers who transport the harvested products a certain distance to be sold.  He is very committed to his job because thanks to his daily efforts today he enjoys watching his plants develop thus earning good profits.  He also tells us that he doesn\u2019t much enjoy the winter season because insects are plentiful and rain is constant making productive work impossible.  In time, he\u2019d like to buy more land and vary his crops to provide his family with a good economic stability.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP and he feels it will help his business\u2019 progress a lot and is willing to repay in a timely fashion.  He thanks Prisma for granting the loan.  He will use the requested 2000 new soles to buy cocoa bean and citrus seeds.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":717313,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":" To buy cocoa bean and citrus seeds.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-02-21T22:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jorge ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-18T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":175.46},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":174.69},{"due_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":182.98},{"due_date":"2011-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":187.64},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":195.95},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":201.52},{"due_date":"2011-09-19T07:00:00Z","amount":207.76},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":217.93},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":224.22},{"due_date":"2011-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":231.85}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.6},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.33},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.02},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.03},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.05},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.32},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.99},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.28},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":84.05}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":65.19,"local_amount":179.83,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:58Z","rounded_local_amount":180.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327759},{"amount":62.7,"local_amount":172.97,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:31:54Z","rounded_local_amount":173.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196281},{"amount":65.37,"local_amount":180.33,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:42:06Z","rounded_local_amount":180.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269962},{"amount":70.94,"local_amount":195.71,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:39Z","rounded_local_amount":196.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549976},{"amount":71.23,"local_amount":196.51,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":196.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718655},{"amount":72.34,"local_amount":199.55,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:13:49Z","rounded_local_amount":199.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350076},{"amount":74.37,"local_amount":205.16,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:07Z","rounded_local_amount":205.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850628},{"amount":79.15,"local_amount":218.35,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:55:51Z","rounded_local_amount":218.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238665855},{"amount":163.71,"local_amount":451.59,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:29Z","rounded_local_amount":452.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244621027}],"funded_date":"2011-02-22T02:41:23Z","paid_date":"2011-12-15T10:42:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":279712,"name":"Hannah Wanjiru","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hannah has practised farming in Nduyu, Njeru town for the last 18 years.

This is Tatu C.. She is 38 years old, married, and has four children between the ages of 4 and 22 years old. In 2005, Tatu established her general store business. Working six days a week, and 9 to 12 hours per day, she earns about $170 each month from this business. She is assisted by her husband. Tatu has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and now seeks a new loan in order to purchase additional stock in bulk. In the future, Tatu plans to increase the quantity and range of her stock. She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. <P>."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":140702,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stock in bulk.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-18T23:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-02T05:06:44Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80000},{"due_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":70}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-05-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:32:28Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":199170},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-06-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:34:47Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226061},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-07-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:00Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":255396},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-08-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:02Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":284139},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-09-02T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-18T07:23:02Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":314316},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-10-02T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-12T07:17:38Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":345747},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:20:30Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347576},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:10Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970196},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-01-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886446},{"amount":70,"local_amount":80000,"processed_date":"2009-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:59:57Z","rounded_local_amount":82635,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435732}],"funded_date":"2008-03-19T05:06:44Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T20:59:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":45329,"name":"Jesus Del Pilar","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"<p>Jesus belongs to the community bank Mujeres Creativas 2, located at Jr. Tiwinsa Mz.

She owns a house, which is made of adobe. She strives to give her children a better life and spends her days weaving elastic head bands, scarves, gloves, etc. She enjoys knitting and makes it very skillfully. She sells her products in a small booth that is located at the Explanada Laguna Temporal(where fairs are held in the city of Juliaca) and they are sold very quickly. \r\n<p>\r\nShe hopes to have a shop in the future where she can provide greater convenience to her customers and increase her income. Although she has 5 years of experience in this activity, it is still difficult to make the finished garments. With all the efforts that she makes, she hopes to give her children a good education and for them to be good professionals and useful to society. This is Aida\u2019s first loan with MFP and she is saving to pay her dues on time, as not to cause problems for members of her community bank, where she feels very happy. With the $175 that she is asking for, she is planning to buy more wool to increase her production\r\n\r\n.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Adriana Pierce, Kiva

He is a cattleman, who raises cattle to sell. At the same time, Narimon sells dried fruits in the local market. Narimon has been working as a market vendor for 3 years. Thanks to these two businesses, Narimon is able to support his parents with their household expenses. Today, Narimon is going to increase the turnover capital for his business selling dried fruits. With this purpose in mind, he is requesting $3000 US Dollars. The loan will be spent on purchasing dried fruits and cattle for selling. This is the first loan for Narimon, however, he is sure he shall be able to pay it in time and thanks everyone who trusts him with their support. \r\n \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is married and has three adult children.  To make a living, Qu\u00fd owns and operates a business venture in the food sector \u2013 operating a butcher shop. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from butchering and selling a variety of meats in the local community. Qu\u00fd has been engaged in this business for over 12 years and earns approximately 4,200,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Qu\u00fd joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Qu\u00fd has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,392,000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. Qu\u00fd is now requesting a new loan of 8,288,000 VND which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. The loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Qu\u00fd from SEDA. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Viet Nam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is married and has no children, but has four dependents, who live with him to be fostered.  \r\n\r\nIn 2004, Sulaiman established a business; he sells soft drinks, tinned milk, sardines, luncheon meat, sugar, bread, batteries, eggs, etc. He began his business because his parents did not provide any formal education for him. He started selling liquor with a very small amount of money; the profit he accumulated was used to join his elder brother's used-clothing business. Later he used his profit to start his own business selling watches and transformed that into a grocery shop. Working seven days a week, 18 hours a day, he earns about 3,148,000 SLL every month from this business. \r\n\r\nHe would like a loan in the amount of 3,000,000 SLL. Sulaiman requires this loan to buy the following items: cartons of sardines, luncheon meat, batteries, Ovaltine, milk, bread, eggs, and bags of gari and sugar.

He is Acholi and is one of the many thousands of people who were forced to flee their homes in the North because of the war that has been going on for the last 20 years.  His family lives in an Internally Displaced People's camp in the outskirts of Kampala called the Acholi Quarter. Six months ago J. joined Life in Africa and has been an active member ever since.  He started as a bracelet maker in the Invisible Children Bracelet Project but his hard work and determination quickly earned him a promotion to a sanding processor. <br><br>\r\n\r\nHe has acquired a piece of land from the King of Buganda who has sympathy for the people of Acholi and who has set aside free land for them.  Knowing that the people of the Acholi quarter have to go long distances to look for water, he has a plan to install a water tap on his land. The current water sellers who bring water in to this hilltop area are charging five shillings per litre for water which makes it very hard for the people to purchase water for their needs.  With a water tap installed on his land, J. will be able to purchase water for only one shilling per litre and he plans on selling this water for a reduced rate of  3 shillings per litre to his community.  <br><br>\r\n\r\nNot only will this provide a steady income for his family needs, but it will also offer a valuable service to his community at a more affordable price than they can currently get. This will insure that he has a secure source of buyers for his water, and it is likely to have a great impact on those living in the Acholi quarters.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this project, J. is seeking a loan in the amount of shs. 800,000 ($475).  He es-timates that once he acquires this loan it will take approximately one week to have the water tap installed.  Below is his budget:<br><br>\r\n\r\n16 metal pipes @ 12000= each =192000=<br>\r\nconnection fee to national water=300000=<br>\r\nlabor charges & other expenses =200000=<br>\r\nbuilding of small house so that the tap can be locked to avoid theft =100000=<br>\r\nThe whole total is 792000=.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBased on his current income, J. will be able to repay this loan in 12 months.

This is Nasma N.. She is 30 years old, married, and has three children between the ages of 5 and 19 years old. In addition, she has two dependents living with her because their parents cannot afford to care for them. In 2006, Nasma established her clothing and cosmetics business. Working seven days a week, and 9 to 12 hours a day, she earns about $100 each month from her business. She is assisted by her sister and one employee. Nasma has already received and successfully repaid one loan from SELFINA, and now seeks a new loan in order to purchase additional stocks of clothes, shoes, and cosmetics. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profit by approximately $45. In the future, Nasma plans to diversify her business. She thanks you for your support. <P>SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. <P> Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. <P>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":140723,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To expand and improve her business by purchasing additional clothing, shoes, and cosmetics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Dar es Salaam","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-6.8 39.283333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-03-19T18:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nasma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-04-03T20:57:51Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":60000},{"due_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":60000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":52.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53,"local_amount":60571.43,"processed_date":"2008-05-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:32:30Z","rounded_local_amount":62566.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":200098},{"amount":53,"local_amount":60571.43,"processed_date":"2008-06-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:34:57Z","rounded_local_amount":62566.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227092},{"amount":53,"local_amount":60571.43,"processed_date":"2008-07-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:38:02Z","rounded_local_amount":62566.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":256332},{"amount":53,"local_amount":60571.43,"processed_date":"2008-08-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T00:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":62566.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":285073},{"amount":53,"local_amount":60571.43,"processed_date":"2008-09-03T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-19T07:16:47Z","rounded_local_amount":62566.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":315266},{"amount":53,"local_amount":60571.43,"processed_date":"2008-10-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-10-13T07:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":62566.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":346839},{"amount":49.5,"local_amount":56571.42,"processed_date":"2008-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T03:21:41Z","rounded_local_amount":58434.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5347582},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2008-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:05:53Z","rounded_local_amount":61976.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9970202},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-01-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:11:25Z","rounded_local_amount":61976.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14886452},{"amount":52.5,"local_amount":60000,"processed_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:31Z","rounded_local_amount":61976.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20435737}],"funded_date":"2008-03-20T20:57:51Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T21:00:31Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":45345,"name":"Maria Luisa","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Luisa belongs to the Banco Comunal La Familia group, located in Jr Urubamba 798, in the district of Calleria, in the county of Ucayali.

She is married and has three children. Her family lives in Kanibadam, Northern Tajikistan. Rahima sells clothes for children in the central city market. The location of her vending store is very favorable as it\u2019s in a busy place. Rahima has been in this trade for many years. She has proven to be an honest and communicative businesswoman. Rahima is hoping to make a loan of $ 1200 USD to increase the variety of inventory in her store and keep her business running successfully. She promises to fulfill the loan term within 9 months. This purchase will enable her to increase her sales, to earn more, and to meet the education expenses of her children.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n<P>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

So the three children became two: Marites, now 25 years old and working as a sales lady, and Joshua, now 16 years old, and currently studying.\r\n\r\nThe main source of their income is through their variety store business that Josephine has run for ten years now. When she joined Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), she always used the loans that she received in her variety store business to make it grow. And now with her 8th loan she will use the loan again for improving her business. She will buy necessary things for her business to make it more productive.\r\n\r\nAs a member of ASHI for four years now, Josephine has been a good member. She is always present at center meetings and always on time in paying her responsibilities. That is why Josephine is really sure that she can make their life a better one because of her effort and with the help of ASHI.\r\n\r\nOne of Josephine\u2019s dreams is that her youngest son finish his studies because she knows that education is one of the keys to success. She really loves her children, so she always wants the best for them every day of their life. She doesn\u2019t want to experience again losing a child; it really broke her heart so

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting bananas for sale.  Gaumati has 3 years of experience in this business.  Gaumati needs a loan of WST $750 to purchase harvesting equipment such as wheelbarrows, shovels, rakes, baskets, and knives.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 145 tala or US $60 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Gaumati joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Gaumati's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Gaumati F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2.63 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.87 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She lives in Brgy 2, Sipalay City Negros Occidental with her husband, Nonito, who helps her in running the business, and their only child, who is of school age.\r\n\r\nShe has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2000, and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her dressmaking and gown-for-rent business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 13,000.\r\n\r\nMa.

Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Ma.

She decided to invest in a moto-car to use as a taxi with the first loan of 300 soles ($125) that she received from Manuela Ramos.  Currently a driver drives the moto-car, but she administers all the income and expenses for the vehicle, although when it comes to mechanical things she does not understand.  Despite this, she benefits from the vehicle and is thinking about buying another similar vehicle.  With this loan of 1,200 soles ($425), which she will repay over 5 months, she will maintain the vehicle, as it needs some spare parts.  Neria is happy with Manuela Ramos because it gave her the opportunity to buy her moto-car and manage it well, and her husband values his wife\u2019s initiative.  He has suggested that he be the driver and she be the administrator.

Due to the lack of jobs in his town, Dushanbe, Tajikistan, to provide for his family Amriddin started his own business selling sewing machines and supplies (needle, thread, and other small items) about 14 years ago. He has become well-known in his town, and his sales have increased. To continue growing his business, Amriddin is requesting a loan in the amount of $1300 to purchase more merchandise to offer customers greater variety and quality of products and to provide better customer service.

He and his family thank you very much! \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; its role in ending Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous cultural figures, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi, and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC.  Even today, Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, modern Western culture, and Central Asian traditions. Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  A civil war that began soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged Tajikistan's already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition to potential lenders. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self-esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n *Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He is 45 years old, married and a father of three children between the ages 16 and 22, two of them students. He finished 7th grade but had to drop school to start working and help his parents. He lives with his wife, children and stepdaughter at their house in the district of Boane. \r\n\r\nHe left Inhambane for Maputo in 1981 and lived with his uncle and aunt, trying to find better life conditions. Soon after that he got a job and got married in 1992. He's been working as a typist for over 23 years, and makes 2.895,00 (about U$105) per month. With this money he supports his family, builds his house and pays loans. \r\n\r\nThis is Rom\u00e3o's third loan, in the amount of $375, which he'll use to buy construction supplies. His first loans were for the same purpose, in the amounts of $110 and $220. He's committed to pay this loan like he's paid the ones in the past. He dreams of seeing his house finished.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Mariana Dauwe, Kiva

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting breadfruit for sale.  Lagomau  has 6 years of experience in this business.  Lagomau  needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase general farm supplies & equipment.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 162 tala or US $68 per week) to make improvements to her house.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Lagomau  joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Lagomau 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Lagomau  N. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.2 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.87 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.56 out of 3\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He is 37 years old, and a single father of two children who are 12 and 3 years old. The eldest attends school. Fernando only completed the first grade, and didn't continue due to lack of resources and the negligence of his parents. He lives with his children in his own home, and also supports a brother who lives with him. \r\n\r\nHe left Maputo with his mother after she left his father, and they relocated their residence to Boane. He currently lives in this district and has owned his own shop for over 17 years. He works from 7 am until 9 pm, and mainly sells beer and soft drinks. He has no employees. \r\n\r\nHe earns around 1000 MZN a day, and uses the money for household expenses and saves some through a Xitique (a traditional savings system). He's never taken out a loan with other banks, and learned about Hluvuku through his friend Mr. Antonio Mundlovu who is also a client of the organization. This is his fourth loan, and is in the amount of 17000 MZN. He plans to use the money to purchase products (beer, wine, soft drinks and others) to increase the quality of the merchandise in his establishment. The earlier loans were for 8000 MZN, 12000 MZN and 15000 MZN, and were all used for the same purpose. \r\n\r\nIn the future, he hopes to apply for additional loans to increase the size of his commercial establishment and provide better service to his customers. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by David Kaisel, Kiva

In sales she does very well and has fifteen years with this business, initially she sold on credit but didn't make a profit and now her sales are only in cash and because of this she makes a better profit. Rosa is very happy with her business, because it generates good profits and what calls attention to her business is that she has friends and acquaintances who she talks with and is entertained by. From now on she plans to rent a stall in the market and she wishes to avoid the constant risk of transporting her merchandise. This is her thrity-second loan with MFP and she agrees to the commitment to continue making payments punctually.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Hamtic is situated to the south of Antique, and is bounded by mountains in one direction and the coast in the other.  Evelyn is 38 years old and has two sons and two daughters.  Her eldest child, a daughter, is 14 and attends high school; the other three children are still in primary school.  Evelyn's husband Alexius is a driver.\r\n<P>\r\nEvelyn plans to use the money from this loan to buy inventory for her sari-sari store.  \"Sari-sari\" is Tagalog for \"various kinds\" and the shops sell just that: an assortment of basic foodstuffs, beverages, and everyday commodities. The shops retail items in small units -- selling single cigarettes, for example. Sari-sari shops fill an important economic and social niche in Filipino life, especially in poor or rural areas; they often have chairs or a bench out front and act as neighborhood watering holes.\r\n<P>\r\nEvelyn dreams that one day perhaps she'll be able to grow her sari-sari store into a mini-mart.

She lives with her husband, a jeepney driver and mechanic, and their three school-aged children. Sittinona's family is also one of the earliest recipients of a row-house unit in the Habitat for Humanity Housing Project, in BASECO Compound, Port Area, Manila.\n\nSittinona started a small general store in 2003. When she joined CCT in 2005, she was able to keep her store going and growing. The store, located at the heart of the Habitat and near the school, caters to customers from all over. Sittinona took advantage of its location near the school by adding school supplies to satisfy the high demand from elementary students at a nearby school. Sittinona will use this loan to expand the inventory in her store.\n\nJust last year, Sittinona received another heaven-sent blessing \u2013 she and her husband were able to buy a passenger jeepney, which her husband drives every day. They use their combined income from the store and the jeepney's daily income to support the education of their three children.

Narantsetseg started her business in 1995 with her capital of 300,000 tugrugs. She has gained much selling experience and knowledge of her trade over the years, and attributes her success to her good accounting skills. Today, her working capital exceeds 700,000 tugrugs. In the future, she hopes to grow her business and move out of her shipping container, which is a very uncomfortable workplace. She says, \"I hope to own a stall in the trading center where I can work comfortably.\" She also plans to use her future earnings to remodel her house.

She came to know about Hluvuku through her cousin who is also a member. This loan, in the amount of 25.000.00mt, is her third. She intends to building materials (screens, beams, cement and others) to continue building her house. The previous loans were for 6.000.00mt and15.000.00mt and were used for the same purpose. \r\n\r\nShe makes a commitment to pay this loan on time, to be able to be granted further credit.

She raises and sells birds, like chickens, ducks, and other types of fowl.  She also sells breakfast at the market in the morning.  She prepares humitas (flavored corn paste wrapped in corn leaves) and tamales when they are requested.  She works very hard because she would like to invest in her children's occupation.  \r\n\r\nSebastiana has raised and sold pigs for many years with her small income.

They will use the money to pay loan interest and day-to-day family expenses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Michael Briggs, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":567464,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy fertilizer, seed and small tools","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"N'Tion","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bintou  ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adjaratou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Badina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":220000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":220000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":425}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":425,"local_amount":220000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:45Z","rounded_local_amount":221294.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917830}],"funded_date":"2010-08-04T19:26:52Z","paid_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:45Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michael Briggs","image":983838}},{"id":218309,"name":"Aidah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Aidah is married with five children and all of them are at school.

He works hard in both jobs to be able to meet the family's financial needs. \r\n\r\nToday, he is requesting to borrow $1000 from Kiva partner Ameen s.a.l so he can buy a car.

She believes that her entrepreneurial skills, land, good climate and a constant desire to learn something new will push the level of the business upward. The only thing she lacks is financial capital. For this reason she gathered a group of ambitious private entrepreneurs like her and applied for a loan from Kiva, cooperating with its field partner in Kyrgyzstan Mol Bulak Finance. \r\n\r\nNazira will start with the purchase of 500 kg of potato seeds. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused Microfinance Institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\n\r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Now he is working hard to be able to offer his wife a better quality of life and to have a quiet retirement.  Segundo's work is repairing and maintaining air conditioners.  He generally works with a few public and private institutions, but when he's not working he's usually at home fixing things.  He's always waiting for his cell or home phone to ring because when it does it's because a customer needs him to go to his house or office to repair an air system.  He has been in this business for 31 years, during which he has gained experience and improved his technique.  He likes his work a lot because it allows him to have free time to spend at home and it also makes him good money because in his area the heat is intense and there are a lot of air conditioning systems, which mean a big market for him.  He is currently at the stage where he is expanding his business, as he wants to not only do repairs, but also to sell replacement parts for these products.  This will be his sixth loan with MFP and he is very happy to know that he will have the financial support to increase his working capital.

All of her businesses help to meet their daily expenses, but she is requesting a new loan to buy additional goods for her variety store as well as rice for resale.\r\n\r\nIsabel's hope is that her

The way she treats her customers is the best and all her neighbors buy from her. \r\n\r\nWith this loan she wants to supply more merchandise such as eggs, milk, cream, bread, refreshments, Sabritas, canned chiles, sugar, etc.  Her goal for the future is to be able to give a better quality of life to her children and continue supporting them in their studies. \r\nMs. Amalia tells us that she likes her group because they support her and she likes the idea of working with FRAC and Kiva and because the interest is very low.

Beatriz makes a living selling dairy products. She has six heads of cattle to produce the milk, which she sells in order to help the household income. Her husband makes a living in agriculture, harvesting carrots, onion and potatoes, which Beatriz then sells in the town of Santiva\u00f1ez, 20 minutes outside of Londo and an hour from the city of Cochabamba.

While they have found professionals to help their son, they cannot pay for the treatment, which is why they have requested a loan so they increase their income and cover the expenses. Beatrix plans to use the loan to purchase another head of cattle to increase her income. In this way she can pay off the specialists who are helping her young son.

Ella ha tenido su negocio por alrededor de 1 a\u00f1os, el cual inici\u00f3 con un peque\u00f1o capital que fue ahorrando mientras realizaba otros tipo de negocio. Kenia est\u00e1 planificando invertir su nuevo pr\u00e9stamo en la compra de Sacos de Arroz, azucar, harina, habichuelas, entre otros alimentos. Ella va a utilizar sus ganancias para reinvertir en su negocio, le gusta leer y su reto mas dificil ha sido estudiar. Su m\u00e1s grande sue\u00f1o es poder convertirse en una profesional.","en":"Kenia operates one of our small businesses.  She has a store--called a \"colmado\" in the Dominican Republic--where she sells the common food items that her customers need to make their daily meals.  It's a small store in the city of San Pedro de Macoris where she lives.  The city is famous for its sugar industry and the soccer balls that are made here.  The economy depends on a free trade zone, the cement industry and other activities such as tourism.  Kenia came to us because she needed to invest in her business.\r\n\r\nKenia is really excited to receive this, her fifth Esperanza Internacional loan, after having successfully repaid past loans and making great strides in growing her business.  She started the business a year ago with money that she managed to save while working at another business.  She plans to use this new loan to buy sacks of rice, sugar, flour and beans, among other things.  She will reinvest her earnings in the business.  Kenia likes to read and her most difficult challenge has been to go to school.  She would like to make herself over for a professional career."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":618509,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy supplies for food business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"San Pedro de Macor\u00eds","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19 -70.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2010-10-17T18:00:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2397.85},{"due_date":"2010-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2443.75},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2567.31},{"due_date":"2011-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2624.98},{"due_date":"2011-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2719.91},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2896.16},{"due_date":"2011-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2923.03},{"due_date":"2011-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3047.91},{"due_date":"2011-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3138.98},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3264.46},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3370.57},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":3492.48},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":112.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":66.8},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.07},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.52},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.13},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.76},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.68},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.43},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.91},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.44},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.94},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.89},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.29},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3.14}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":66.8,"local_amount":2397.85,"processed_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2444.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177395518},{"amount":68.07,"local_amount":2443.75,"processed_date":"2010-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:51:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2491.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182534044},{"amount":71.52,"local_amount":2567.31,"processed_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:58:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2617.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188670812},{"amount":250.24,"local_amount":8982.84,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:03:45Z","rounded_local_amount":9158.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191414181},{"amount":124.15,"local_amount":4456.53,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4543.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195991064},{"amount":130.02,"local_amount":4667.23,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:54:52Z","rounded_local_amount":4758.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201275137},{"amount":133.34,"local_amount":4786.51,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:54:37Z","rounded_local_amount":4880.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206142430},{"amount":130.86,"local_amount":4697.98,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:07:10Z","rounded_local_amount":4789.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211215479}],"funded_date":"2010-10-17T19:11:39Z","paid_date":"2011-06-15T11:07:10Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":242915,"name":"Christine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Christine N. lives in the Mulago neighborhood in the city of Kampala, Uganda.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Mirna has been engaged in her business for over 15 years and earns approximately 4000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mirna joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Mirna is requesting a loan of 7000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 1st loan taken out by Mirna from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
