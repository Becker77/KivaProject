Since her husband\u2019s death. she has been getting support from husband\u2019s relatives. She started her business with only two sheep that were given as a wedding present by her parents. Now she has four cows and two calves. \r\n\r\nAfter an unhappy marriage. her eldest daughter got divorced and now stays with Zhumabubu. She helps her around the house and sells the milk from the cows. Her son and little daughter go to school. Another daughter lives with her husband. Each month, Zhumabubu earns around seventy dollars from selling the milk. She has even been able to buy a new track for the house. She does not like standing on the same spot. \r\n\r\nNow, Zhumabubu needs a loan to purchase one more cow to increase the amount of milk she produces per day. This will help her tremendously to prepare her two children for a new school year and buy them new clothes and school supplies. Zhumabubu\u2019s dream is to open and run a shop near her house.\r\n\r\nKulzhan, Aisuluu, Cholponbubu are like Zhumabubu -- women who do not hesitate to try new things and change their lives. They wisely use what they have been endowed with to grow and go forward.\r\n\r\nKulzhan, a divorced woman, is the mother of one daughter. She makes her living by selling women\u2019s shoes. She has been doing this only for a few months and she already makes a good profit. She needs a loan to purchase new goods and refill her shop.\r\n\r\nThe other member, Aisuluu, is married and has one daughter and one son. It was easy for them to start raising livestock, because her husband and son were engaged in farming. Now Aisuluu needs a loan to purchase one more cow and sell its milk. With the rest of the loan, they intend to purchase hens.\r\n\r\nCholponbubu is fifty one, divorced, and has five children. Her children work abroad and send her money each month. She needs a loan to buy furniture to make her house a better place. She plans to start her own business soon."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1525,"image":{"id":346072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase two cows, one hen, increase the inventory of a shop and by furniture","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Tokmak","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2009-07-01T04:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1525,"lender_count":45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zhumabubu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kulzhan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cholponbiubiu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aisuluu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":65000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":9608},{"due_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":9979},{"due_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":10617},{"due_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":11053},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":11582},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":12161}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":225.42},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":234.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":249.09},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":259.32},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":271.73},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":285.32}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":225.42,"local_amount":9608,"processed_date":"2009-07-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:29:21Z","rounded_local_amount":9715.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63209370},{"amount":234.12,"local_amount":9979,"processed_date":"2009-08-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:09:34Z","rounded_local_amount":10090.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73638930},{"amount":249.09,"local_amount":10617,"processed_date":"2009-09-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:15:45Z","rounded_local_amount":10735.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87078240},{"amount":259.32,"local_amount":11053,"processed_date":"2009-10-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T02:48:20Z","rounded_local_amount":11176.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96993927},{"amount":271.73,"local_amount":11582,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:49:13Z","rounded_local_amount":11711.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103838913},{"amount":285.32,"local_amount":12161,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:17:08Z","rounded_local_amount":12297.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110730703}],"funded_date":"2009-07-01T08:36:03Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:17:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"June Blender","image":123338}},{"id":123625,"name":"Sadia Muhammad Rafiq Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"My name is Sadia and I have lived in a city named Arifwala, Pakistan for the past 18 years.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are both collectively responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nAna is single. To make a living, Ana owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from planting & harvesting rice for sale. Ana has been engaged in her business for over 5 years and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Ana joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Ana has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase fertilizers such as manure. Ana is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the 7th loan taken out by Ana from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

Tampalon, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating one business venture: a food vending business.  Her husband Hansel S., who is 29 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have one child who is three years old.\r\n\r\n Charity joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 3 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Charity has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 8,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 4th loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 which she intends to use to purchase raw materials so that she can continue to save up for the future and support her children's education.  \r\n\r\nCharity S. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\n In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

She has been doing this for several years and the business has done well thanks to her hard work. Every month she makes sweaters in response to the orders placed by her customers.

It's located at an elevation of 2880 meters and its mainstays are farming, livestock, and business.  The Huancayo \u2013 Huancavelica railroad runs to the district.\r\n\r\nOlga is an associate of Bancomunal.  She has three children, ages 19, 11, and 4.  She has been running a small grocery and vegetable store for the past 10 years and has added prepared food to her sales in recent years, she now wants to complement it with coffee and juices.  Each day she adds something to her business in order to make it grow.  Two of her children attend school and the third one is very young.  They don't help her with her business very much, but thanks to the loans she's gotten, she's been able to grow and invest more into her business.\r\n\r\nOlga is asking for a 1,000 PEN loan in order to buy products for her business, and also a juicer so that she can sell juices.  Her dream is to grow with her business so that she can support her children so that they will continue with their studies to the highest achievement.  Olga is motivated by her children.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":591307,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Inventory and a juicer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Huancavelica","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.766667 -74.983333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4475,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yesenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leocadia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mercede","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Alejandrina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benedicta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Enma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ninfa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Estela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":12500,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":4475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.35},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.35},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.35},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.35},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":2083.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":2083.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745.84},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745.84},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":745.84},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":745.84},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745.8},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":745.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

Teachers of this noble institution have come to SMT, a partner of Kiva.org in Makeni, northern Sierra Leone, to seek a loan of SLL 6,500,000 for the entire group. With the help of this loan, this group of teachers will each be able to improve their standard of living. \r\n\r\nFifty-five year old Jessika K. K. is the leader of this group of teachers. Jessika was born in Kailahun, she is married and has 2 children who are in college. Jessika is a teacher and a businesswoman. She has been in the teaching profession for 35 years now. Jessika is going to use her share of this loan to invest in her business. \r\n\r\nSchool staff from this institution, like many other schools staff within SMT\u2019s operational areas, come to SMT to apply for loans. With the help of these loans, they can accomplish some certain tasks that they would otherwise have not been able to accomplish with their mere salaries alone.

(a potato-like tuber) for sale. She has one year of experience in this business.    \r\n\r\nPaosia needs a loan of WST $1,000 to purchase general farm supplies and equipment. She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 260 WST or US $108 per week) to improve and expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, Paosia joined SPBD to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Paosia's first loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 1 to 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the overall social metric score. For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD: \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem. Please join SPBD's lending team on Kiva to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD.

She wants this investment to encourage business growth and to attract more customers.\r\n\r\nThe remaining members of the group are:\r\nRoque who sells groceries\r\nFiliberto who sells groceries\r\nAdrian who sells bread\r\nEsperanza who sells groceries\r\nJulian who sell groceries\r\nDaniela who sells groceries\r\nGuadalupe who is a dressmaker\r\nLuz Elena who sells groceries\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1350,"image":{"id":984431,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"buy cooking oil, rice, beans, creams, canned chiles, coffee, candles, matches, toilet paper, toothpaste, soap, clorox, soft drinks, and sweets to sell.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2012-01-22T20:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1350,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roque ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emeranda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Filiberto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Adrian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Julian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Daniela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Guadalupe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false},{"first_name":"Luz Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2250},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":2250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":168.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:28:09Z","rounded_local_amount":4527.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257193944},{"amount":506.25,"local_amount":6750,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:41:37Z","rounded_local_amount":6791.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263330302},{"amount":337.5,"local_amount":4500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":4527.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270044320},{"amount":168.75,"local_amount":2250,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2263.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276656512}],"funded_date":"2012-01-23T04:51:30Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T09:49:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Harold Sims","image":602722}},{"id":481239,"name":"Francisco Tito","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Francisco es un hombre de 36 a\u00f1os, vive en la ciudad de Caman\u00e1 con su esposa, \u00e9l es una persona muy amable, trabajador y entusiasta, que tiene un gran deseo de superaci\u00f3n;

Previously she offered her services to clothing business in various shopping centers, like the File Halter shopping center that is currently trying to grow its small businesses in order to achieve a greater market abroad. As she is separated, during the whole time that her four children were underage she could never save enough to invest to begin her own business, because all of her profits were used to cover the expenses of raising her children. Nevertheless, when they grew and became independent economically, Lida could begin her dream of having her own business. One of her first investments was to buy industrial sewing machines to make and repair clothes. She already has four. Since four years ago, she has a rented a space in a shopping center where she sells the clothes she produces. During the busy season, she contracts a person to help with production. Now she uses her profits to cover her personal expenses and to help support her mother who lives in Juliaca. She began to take out loans with EDAPROSPO, an affiliate of Kiva, six months ago. But she already has plans to use her loans in the future in order to buy a local space to stabilize her business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lois Parshley, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":150,"image":{"id":287468,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Invest in a showcase to better display her products.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He does all types of sandwiches and burgers; he also makes \u201cfalafel\u201d sandwiches and \u201ckebab\u201d. <P>\r\n\r\nFalafel is very popular in the Middle East as a fast food. As a main dish, it is served as a sandwich, stuffed in pita bread with lettuce, tomatoes, and tahini. As an appetizer, it is served on a salad, or with hummus and tahini. As for the Kebabs or also known as \"shish kebab\": Shish kebab is translated to 'skewer of grilled meat' and includes many variations of the kebab; therefore, there are several spellings, such as kabob, kebob, kebap, kabab, and kebab. <P>\r\n\r\nWhen Hussein first started his business, he had to pass through some financial issues because he wasn\u2019t really known and didn\u2019t have his own customers. Hussein decided on doing his business because of his experience. Hussein requested a loan from Al Majmoua in order to purchase merchandise for his restaurant and a coffee machine. This machine will help him to start serving coffee and expand his snack food into a real restaurant. This is his second loan and he repaid the first loan on time. His customers are people from his region. In the future, he plans on improving his business.

Having had eight group loans, all of which she repaid on time, she is now on her third individual loan (the two previous ones having also been repaid on time). \r\n\r\nShe is planning on  buying sacks of wheat flower from wholesalers in Koutiala; she sells her goods at the Kouloukoro market and at home to a customer base which is predominantly feminine, for cash and on credit.\r\n\r\nWith the reinforcement of her business, she expects to make an average profit of 75,000FCFA per month, which she plans to use to pay the interest on her loan from Soro, to contribute to her family's expenses and to look after herself as well as her children. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":534815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchase of wheat flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Koutiala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-05-03T18:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aminata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:25Z","rounded_local_amount":43374.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779268},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:00Z","rounded_local_amount":43374.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961480},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:29Z","rounded_local_amount":43374.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699600},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:34Z","rounded_local_amount":43374.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913487},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:08Z","rounded_local_amount":43374.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180652},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":41666.65,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:26Z","rounded_local_amount":43374.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476623}],"funded_date":"2010-05-03T23:41:12Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":202359,"name":"Esterlita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Esterlita D. is from the village of Camanucan.

Dilshod lives in Gonchi, a region in Northern Tajikistan. He is 29 years old, married with two children. Dilshod is the sole provider for his family and earns his living by raising and selling cows at the local market. His wife helps him with the business. Once every 2-3 months he purchases young animals from local villagers and raises them over an 8-9 month period and later sells the adult cows to local butchers. Today Dilshod is thinking about expanding his business, as his current earnings are not enough to provide for his family. He plans to purchase young cattle.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a hard-working woman who strives to provide the best she can for her daughter, Briyid, who is 11 years old.  They live together in a rented house in the Kimbiri district.  They used to live in their own home but, because of family problems, had to move out.  Her parents taught her how to work to make a living for herself.  Her business is buying products such as coffee, cocoa, annatto and tumeric, mainly forest area crops, from the indians.  She's been in the business for four years and has the help of workers who load and weigh the items she purchases.  She uses a vehicle to travel around to different communities in search of her products which she then transfers to the well-known co-ops such as \"Cooperativa Agraria\", \"Cacao Vrae\" and \"Machupichu\" who pay her a percentage for each kilogram she delivers.\r\n\r\nHer business is very profitable and she receives an annual premium from the co-ops.  The months of January, February and March are the rainy season and roads are flooded, so during these months she lags behind in her business.

Before joining the transportation service, Volodymyr used to work in the state security service, but then, after his wife gave birth to a daughter, he left that employment and started working as a taxi driver.

She lives in a Haitian community where unemployment rates and poverty are seen in large percentages.

In five years, she hopes to build a home of her own. Benise feels that it is very hard to live in a country and a house that is not her own. She is very appreciative of the opportunity that she is now getting and desperately wants to improve her life.

Juanita is married, 36 years old, and the mother of 3 children (2 girls and 1 boy).  Her children are what motivate her to face the difficulties life presents her with.  Because Juanita is a strong woman who works hard, she was able to start her own business, selling flowers and gifts, with her first loan of 300 soles.  Day-by-day she worked to grow her client base by treating her clients well and offering good prices.  \r\n\r\nCurrently she is continuing with the same business, but she is expanding.  She will sell more products because of the high demand from her neighbors and friends, who are her clients.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan of 1,500 soles (that will be paid off in 6 months) she will buy more products to stock her store.  She will purchase items like:  baby clothes, artificial flowers, and gift items like kitchen accessories, stuffed animals, toys, and make up.  She tells us that she is very optimistic and grateful for the opportunity to get a loan which helps her develop as a woman and as a small business owner.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Shelly Hubman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":316256,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"compra de ropa para bebes, flores artificiales, accesorios para cocina, peluches, juguetes, cosm\u00e9ticos","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-05-11T17:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:41:32Z","rounded_local_amount":261.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44590979},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:23:00Z","rounded_local_amount":261.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52985263},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:13:02Z","rounded_local_amount":261.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63205654},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:43:58Z","rounded_local_amount":261.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73634873},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:41:21Z","rounded_local_amount":261.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074009},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T01:56:07Z","rounded_local_amount":261.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989467}],"funded_date":"2009-05-17T19:38:58Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T01:56:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shelly Hubman","image":226625}},{"id":111385,"name":"Renacer Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El presente comit\u00e9 se encuentra en su decimo ciclo del programa de mujeres de la Fundacion Paraguay y es un comit\u00e9 ejemplar.

A. es un  se\u00f1or de 58 a\u00f1os de edad quien vive con su esposa en una comunidad llamada El Sauce de Santa Teresita de Turrialba, Provincia de Cartago.  Es una peque\u00f1a comunidad rural de aproximadamente dos mil habitantes. Sus pobladores se dedican a la producci\u00f3n de leche y siembra de caf\u00e9. Tiene un relieve irregular y mucho del terreno se mantiene como bosque tropical h\u00famedo. La comunidad tiene paisajes muy pintorescos que combinan el bosque tropical con dos lindas lagunas, plantaciones de caf\u00e9 y lecher\u00edas. El Sauce se localiza aproximadamente a hora y media en bus de Turrialba, el centro de comercio m\u00e1s cercano. Sin embargo, varias veces al a\u00f1o el camino se vuelve intransitable por las lluvias que azotan la zona. Este es sin duda uno de los principales desaf\u00edos para la comunidad. \n\nCuando no exist\u00edan actividades muchas personas optaron por salir a buscar trabajos en Turrialba o en fincas bananeras ubicadas en la Zona Atl\u00e1ntica de Costa Rica.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Norma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from HSPFI, which she used to to purchase additional products to sell. Norma is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding her business. This loan will be Norma's 3rd loan from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

L. is an 18 year-old youth who lives with her husband and their son in a community called Santa Fe, located in Los Chiles in the Alajuela province. This community is in a mountainous region that is located very close to the northern border of the country. The main economic activities are livestock and agriculture, specifically the cultivation of staple grains, sugar cane and oranges.\r\n\r\nFlor has a small piece of land where she has cultivated different crops such as papaya and bananas, but three years ago she started to grow yams.  Yams are root vegetables that taste good, are rich in nutrients and are processed in large volume by the local agro-industry. There is great demand for this product in Costa Rica as well as in other countries.  She tells us that since she dedicated her production entirely to this product her income has increased.\r\n\r\nNow Flor is requesting a loan of 623,000 Costa Rican colones to help with the preparation of the soil by purchasing of seeds, fertilizers and other supplies that are needed to guarantee the optimal cultivation of yams.  Flor is a member of the communal bank \"Manatial de Santa Fe,\" one of the 100 organizations that are members of EDESA in Costa Rica.

She lives with her husband and children in a house they own in San Ramon, a town in Peru's central selva.  Her life took a big turn when she had to overcome hardships to get ahead.  She used to help her husband operate a pharmacy, called San Pedro (or St. Peter, in honor of the keeper of the keys to heaven) but she decided, 20 years ago, that she needed an extra income so she rented a space and opened a \"locutorio\" (to provide phone-calling services).  She realized, too, that she could use the store to sell merchandise that is always in demand in this hot, wet part of Peru: snacks, sweets, crackers, soft drinks, etc.  The business was a good one until family problems forced her to close it.  Now, with the experience she's gained, she wants to reopen the business so that she can increase her income and save for what she might need in the future.  She's also thinking about opening a general store, selling a wider range of everyday products that everyone needs.

At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nArcelita operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a PHP 5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this, she sells mineral water for added income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of PHP 250 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a PHP 11,000 loan. She will use the loan to buy groceries, toiletries, beverages and other products needed in her business. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nArcelita hopes her business will be stable and dreams of giving her children a good and high quality education through all her hard work in her business.

Nonetheless, her husband, who works as a sales clerk, is by her side and helps support her.  She has a bakery  on the premises of her house where she bakes a variety of breads.  She has been running her business for 5 years and has been very successful.  One advantage of only having to support herself and her husband is that there are much fewer expenses and they are able to live a comfortable and tranquil life.  One thing she likes about her business is that many people come from various places to purchase her bread for its good quality and delicious taste.  The high quality of her breads and her strategic location help to ensure the profitability of her bakery.  In the future, Maria would like to have an ice cream shop to compliment the pastries in her bakery.  She has had 9 loans through MFP and she likes to work with her communal bank because there is a sense of unity and understanding amongst her colleagues.

The different activities between the clients of the group is the sale of bread, crackers, sweets, sandals, neighborhood grocery stores, sodas, shoes and motor-taxi service for pickup and delivery. Everyday the competition with respect to their businesses is difficult so they have to work very hard so they can move forward with their businesses.\r\n<p>\r\n The credit will be used in the purchase of Christmas merchandise because in this season demand is high and they need to change areas in order to have higher income.

She is an enterprising businesswoman who lives in the neighborhood of La Playa in Barranquilla.  She is 63 years old and has three children between the ages of 23 and 42.  Miriam manages a business selling different types of merchandise based on the time of year.  With the loan of 1,500,000 COP that she is requesting, she will buy fabrics and accessories (such as borders) for making uniforms for the local high school.\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cEverything for less\u201d is the slogan for Miriam\u2019s business where she sells many things.  For ten years, she sold school shoes and for seven years, she sold ice cream and catalog merchandise.  Her business now includes the production and sale of \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chicha\" target=\"_blank\" >chicha<\/a>\u201d, a beverage made from corn or rice, and \u201cbolis\u201d (a traditional form of ice cream found in Colombia).  She also makes handicrafts made of woven threads, painted fabrics, or frosted glass.  In addition she sells merchandise through catalog or by request such as shoes, women\u2019s accessories (earrings, costume jewelry, etc.), and reading material.  \r\n<p>\r\nMiriam learned about the Foundation five years ago from neighbors and through other recommendations.  Since then she has taken out seven loans.   Miriam is very careful with her loans and tries to take advantage of all of the services offered by the Foundation, such as the licensing program provided through the Chamber of Commerce.  She also enjoys fun activities, such as playing bingo or taking walks.  The courses she has taken have updated her knowledge in selling products that are always in fashion.  Miriam believes her working relationship with the Foundation has been a positive experience, so she remains active and tries to obtain as much as she can as long as the benefits are useful.  She now dreams of finishing the home in which she lives with her family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva

Her day begins early in the morning, when she milks the cows and takes the milk for sale. For fifteen years the milk has provided her an income of around five thousand soms per month. This isn\u2019t a whole lot of money  considering the fact that she\u2019s got three children, so for the past year she has been trying to find herself an additional source of income.\r\n\r\nAside from the cattle, Ainura has all manner of poultry, and some sheep and bulls.  If the need arises, she can take her cattle to the bazaar and sell them to get money for everyday needs or emergencies.  She has a preschooler right now and she realizes that before long her expenses will go up, so, she and her husband, who has farming experience from way back, decided that they would raise crops, too.  It was quite a significant decision because they were at the point of really needing to diversify their sources of income.  \r\n\r\nAinura and her husband have managed to expand their herd of cattle, fix up their house and substantially improve their living conditions.  Ainura goes about her work gamely, too, knowing that she\u2019ll always have the support she needs from her husband, who helps her diligently with the business and sticks by her side.  She needs a loan at this time to get the items she needs for farming.\r\n\r\nAinura\u2019s partners in the group are:\r\n\r\nAinura M. is thirty-eight, married, and has five children.  Her eldest son is twenty and the youngest is only a year and a half old.  She raises cattle and sells the milk.  Her husband is a cab driver.  Not long ago, she and her husband started raising crops and now they are in need of a loan so they can proceed to work their land.\r\n\r\nDinara Z. is twenty-nine and the mother of three children.  Her husband works in law-enforcement and she\u2019s a hair stylist.  Recently she and her husband began the huge undertaking of building a barn.  Now they really need building materials, but their combined incomes don\u2019t suffice.  They really need the loan.\r\n\r\nZholochu A. is forty-four-years-old and the father of five children.  In order to feed his family he raises and sells sheep.  His wife works at a vodka factory.  Three of the children are preschool and school-aged, so Zholochu decided that he would farm, too.  He hopes to receive this loan for his agricultural work.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Jill Heske, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":541113,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to sow the land with agricultural products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Karabalta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-05-21T17:30:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ainura ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ainura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dinara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zholochu","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":50000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":7497},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":7701},{"due_date":"2010-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8123},{"due_date":"2010-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":8458},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":8918},{"due_date":"2010-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":9303}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":164.93},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":169.43},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":178.7},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":186.08},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.19},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":164.93,"local_amount":7497,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:45:34Z","rounded_local_amount":7568.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144748703},{"amount":169.43,"local_amount":7701,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-11T07:46:01Z","rounded_local_amount":7774.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151931696},{"amount":178.7,"local_amount":8123,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":8200.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159670708},{"amount":186.08,"local_amount":8458,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:32Z","rounded_local_amount":8538.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884356},{"amount":196.19,"local_amount":8918,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:09Z","rounded_local_amount":9002.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172151486},{"amount":204.67,"local_amount":9303,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:10:17Z","rounded_local_amount":9391.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177446510}],"funded_date":"2010-05-23T23:14:56Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T15:10:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":206487,"name":"Rose","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rose K. is currently in the business of selling bedsheets at the market.

Con el apoyo de este financiamiento ella podra surtir su negocio de ropa y de sandalias de diferentes colores y estilos para satisfacer a sus clientes. \n\nMuy contenta Kenia expreso que con los prestamos obtenidos en FAMA a podido ir mejorando su casa y tambien pudo comprar su refrigeradora y eso le ha a ayudado a ahorrar algunos centavos porque antes se le arruinaban algunos productos que necesitaban refrigeracion.\n\nSu meta es seguir apoyando a sus hijos para que culminen sus estudios academicos y su sue\u00f1o es culminar las mejoras de su casa. Kenia tiene mas de dieciseis ciclos en FAMA y ha cancelado sus cuotas puntualmente.\n\n","en":"The 'Unidas para Vencer' community bank has ten members who are engaged in different business activities in the village of San Nicolas, in Juticalpa.  The bank's coordinator is Kenia Jacqueline and she sells second-hand clothes and sandals.  She is 33 years old, married, and has three sons.\r\n\r\nSix years ago, following the example of one of her neighbors, Kenia decided to start selling second-hand clothes and bought her first bundle of clothes with the financial support of her husband.  Although it wasn't a lot, it was enough to get her started.  Her business doesn't have a name because she makes her sales as an itinerant vendor.  She also sometimes makes sales from her home when her neighbors or friends come to find her.  The biggest difficulty that Kenia faces is the rainy season because it means she can't go out and she loses sales.  She also has problems when she sells merchandise on credit because sometimes her customers take a long time to pay her back.\r\n\r\nKenia needs the loan that she is requesting to buy a bundle of second-hand clothes and also to buy sandals so that she can do something a little different with her business.  With the support of this loan, she will be able to stock her business with clothes and sandales in different colors and styles in order to satisfy her customers.\r\n\r\nKenia commented very happily that, as a result of the loans she has received from FAMA, she has been able to continue improving her home and has also been able to buy a refrigerator.  This has helped her to save a few cents because, before she bought the refrigerator, some products that needed refrigerating used to go off.\r\n\r\nKenia's goal is to continue supporting her children so that they finish their education.  Her dream is to finish carrying out improvements to her home.  Kenia has been working with FAMA for more than 16 loan cycles and she has made her repayments punctually."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":864529,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy bundles of second-hand clothes and sandals","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-09-11T10:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Bernarda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kenia Jacquelin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leda Suyapa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gesi Elminta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edith Francisca ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gladys Ondina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ada Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Emma Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":20500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2011-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5125},{"due_date":"2011-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":5125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":5125,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T08:51:51Z","rounded_local_amount":5176.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232784962},{"amount":275,"local_amount":5125,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:53:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5176.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238589359},{"amount":275,"local_amount":5125,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:46:40Z","rounded_local_amount":5176.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244547454},{"amount":275,"local_amount":5125,"processed_date":"2011-12-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:52:43Z","rounded_local_amount":5176.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250758092}],"funded_date":"2011-09-15T13:21:16Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T09:52:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":337631,"name":"Evangeline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Evangeline is 61 years old and married.

Since the time is approaching when she is asked for graduation gowns, caps, and men's suits she needs fine quality fabric to satisfy her customers.

He is known for his honesty and compassion, extending credit to families that would otherwise go hungry between paydays.  With this loan he plans to increase his inventory and provide a working capital cushion.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Roma, commonly known as gypsies, is a severely marginalized social group in Bulgaria and throughout the Balkans.<\/p>\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":1077,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital (inventory)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BG","country":"Bulgaria","town":"Sliven","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"42.685833 26.329167","type":"point"}},"partner_id":3,"posted_date":"2006-09-06T22:39:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Portocal","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-09-26T21:38:09Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2006-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2006-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83.33},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":83.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2006-12-07T17:39:20Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":2900},{"amount":130,"local_amount":130,"processed_date":"2007-02-12T13:36:03Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":130,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":7364},{"amount":304,"local_amount":304,"processed_date":"2007-03-21T02:01:46Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":304,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10690},{"amount":294,"local_amount":294,"processed_date":"2007-06-15T11:26:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":294,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23292},{"amount":141,"local_amount":141,"processed_date":"2007-07-30T12:15:19Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":141,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":37101},{"amount":71,"local_amount":71,"processed_date":"2007-10-23T10:44:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":71082},{"amount":211,"local_amount":211,"processed_date":"2007-11-26T13:03:31Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":211,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87109},{"amount":71,"local_amount":71,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T12:49:23Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106707},{"amount":12,"local_amount":12,"processed_date":"2008-07-28T07:17:35Z","settlement_date":"2008-07-28T09:28:01Z","rounded_local_amount":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":279244}],"funded_date":"2006-09-12T21:38:09Z","paid_date":"2008-07-28T07:17:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":4897,"name":"Elnur","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elnur H. is an Internally-Displaced Person (IDP) from the Lachin region of Azerbaijan.

She later married and started a family. Due to the need to stay at home to care for her children, she got the idea of starting up the business she currently has. Things have gone well for her, since she is the only person in the neighborhood who sells these products. She has always noticed the unmet needs of consumers and realized that there was no good place for visitors to stay in Mache, so she opened a small hostel. <p>She is one of the founding members of the \u201cMujeres con Futuro\u201d (Women with a Future) communal bank, which she joined 5 years ago. The first loan she received was for S\/. 300.00 and she used the money to start her agriculture\/veterinary supply store. <p>With this loan of S\/. 2000.00, which she will repay in 4 months, she will buy 1 box of Hieloxil, a product that is used to cure infections of potato plants and which is very much in demand during this season; 1 box of Tif\u00f3n, which is for killing weevils; and 1 box of Extrafox. <p>Santos dreams of having another business location, which she would make into a large and modern hardware store. <p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. <p><\/b>La se\u00f1ora Santos Evelia Rodr\u00edguez A. tiene 40 a\u00f1os de edad.
