\r\n\r\n<br><br><b>Background on BRAC and BRAC Uganda<\/b><br><br>\r\nBRAC (Building Resources Across Communities) is a development organization that began operations in Bangladesh as a small-scale relief and rehabilitation project in 1972 to help the country overcome the devastation and trauma of the liberation war and focused on resettling refugees returning from India. Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

They are a hardworking family who cares about the wellbeing of everyone.  Yolanda has always loved cooking, since she spent a lot of time with her mother in the kitchen while growing up.  Her mother slowly taught her all of the recipes and over the years she began adding her own ingredients.  One day she realized that she had a gift for cooking and she began to sell her food.  The advantage of her job is that she gets to work from home, but it is also an enormous sacrifice to transport her food orders to faraway places.  The long hours are very tiring for her.  Because of this she decided to also begin working in buying and selling automobiles.  She and her husband discovered that this is a very profitable business that does not require a lot of physical strength but rather a capacity for negotiation.  Yolanda is loyal to MFP\u2014she has been working with them for 3 years and intends to continue doing so, along with the other members in her group.  She will invest 1,000 soles in kitchen supplies that she needs in order to improve her service for her customers and increase the amount of food that she sells.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":286927,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Kitchen supplies","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-03-17T23:00:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","amount":151.98},{"due_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":154.47},{"due_date":"2009-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":162.72},{"due_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":169.23},{"due_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":177.66},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":183.94}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":49.39},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.2},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.88},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.74},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":49.39,"local_amount":151.98,"processed_date":"2009-03-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:41:12Z","rounded_local_amount":158.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117236},{"amount":50.2,"local_amount":154.47,"processed_date":"2009-04-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:51:18Z","rounded_local_amount":161.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36012154},{"amount":52.88,"local_amount":162.72,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:58:36Z","rounded_local_amount":170.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595739},{"amount":55,"local_amount":169.23,"processed_date":"2009-06-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:58Z","rounded_local_amount":176.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990002},{"amount":57.74,"local_amount":177.66,"processed_date":"2009-07-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:45:39Z","rounded_local_amount":185.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211135},{"amount":59.79,"local_amount":183.94,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":192.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640642}],"funded_date":"2009-03-18T00:39:29Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:28:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Crouch","image":59003}},{"id":98757,"name":"Dorothy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Dorothy A. is 33 years old and married with four children.

It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Antonia H. formed the group with her god-daughter, Margarita G. R., and Maria Marlene G. H.. Each of the three are in diifferent lines of work. Antonia is seeking the loan to buy coconuts, to sell along with horchata (a local soft drink), for which she needs ingredients such as sugar, milk and cinnamon. She will also have the support of her husband, David Vazquez Farelo, who will go out and sell them.\r\n\r\nThe second member of the group, Margarita G. R., sells clothes, including trousers, T-shirts, shirts and blouses among other things. The third member of the group, Maria Marlene G. H., sells agricultural supplies.\r\n\r\nAntonia is happy and content that she has already benefited by investing in products such as these. She says there has been no difficulty with her husband going out and selling them in the park in Copinala Chiapas, which is just five minutes from their home. Her most treasured dream is to keep working with this loan, and save up so she can help her grandchildren through school.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rosa Oswald, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":553443,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft Drinks","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy coconuts and ingredients such as sugar, milk and cinnamon","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"COPAINAL\u00c1, CHIAPAS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-06-23T18:30:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Antonia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Marlene","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":928.19},{"due_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":947.85},{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":967.93},{"due_date":"2010-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":988.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1009.37},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":1030.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":1052.58},{"due_date":"2010-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":1074.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.42},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.01},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.64},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.01},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.75},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.52},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":152.43,"local_amount":1876.04,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":1924.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151899594},{"amount":158.95,"local_amount":1956.36,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:17:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2007.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159639941},{"amount":144.16,"local_amount":1774.22,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:21:27Z","rounded_local_amount":1820.27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166854223},{"amount":194.46,"local_amount":2393.38,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-18T07:59:16Z","rounded_local_amount":2455.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121120}],"funded_date":"2010-06-24T04:40:52Z","paid_date":"2010-10-18T07:59:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosa Oswald","image":null}},{"id":214324,"name":"Hong Leng's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Hong Leng H. is 36 years old and is the village bank president, having been selected by its nineteen members who are located in Kraom village, Takeo province.

She sews clothes for her neighboring clients and earns income for her family. She has been doing this work for many years and is well known in her region. She used to do this work on a part-time basis, but she has since started working full-time and has become the earning hand for her family. \r\n\r\nBesides her sewing business, she also manages her household chores very well. She keeps her family happy through her good behavior and helps them to solve their problems. She has applied for a loan from Kiva's partner, Asasah, to improve her sewing business. With the loan, she will buy a new sewing machine because her current machine has become old and takes much time to sew a single dress. Arshan is hopeful that through this investment she will take her business to a more profitable position. \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, Arshan is the lady holding a book (called the Asasah

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He very much enjoys working with his communal bank, for which he is the president and and carries out his work with great responsibility.

When all members of a family are united, this family will always be able to easily overcome temporary difficulties. Monishon Y., the leader of this group, has such a family.\r\n\r\nMonishon is forty years old and has raised three children. Her husband works as a security guard in a hospital. As to Monishon, she is engaged in selling milk and milk products. She can always rely on her family, be it her husband or her daughters.\r\n\r\nIn the past, they used to just farm their piece of land. However, later, they were able to save sufficient funds to purchase cattle. Since then, they have also been breeding cattle, which has allowed them to buy new furniture for their house. Monishon\u2019s daughters often sell milk from her business and they do their best to help their mother out.\r\n\r\nMonishon realizes that there is much work ahead. She plans to marry her daughter, provide a college education for her other two daughters and also make an extensive repair of their house.\r\n\r\nNow, Monishon\u2019s monthly income is around 70 USD, and this is not sufficient to save money. She needs a loan to purchase sheep or goats to raise. That way she will be able to increase her income.\r\n\r\nMonishon\u2019s partners:\r\n\r\nMotaborhon M., 41, is married and has a son. Her husband is a builder. Motaborhon is engaged in selling milk and milk products. Besides that, she works as a nurse. She needs a loan to purchase sheep to raise.\r\n\r\nRohathan T., 36, has three daughters and breeds sheep. All her daughters are school students and, in their free time, actively help their parents to look after the cattle. Rohathan has applied for this loan to purchase some sheep to increase the total population of their livestock.\r\n\r\nHafisahon U., 27, is engaged in breeding sheep but her regular job is in a hospital where she works as a nurse. She is married and, for now, does not have children. She hopes to obtain this loan and purchase sheep for breeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---<\/b>\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of the 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable in order to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

The Ollantaytambo district is in the province of Urubamba, department of Cuzco, located 91 km. from Cuzco on the highway.  Ollantaytambo is a charming city that dates back to the time of the Incas, built on the base of the ancient Inca city.\r\n\r\nEpifan\u00eda had traditionally worked in farming, but today sees tourism as the opportunity to improve her standard of living.  She has a sales booth in the Ma\u00f1araqui crafts market, where she sells \u201cchullos\u201d (Peruvian hat with earflaps maD. from vicu\u00f1a, alpaca, llama or sheep's wool), gloves, hats, bags, purses, ponchos, and she also sells soft drinks and mineral water.  She started this business 30 years ago with a little capital, but she now has a stand and belongs to the Ollantaytambo crafts association.  She can be found in her stand, which is stocked with a variety of crafts.  She goes out to sell three times a week, from 8 in the morning until very late, or until all tourists have left the market.  Epifan\u00eda appears to be a hard-working, reliable woman.  Crowds of tourists visit the market, and business is quite lively when they come to see the beautiful Inca ruins.  She sells her goods at prices that are appropriate and reasonable for her customers, and especially good quality, which is what distinguishes her from her colleagues at work.\r\n\r\nEpifan\u00eda hopes to get $300 USD for her next loan.  For now, she wants to increase her working capital and will buy more merchandise, such as chullos, bags, gloves, ponchos, and many other products.  This way, she can stock her booth, for this is the time when many tourists visit the Inca ruins and buy crafts.  Epifan\u00eda belongs to the Ollantaytambo Friendship communal bank, the name given in honor of the friendship enjoyed by all its members.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Jane Wilkie, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":575305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"To buy more merchandise, such as Peruvian-style caps, bags, gloves, ponchos, and other products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ollantaytambo - Urubamba - Cusco","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":119,"posted_date":"2010-08-01T22:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Epifania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":71.71},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":73.86},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76.08},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":78.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.71},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.86},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":76.08},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":71.8,"local_amount":71.8,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:41:22Z","rounded_local_amount":71.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166801193},{"amount":73.96,"local_amount":73.96,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:43:45Z","rounded_local_amount":73.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172070966},{"amount":76.17,"local_amount":76.17,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:02:19Z","rounded_local_amount":76.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177362263},{"amount":78.07,"local_amount":78.07,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T10:06:59Z","rounded_local_amount":78.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182497171}],"funded_date":"2010-08-01T23:43:47Z","paid_date":"2010-12-16T10:06:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Jane Wilkie","image":null}},{"id":222533,"name":"Mary Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mary Jane M., from the village of Balzain West, Tuguegarao City, is 46 years old.

She lives in Proper Mahawak, Brgy. Mahawak, Medellin, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2006 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her general store business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Danninova is now borrowing PHP 10,000 to purchase more stock to sell. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Danninova aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History \r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is 70 years old, and lives with her family in the wonderful province of Lim\u00f3n, which has great cultural diversity.  It's population is predominantly black, and the culture includes important features brought by the indigenous Costa Ricans, Afro-Carrribeans, whites, and Chinese.  Each group brought their own contribution to the area.  \r\n\r\nThis province is beautiful with white sand, beaches and palm trees, and exuberant national parks that protect the tropical rainforests and coral reefs, and hundreds of species of flora and fauna that are en route to extinction.  The Tortuguero national park contains the largest area of protected tropical rainforest.  You can explore its waterways and rivers to observe the flora and fauna, see the egg-laying of the sea-turtles, and have the opportunity to spot more than 300 species of birds including green macaws, peacocks, and toucans.  Important scientific research takes place in this region, and it has become a unique location for scientific and ecological tourism.\r\n\r\nFor several months, Flor has been working as a secretary for her communal bank.  This is why she is asking to be provided with some kind of  technological support, so that she can work more efficiently.  This is the reason that Flor is requesting a loan for 400,000 (four hundred thousand) colones, so that she can get a complete computer set-up for the communal bank, and so be able to create reports and keep the books for this organization.\r\n\r\nFlor is a member of the Bat\u00e1n communal bank, which is one of EDESA's 110 member organizations in Costa Rica.  She tells us that by belonging to this communal bank, she has been able to purchase fabric, given that she works in sewing as previously mentioned.  It has also helped her to repair several parts of her home.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan, and this loan will enhance the quality of her work for this communal bank."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":900614,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Consumer Goods","sector":"Personal

This motivated her to start selling clothes, and her sales have been very good.\r\n\r\nShe later requested a loan and increased her inventory.  She now also sells sandals and lotions.  Reina is a very hard-worker.  She also has coffee crops, where she gets other income.\r\n\r\nThe requested loan is to stock more clothes and lotions because the Christmas season is coming.\r\n\r\nHer dream is for her children to graduate and to fix up her house with the income that she will get.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":918040,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to stock up on merchandise like blouses, pants, and lotions.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"San Juan, Lempira","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":201,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T08:01:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Reina Adelina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":18000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2011-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1500},{"due_date":"2012-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":1500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:05:00Z","rounded_local_amount":3000.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250854560},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:32:55Z","rounded_local_amount":1500.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257264324},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:45:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1500.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263405534},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:47:20Z","rounded_local_amount":1500.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270119995},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:49:31Z","rounded_local_amount":1500.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276737053},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:53:38Z","rounded_local_amount":1500.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283227503},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":1500.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287376366},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-16T09:09:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1500.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294637025},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1500,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1500.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301482640},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2012-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-10-16T09:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":3000.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308476055}],"funded_date":"2011-12-20T18:01:30Z","paid_date":"2012-10-16T09:40:13Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":361898,"name":"Juana Marta","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Juana, de 66 a\u00f1os, es comerciante due\u00f1a de una pulper\u00eda, viuda, tiene hijos son  mayores de edad.

He is married with 3 children aged between 1 and 7 years. 1of them go to school. He is a farmer and he has been growing maize for the past 8 years. While his wife is a business woman. With the loan from Kiva, he would like to pay workers who harvested maize. The profits from the business will be used to pay school fees of her children and to pay medical insurance.\n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations.

L. is a Ugandan by nationality, an Acholi by tribe, and is 38 years of age. She is a married woman with four children. L. and her family left Gulu because of the war that was in the north. It was so terrible to the extent that it took so many people's lives. In 1998, L. and her family fled to Kampala and settled on the land (the Acholi Quarters) which was offered to them by the King of Buganda to settle on since he had sympathy for the people of northern Uganda.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhen Christine settled in the camp, she began to work in the stone quarry to earn some income. From the stone quarry, she was earning 1000 \/= (about 60 cents; the symbol \/= here stands for Uganda shillings) per day.

She does well but with a large family she needs to increase her income to provide for their needs.\r\n<br><br>\r\nChristine's plan is to add capital to expand her business. Demand is high but she needs to add stock to meet this demand.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He used a previous loan to repair damage to one side of the cab and now it looks better.\r\n<p>\r\nHe needs a MXN$3,300 loan, to be repaid in 8 14-day installments, to buy tires and servicing, along with some other repairs that will allow him to provide a safer and more comfortable service to his customers.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":275709,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Taxi","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Buy tires and service cab for taxi business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Tampico, Tamaulipas","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"22.216667 -97.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2009-02-20T21:40:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ismael","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":3300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":412.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":412.5,"processed_date":"2009-02-27T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T07:53:57Z","rounded_local_amount":457.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20350022},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":412.5,"processed_date":"2009-03-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T08:59:50Z","rounded_local_amount":457.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037299},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":412.5,"processed_date":"2009-03-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:01:49Z","rounded_local_amount":457.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27037300},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":412.5,"processed_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":457.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927712},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":412.5,"processed_date":"2009-04-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:20:23Z","rounded_local_amount":457.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35927713},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":412.5,"processed_date":"2009-05-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:20:48Z","rounded_local_amount":457.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382782},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":412.5,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:06Z","rounded_local_amount":457.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44382783},{"amount":31.25,"local_amount":412.5,"processed_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:16Z","rounded_local_amount":457.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52889466}],"funded_date":"2009-02-20T22:04:41Z","paid_date":"2010-12-05T10:21:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":94693,"name":"Yom","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Yom S. lives in Tonle village in Takeo province.

He also works at a veterinary clinic.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe work in the fields is tiring, but they almost never rest so that they can provide for the future and come to have a bigger plot of land.

Profits from his business allowed him to build a better barn for his animals and help his sons start their own households. Currently Mukan owns a cow, a calf, a horse, 10 sheep, 10 lambs and 5 goats, and his business yields a monthly profit of 17,000 som (KGS). To further enlarge his herd, Mukan has turned to \"Bai-Tushum and partners\" for a loan of 106,000 som (KGS) to purchase additional heads of cattle.

She is involved in all types of work, such as taking care of the children, making national pies in her free time and selling them at a school.  And at home, having obtained our first loan, she purchased calves and fattens them up.  This business for her is like extra savings for unforeseen family expenses because she can always spend something, once she sells calves.  The client's family conditions are not very good, and this is why she is involved in several businesses.  Nevertheless, Matluba works punctually and diligently runs her budget.  She is obtaining her next loan to purchase livestock and is very happy that she is partnering with us to have this financial support, when she needs it."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":943966,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase livestock","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Khujand","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"40.28 69.631667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2011-12-14T17:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Matluba","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":116.73},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":120.57},{"due_date":"2012-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":124.54},{"due_date":"2012-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":128.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":132.87},{"due_date":"2012-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":137.24},{"due_date":"2012-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":141.75},{"due_date":"2012-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":146.42},{"due_date":"2012-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":151.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":26.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.63},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.54},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.48},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.45},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.45},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.48},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":26.75,"local_amount":116.73,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-18T09:10:09Z","rounded_local_amount":127.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257754408},{"amount":27.63,"local_amount":120.57,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:09Z","rounded_local_amount":131.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263381599},{"amount":28.54,"local_amount":124.54,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:25:31Z","rounded_local_amount":135.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270095117},{"amount":29.48,"local_amount":128.63,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:55:33Z","rounded_local_amount":140.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276919578},{"amount":30.45,"local_amount":132.87,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T18:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":144.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283197597},{"amount":31.45,"local_amount":137.24,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:46:39Z","rounded_local_amount":149.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287197264},{"amount":32.48,"local_amount":141.75,"processed_date":"2012-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-08-15T10:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":154.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":294397318},{"amount":68.22,"local_amount":297.67,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:52:48Z","rounded_local_amount":324.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301452161}],"funded_date":"2011-12-15T19:27:07Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:52:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":378302,"name":"Valentine","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Valentine is 27 years old.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

She is married with 4 children. Nine years ago, Ehtibor began selling shoes in the market, since her husband\u2019s income was not enough to cover her children\u2019s expenses. That was how she got a taste for the business and was convinced that it left her sufficient revenue. Currently, she works in this business full-time, and thanks to her enthusiasm, she has made a name for herself in the market. However, her clients request more and more things each day, which is why Ehtibor is requesting a loan of 2000 Somoni, which she is willing to repay in a 7-month term. With this money, Ehtibor will be able to purchase more goods and therefore give her business a boost. With your help, Ehtibor will be able to help her children prosper so that they may one day go to college.  <P>\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International<P>\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

you.\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":325025,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To

Los ahorros que hab\u00eda guardado Marcelina durante 10 a\u00f1os, por fin tienen sus frutos, puesto que con ellos pudo comprar el bus que tanto ansiaba, el cual ahora a brinda el servicio de transporte de pasajeros Juliaca \u2013 Moho (Distrito de Puno). Gracias a esto, sus ganancias han mejorado, ya que anteriormente su \u00fanica fuente de ingresos era su restaurante, el cual sigue adelante progresando poco a poco. Lo que m\u00e1s le gusta a Marcelina de su nuevo trabajo como cobradora del bus, es que le permite viajar constantemente y disfrutar del paisaje, lleva reci\u00e9n 6 meses en esta actividad y lo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil es tener que madrugar para cumplir con los horarios de salida. Sabe que es duro, pero que a la larga le dar\u00e1 muy buenos resultados, espera que en el futuro pueda comprar otro bus y salir adelante m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido. Este es su segundo pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, sabe que tiene que cumplir con todas sus cuotas a tiempo, si no quiere causarle problemas a las socias de su banco comunal, en el cual es muy querida por la alegr\u00eda que demuestra. Con los mil nuevos soles solicitados, comprar\u00e1 un televisor nuevo para el bus, para que los pasajeros puedan distraerse durante el viaje.","en":"Marcelina is 33 years old and a loving and caring mother. She lives in her own house with her 45-year-old husband Mariano and her two children, Yesenia (14) and Rolando (3), who are the inspiration for all their efforts. The savings Marcelina has accrued over the past 10 years have finally paid off, now that they can purchase the bus that they have always longed to buy, which now provides transportation service to passengers from Juliaca to Moho (in the Puno district). Thanks to this, their earnings have increased, since their only previous source of income was their restaurant, which has been growing little by little. What Marcelina enjoys most from her new job as a bus conductor is that it lets her travel constantly and enjoy the trip. She has spent 6 months at this job and the most difficult aspect for her is waking up early to follow the bus schedule. She knows this job is hard work, but will bring her good results in the long run. She hopes to buy another bus in the future and move forward even faster.\r\n\r\nThis is Marcelina's second loan with MFP. She knows that she has to make her payments on time so as not to cause problems for the other members of her loan group.

She makes hand-made crafts that she sells in her own general store.  She began these activities based on her own creativity and self-taught skills in the area and the marketplace.\n\nRosa is a very intelligent woman who takes full advantage of all her knowledge.  She is always making items according to the season, the market and their profitability.  She adapts quickly to product changes when necessary because she is able to adjust to market requirements.  This is what happened previously when she used to make ceramic items but sales became complicated due to high competition.  She was able to stay in business learning different manual skills and techniques like the ones she practices today making rag dolls and cloth crafts in her own workshop.  She has a machine to manufacture them and a sales point in her own home which she uses quite efficiently in that she added other merchandise like female articles, decorative figures, kitchen decorations, home goods, multiple-use clothing items that also generate profits.\n\nThis is her second loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo that will be used to buy raw materials and ingredients like: fabric, faces, cotton filling and Christmas decorations for the December sales season.  She used her first loan to increase working capital and acquired new customers.  She wants to use her Kiva loan to continue growing especially to reach her dream and great challenge of having a large store specializing in her own products.\n

She has already received and successfully repaid 1 loan from Patan BPW. She used her most recent loan to buy grocery goods for her shop. In the future, Ranjana plans to lift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the small grocery stores, called pasals, are an important part of the local economy. Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home. Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margins. By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability. While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce and shrewd businesswomen. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Her potential clients are people around the market area.

Her husband is a businessman who helps provide for the family's basic needs. Nadzuwa has a house with neither electricity nor piped water.

He has been a farmer his whole life in this area, where rice is the primary crop. Angel has livestock on his farm as a secondary source of income. He raises chicken and grows many different fruits for personal consumption and small sales. He hopes that with this loan he will be able to more efficiently plant rice and involve his 3 children in the activities. They are all almost done with school and are interested in taking part in the family business. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Angel is part of the first Communal Bank in the new Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All the members of the Resistencia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named Resistencia. They will use the microloans to prepare the land and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Resistencia Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming, plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural area in the Province of Guayas which is known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture, which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to rice farming and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year during the rainy season on the coast of Ecuador. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There is not a single financial institution that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The only access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous area despte its rural location. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in the fact that many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding during the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worst when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the rice farmers lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p> "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":15477,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Prepare his farm for cultivating rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.166667 -79.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-02-17T18:05:20Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Angel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-07T23:54:29Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-04-25T14:53:49Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T23:27:58Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13836},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-02T18:37:45Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T23:27:58Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":19608},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-27T13:54:53Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T23:27:58Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":26599},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-26T22:17:45Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T23:27:58Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35706},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-28T23:25:46Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T23:27:58Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":47471},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-09-27T16:15:24Z","settlement_date":"2007-09-27T23:27:58Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":59563}],"funded_date":"2007-02-21T23:54:29Z","paid_date":"2007-09-27T16:15:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":8685,"name":"Mubariz","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mubariz is a local resident of the town of Beylagan.

She started her business with the first credit she received from Manuela Ramos as a member of the Communal Bank \"Mujeres Trabajadoras\" (hard-working women).  She received 300 nuevos soles from them (about $100) five years ago.  She used to devote herself to housework and helping her husband on their small farm.  With this money, she bought cuajada (a yogurt-like product) and took it to Trujillo to sell.  This is how she started a grocery store little by little in her community.  She still takes cuajada to Trujillo on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  This loan from Manuela Ramos of 1,200 nuevos soles (about $403), to be repaid in 4 months, will be used to buy rice, sugar, noodles, canned goods, and other products to supply her grocery store.  Her main goal is to see her children become professionals.  <p><b>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva volunteer<\/b><\/p>\r\nLa se\u00f1ora Carmen Rosa tiene 32 a\u00f1os, ella vive en Cruz de Pargo, Caser\u00edo del Distrito de Salpo, Provincia de Otuzco.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance.

Her bakery is located in the center of the market, which gives people an opportunity to buy fresh bread at any time of the day. The development of this business would help Muborak to sustain her family. With the price of flour increasing, she decided to buy flour wholesale. This would allow her keeping the same prices.

Rice sells for an especially good price now which, in turn, generates a good income that allows Viviana to contribute to family expenses, including her children's schooling which is especially important to her.\r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan of S\/.800 (800 Peruvian soles), to be repaid in 6 months, she will buy sacks of rice, at wholesale prices, to resell to shops and market vendors.  She already has customers who come by her house daily looking for her product.\r\n<p>\r\nViviana, 25, lives with her husband and their two young children.  She operates this business because she likes it and because it generates income that helps her husband with the family's expenses.  Her goal is to own a small rice farm.

She owns & operates a business venture, catching & selling farm-raised fish .  She has 4 years of experience in this business.    Foai needs a loan of WST $2700 to purchase a fishing boat.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 550 talas or US $229 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Foai joined SPBD to gain access to financial services.  Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks, because they lack collateral.  This is Foai's 4th loan with SPBD. \r\n\r\nIn addition, SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"3 out of 3\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"2 out of 3\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"1 out of 3\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nFoai's Overall Social Metric Score:*               1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.

She owns a business venture, catching & selling ocean-caught fish .  Eseta has 5 years of experience in this business.  Eseta needs a loan of WST $2000 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nEseta joined SPBD.  This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Eseta's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Eseta M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.4 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.8 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\"\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He started this business 7 years ago with a small number of livestock, but as his business has developed, he has acquired greater quantities of animals for their eventual sale and gain from their derivatives. According to Jangiboy, he works very hard so that he can take care of his children. For that reason, he is always looking for a way to improve his family's living. Currently, he needs a loan of 6000 Somoni in order to purchase more cattle to later resell after breeding them. This will allow him to fully meet the needs of his family and educate his children.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have 2 small children, and all live together in their own cozy home that they built through much sacrifice.  Ricardo's dedication and industriousness have made him one of the best producers of bananas and coffee in the Sanchirio Palomar area.  In spite of being young, he is a responsible father and this motivates him to continue working so that he can provide the best for his family.  At times he is helped out by his wife, especially during the harvest season.  Normally, he works in the fields and his wife carries out the domestic tasks and cares for their children.  For more than a year he has worked in agriculture, and what he likes most is to cultivate and clear his coffee lands.  On the other hand, he does not enjoy the market in his city where they want to haggle on price, where the wholesalers claim that their price is the real market price.  In spite of all of this, he considers this line of work to be sufficiently profitable, since he can cover the household expenses, educate his children and, above all, save.  Currently he has 2 hectares of bananas, and he wants to buy 2 more hectares of land so that he can add to his cultivations and have increased production.  This is the first time that he has taken a loan from MFP, and he is enthusiastic about the idea of working with a communal group where there are rules and regulations to comply with.  With the loan he requests, he will buy 1,600 banana plants to plant on his new land.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":551138,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"he will buy 1,600 banana plants to plant on his new land","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-10T22:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ricardo ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":375,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1068.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588206}],"funded_date":"2010-06-12T15:08:38Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":210291,"name":"Victoria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Victoria, de 28 a\u00f1os es una madre de familia muy responsable y trabajadora, vive en su casa propia junto a su esposo Samuel de 29 a\u00f1os y su \u00fanico hijo Yonatan de 10 a\u00f1os.
