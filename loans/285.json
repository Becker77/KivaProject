She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Sapi has 3 years of experience in this business.  Sapi needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or US $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Sapi joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Sapi's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Sapi T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.8 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

With these different types of dishes, Florence will hopefully earn more profits which in turn will allow her to keep reinvesting for better financial stability and continue building a secure future for her family.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":628690,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"the purchase of various dishes for sale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":"Kigali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.953611 30.060556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":117,"posted_date":"2010-10-30T14:10:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Florence","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2010-12-27T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:50:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182623159},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:56:01Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188760980},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:58:15Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191497904},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:26:28Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195926193},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:21:21Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201368100},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:54:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206233106},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:08:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211308392},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:59:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216587296},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:36:04Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221756483},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:32:25Z","rounded_local_amount":50575,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227124836}],"funded_date":"2010-10-30T15:34:57Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T10:32:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":247580,"name":"Teofilo Alfredo","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Te\u00f3filo de 43 a\u00f1os, vive en una zona periurbana llamada Para\u00edso de la flor ubicada en una zona caracterizada por sus caminos de tierra y monta\u00f1as.

She buys the maize from the farmers and sell it in town. \r\n\r\nShe works at her business for 12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Lusajo currently earns about $200 USD each month from her business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":288043,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more maize in bulk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-03-16T03:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":625,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lusajo M.

This is 27-year-old Agness M. from Mbeya. She is married with one 7-year-old child. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting one orphaned dependent. \r\n\r\nAgness has been running a beauty salon business since 2002. Her business is the place where her friends and fellow women can gather and literally let their hair down.  Most beauty salons in Tanzania are places where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own.\r\n\r\nShe works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, six days per week and is assisted by one employee. Agness currently earns about 90 USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to expand her salon. In the future, she plans to open another salon. Agness thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

Her husband\u2019s salary is being saved for the education of their child and for their future as a whole family.\r\n\r\nGina engaged herself in her retailing business hoping to help her husband in gaining income to support their daily needs. Gina wants to ask for a loan of PHP 5,000 to further expand her business. She\u2019s always wanted to grow it with her own ability. Her future plan for the loan is to purchase additional products like rice to sell to increase her

She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Christina has 1 year of experience in this business.  Christina needs a loan of WST $1000 to buy flour, flavoring, sugar, and plastic bags.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Christina joined SPBD.  This is her 1st loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Christina's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Christina T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Jovelyn is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Jovelyn joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Jovelyn is requesting a first loan of 4,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business.

Sohibjon is 41 years old, married, and has two children. He sells cattle and, as a rule, purchases small cattle in the central market, feeds them, and than resells them at higher prices in the local market. Having been in this business for ten years, Sohibjon knows very well how to choose the animals, breed them and look after them. He gets up early every morning in order to feed the animals and look after them. His knowledge and skills allow him to make his business successful and generate a stable and considerable income for his large family. Sohibjon has a large and friendly family who are always trying to help each other.\r\n<br>Today, knowing that prices for animals are not so high now, but will increase for sure, Sohibjon is planning to enlarge his stock and purchase cattle. With this purpose in mind, he is requesting $1000 USD. You could become an important part of Sohibjon's family's life. He deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving him.      \r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan<\/b><br>\r\nTajikistan, a key post on the Silk Road, is perhaps best known for its rich history. It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<br>However, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Zoila sale a repartir el pan con los diferentes clientes los cuales la consideran una persona muy trabajadora y responsable quien siempre entrega sus pedidos a tiempo, por lo que muchas personas la prefieren. Zoila solicita un pr\u00e9stamo a Integral, por medio del cual pueda contar con el dinero necesario para invertir en el negocio comprando toda la materia prima necesaria para la elaboraci\u00f3n del pan, tales como harina, levadura, az\u00facar y otros m\u00e1s, as\u00ed mismo poder comprar mayor cantidad de le\u00f1a para obtenerla a precios m\u00e1s bajos. La panader\u00eda para Zoila ha resultado ser un negocio muy factible, el cual no solo le permite salir adelante como persona sino tambi\u00e9n salir adelante con su hogar.","en":"Zoila is 48 years old and lives in Santa Mar\u00eda, located in the Usult\u00e1n department.  She lives with her husband who works.  Zoila has a bakery in her home, where she and two other people bake bread in a wood fired artesian oven.  This attracts many people because this method of baking is very uncommon now.\r\n\r\nZoila delivers the bread to different customers who consider her to be a hard working and responsible person.  Many people prefer to buy from her because she always delivers on time.  She is asking for this loan through Integral in order to invest in her business and buy ingredients and supplies such as flour, yeast, sugar, etc.  She would also like to buy a large quantity of firewood in order to be able to buy at lower prices.  They bakery has proven to be a successful business, not only allowing her to get ahead as a person, but also within her home.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nWhether on the streets of Kathmandu or in the villages outside of the capital, tea shops are places of business and meeting in Nepal.  Called a chiya pasal, these tea shops make a sweet, milky tea that can be purchased for a few cents a cup.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to keep their store shelves stocked while increasing their profit margins by buying in greater volume. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women.

y tambi\u00e9n de queso.  Desde hace 30 a\u00f1os, su madre viaj\u00f3 a Venezuela, pa\u00eds fronterizo con Colombia, y le dej\u00f3 una tienda en la que Myriam puso su primera venta de avena y pan, posteriormente cambi\u00f3 esta actividad por la de fabricaci\u00f3n de fritos, actividad que ha conservado durante sus cambios de residencia y con la cual ha logrado salir adelante con su familia.  Myriam sabe hacer de todo un poco en el \u00e1rea de culinaria, porque tambi\u00e9n ha tenido negocio de restaurante, e ha ido bien pero cuando se tiene que mudar empieza nuevamente la venta de fritos.  En esta actividad la ayuda su hermana, distribuyen en tiendas y  a la comunidad de su barrio al detalle. Sus compras las hace de contado en peque\u00f1as cantidades y su sue\u00f1o de crecimiento, est\u00e1 basado en adecuar una buena infraestructura para mostrar sus productos y ofrecer un ambiente confortable a sus clientes.  Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con el cual comprar\u00e1  una vitrina,  un peso para pesar el queso, mesas y sillas para agregar almuerzos, como un nuevo producto que \u00faltimamente ha pedido su mercado, pues conocen la saz\u00f3n con que en este negocio se cocina. Su sue\u00f1o m\u00e1s adelante es tener su casa propia y sobre todo crecer como empresaria y como negociante, teniendo el capital de trabajo suficiente para mantener a su clientela como  a ella le gusta: satisfecha.","en":"Myriam, 56, is an enterprising woman and mother of a 21-year-old son.  She lives in the city of Barranquilla and works making fried fast food items, cakes, \u2018hayacas\u2019 [type of tamale] and other products derived from wheat flour; she also sells soft-drinks and cheese.  \r\n\r\nThirty years ago her mother moved to Venezuela, a country bordering Colombia, and left Myriam a store where she started her first business selling oatmeal and bread.  She later changed this business for the one making fried fast food items, an activity she\u2019s kept throughout her changes in residence and with which she\u2019s managed to get ahead with her family.  \r\n\r\nMyriam knows how to do a little of everything related to cooking because she\u2019s also owned a restaurant.  She\u2019s done well but every time she has to move she falls back on making fried fast food.  Her sister helps her in this activity; they sell to local stores and to her neighborhood community at retail.  She buys in small amounts and pays cash and her dream for growth is based on installing improved infrastructure to display her products and provide a comfortable environment for her customers.  \r\n\r\nThis is the reason she\u2019s calling on Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to request her first Kiva loan to buy a display case, a scale to weigh the cheese and tables and chairs to start serving lunches as a new product her market is asking for because they know the tasty way she cooks.  Her dream for later on is to own her house and, above, all, to grow as a businesswoman and merchant having sufficient working capital to keep her customers the way she likes to:

She is a retired clinical officer and an active member of Konguini Jisaidie. The group has been working with WEEC for the last four years. Since she joined the group for years ago, she has borrowed four loans and paid very well. \r\nSusan started her business in 2003; she sells new clothes which she buys from Nairobi and some from Tanzania such as Vitenge.

Today Mahmud is thinking about expanding his business, because his current earnings are not enough to provide for his family. He wants to purchase more calves and fodder.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, Tajikistan is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture, and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only 7 percent of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve ittheirs agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients have the opportunity to support themselves through viable businesses. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives with her husband and two children, who are 14 and 18 years old.  Her children are students and her husband works as a taxi driver, which is exhausting work.  Sometimes things don\u2019t go well and he has to drive all over the city looking for customers so he can earn money to take home to his family.  Celia has a general store which she opened with money that her husband gave her so she could support them when he was unemployed.  This is the second loan that she has requested and she will use the loan to invest in the purchase of various products to stock her store and increase sales.  She hopes that this will help the store a great deal, as well as help her get ahead in her personal life and keep supporting her children\u2019s education.

Her husband is a farmer and a fisherman. The family resides in a beautiful village in front of Cuyo East Pass facing the South China Sea, on the island of Panay, Philippines. She buys and resells fish and vegetables to support the needs of the family. She applied for this loan to buy farm supplies such as seed, fertilizer, and insecticides, and to get additional capital for fish vending. Balbina wants to purchase these items in advance so as to get a lower price, because when she buys during planting season the cost is much higher. She hopes that in the future she can save their harvest for their own consumption rather than sell the harvest to finance their next

They are currently in school. She is a petty trader who trades in garlic and ginger. Apart from being used to spice up food, garlic and ginger have medicinal properties. They are used in preparation of local herbal mixtures in the treatment of malaria and other common ailments. <P>\r\n\r\nBeatrice has been a retailer of ginger and garlic for the past two years and has since been very resourceful to her family. She wants to use the loan to buy a bulk supply of garlic and ginger to serve her customers throughout the season, especially in the face of increasing food prices due to the current food crisis in the country.

She lives, together with her family, a couple of blocks away from the city's garbage dump area, popularly known as Payatas. Under and around the foot of the gigantic mountain of garbage live Philippines' poorest urban residents, the scavengers. Lorna has four kids, two of whom are in college. Her eldest already graduated from college, all thanks to her rice business. \r\n\r\nLhor owns one of the only three government rice-distribution stores in Payatas. She regularly receives two rice deliveries per week. Each delivery gives her 20 sacks (50 kilos each) of government rice, which she pays for upon delivery. She then repacks the rice and sells it to the community for PHP18.00 per kilo, half the price of other commercial rice. The delivery, repacking and selling all lasts but a day after delivery. The business earns an income of PHP20,000.00 per month.\r\n\r\nLhor considers the business not only as a blessing to her family, but most importantly to her community. More than 300 residents, some of them scavengers from around Payatas, line up every week to get their weekly ration of rice. The line can go as far as 100 meters from the front of Lhor's store. She says she wants to upgrade her order of 40 sacks a week to 70, because more and more families are not able to buy their ration because Lhor's supply runs out every time for them. Dealers like Lorna are chosen by the Social Welfare Department as authorized distributors to poor communities.\r\n\r\nLhor has never missed a savings or loan payment for all her six years of borrowing. Her previous loan was for PHP30,000. She is now borrowing her 13th loan from the Center for Community Transformation (CCT).\r\n\r\nCCT is a Filipino family-oriented and Bible-centered development organization that provides and creates equal business opportunities for small-scale Filipino entrepreneurs through loans and social interventions."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":346485,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Expand

Emerita has been engaged in her business for more than eight years and earns approximately 2,000 Philippine pesos a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Emerita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Emerita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI, a Kiva partner. This previous loan was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell in the future. \r\n\r\nEmerita is requesting a new loan of 5,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. This will be the ninth loan taken out by Emerita from ASKI.

Nelly is very well known and respected in her neighborhood, as every Saturday and Sunday she goes to town to buy the products she will then sell in her shop: she is the only one supplying the area which is very far away from the town.

She began her business by selling door-to-door and now has a stall, choosing dresses for customers. Working six days a week and 10 hours a day, she earns about 1,500,000 Sierra Leone leones (Le) every month from this business. \r\n\r\nShe would like a loan in the amount of Le 5,000,000. Fatmata has already received and successfully repaid two loans, and now requires a new loan in order to improve the stock, buying trimmings, linens, ribbons and zippers. She hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately Le 300,000. In the future, Fatmata plans to own a shop with a door rather than a stall.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \n \n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1618037,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"to construct a warehouse.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1825,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marie Chantal\t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2014-05-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":1236906,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":3,"loan_amount":1825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1236906}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cindy Etchison","image":null}},{"id":945,"name":"Elsy","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"<p>Elsy is a 40-year-old married mother of two. She is a very active woman and has been an entrepreneur since she was very young. In fact, Elsy sold clothes through college so she could afford to go to school. When she got married, her father-in-law sold goods in the towns, and he taught her a lot about sales. With over twenty years of experience in this business, Ms. T. has found her niche. Her husband helps her operate the business when he can, but he has his own job in a factory. On his days off, he is responsible for purchasing the clothing material and negotiating the prices with the suppliers. Both Elsy and her husband know the business very well, and they are constantly trying to think of ways to improve it. Their strength has allowed them to grow since first starting. Elsy wants to apply for credit so that she can offer other varieties of products, taking advantage of the frequent celebrations that the town throws. She envisions colorful garments for the party-goers as well as continuing the line of clothes she currently sells.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<br \/>\r\nMifex offers our clients microinsurance and access to business training and educational programs.

In the future, she plans to open another business.  Sesilia thanks you for your support!<p>\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":216155,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional crops and commodities for her grocery store.

Christine is married to an accountant at the Kenyatta National Hospital. They have 3 children, 2 of whom are currently attending school. \r\n \r\nChristine runs a posho mill (a machine that grinds maize into flour) in Achuth, which she started in 2001. On a daily basis, Christine raises between 300-400 KSH. There is stiff competition in the area, as there are other posho mills around. \r\n \r\nIn 2003, Christine started a second small business selling household items to the local community.

In addition to singing she also sells small items at the markets in her town.  This is her first loan with MFP and she has decided to become a member of her community bank.  The loan money will go towards the purchase of a new dress, since the public\u2019s acceptance has a lot to do with the image she puts forth. The dress is valued at 1,000 soles because it has embroidery and other intricate details.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rachel Crouch, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":276764,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Musical Performance","sector":"Entertainment","themes":null,"use":"Purchase a new dress for performances","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-24T20:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miriam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1064.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640565}],"funded_date":"2009-02-25T02:31:32Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:18:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rachel Crouch","image":59003}},{"id":95177,"name":"Rehema V.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo (Greetings) from Tanzania!

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of microleasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Raising kuku is a popular micro-business in Tanzania, especially amongst SELFINA clients, for a number of reasons. One of the many reasons is that they require little start-up capital. You can start with one or two, and either add to them as you go, or wait for them to multiply naturally! Another reason is that they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. \r\n\r\nJennifer works at the business for 4 hours per day, 6 days per week and is assisted by her two young sisters. She currently earns about 700USD a month from her business. She is requesting a loan in order to buy feed for her chickens. In the future, she plans to increase the quantity and the range of her business.

Ever since she learned the trade of seamstress, she began receiving large orders for embroidery, decorations, sewing clothes, etc.  This helped her improve her income.  Goya works out of her house in an area where she set up her small sewing workshop.  She buys the materials she uses wholesale to make a larger number of clothing articles.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\t\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous, and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He uses a walkie-talkie to help him facilitate his work and pick-up passengers a lot faster. \r\n\r\nSergei has been in this business for 8 years. His determination to succeed has helped him keep his business stable and sustainable and has promoted its expansion. Sergei has paid back all the loans that he ever borrowed from \u201cNadiya Ukraine.\u201d Currently, his daily income is about US$30-40, and he would like to take out a short-term seasonal loan to be repaid within two months. With the help of the money, Sergei would be able to do some repair work on his vehicle and, in the future, remodeling of his apartment. Sergei's modesty, diligence and responsibility so far have helped him develop his venture and gain a good reputation among other taxi drivers, and it will also help him promptly repay the current loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":174697,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Car maintenance","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Ivano-Frankivsk","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"48.884167 24.686111","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2008-06-26T16:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sergei","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-10T18:48:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2008-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":275},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":275}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":275,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2008-08-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T04:57:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1270.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":282536},{"amount":275,"local_amount":1250,"processed_date":"2008-09-01T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-09T02:06:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1270.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":312613}],"funded_date":"2008-06-26T18:48:00Z","paid_date":"2008-09-09T02:06:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":58310,"name":"Channeary","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Channeary T., of Yok Bath Village in Kandal Province, is a 47-year-old widow with six children, one of whom is a tailor while another is employed in a garment factory.

Joyce thanks you for her support!\r\nABOUT SELFINA!\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":346602,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Florentina is requesting a new loan of 15,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This loan will be the ninth loan taken out by Florentina from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. About ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisher folks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1425,"image":{"id":444871,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

She is 64 years old. Lydia is married and has three adult children. To make a living, Lydia owns and operates a manufacturing business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from manufacturing and selling products to local businesses and community members. Lydia has been engaged in her business for more than eight years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\n\nIn 2008, Lydia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lydia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 15,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to  purchase raw materials to manufacture additional products. Lydia is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP, which will be used to  purchase raw materials to manufacture new products and to pay for the labor cost. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Lydia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \n\nAbout GDMPC:\n\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has seven branches covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.
