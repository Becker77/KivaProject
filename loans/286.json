Married to Faustino Iglesia, a carpenter, they are blessed with two children who are now working. She makes sure that she helps her husband by managing their own variety store. Aside from managing a store, Yolanda also has a food stand where she sells breakfast and other food viands. She has been in the variety store business for 16 years.\r\n\r\nYolanda has been a member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than five years now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow ten times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  The reason why she has been consistent in paying her dues is because she used almost all the money she borrowed as added capital for business purposes.  Her business now lets her earn a profit of PHP 5,200 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 10,000 loan. This amount will be mostly used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying more food and basic commodities like assorted snacks and beverages for her store.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that she can save enough money so that she can fix her house and finance her grandchildren's college education someday. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":453625,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy more food and basic commodities like assorted snacks and beverages for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-01-01T08:01:00Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolanda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":90,"local_amount":4000.02,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:06:08Z","rounded_local_amount":4196.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118055444},{"amount":15,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:06:21Z","rounded_local_amount":699.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118055445},{"amount":15,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:06:31Z","rounded_local_amount":699.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118055446},{"amount":15,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:06:43Z","rounded_local_amount":699.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118055447},{"amount":15,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:33:54Z","rounded_local_amount":699.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123890144},{"amount":15,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:34:07Z","rounded_local_amount":699.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123890145},{"amount":15,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:34:20Z","rounded_local_amount":699.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123890146},{"amount":15,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T09:34:31Z","rounded_local_amount":699.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123890147},{"amount":15,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":699.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128923880},{"amount":15,"local_amount":666.62,"processed_date":"2010-03-08T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T08:37:34Z","rounded_local_amount":699.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128923881}],"funded_date":"2010-01-01T14:04:14Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T08:37:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Susan Sharfman","image":562243}},{"id":168846,"name":"Donato Mareano","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. C.

The members of the group selected this name because they consider themselves to be extremely hardworking women who want to succeed and move forward so that they can provide a better future for their families.\r\n<p>\r\nThe description will focus on Sra. Francisca Felisa N. G., one of the members of this group of women entrepreneurs who want to excel.  She is 61 years old and has been a widow since she was 40.  Francisca has two children. Miguel is 27 years old and works to help his mother with the household expenses.  Jes\u00fas is 23 years old and studying for a law degree while his brother and mother support him.  Francisca earns a living by making embroidered blouses and gowns, as well as candles.  The loan she will receive will be used to buy more fabric, thread, and other materials needed to continue making these traditional garments.\r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Francisca says she decided to pursue this business activity because she learned the skills from her mother when she was eleven years old.  She started this business 30 years ago.  Since the death of her husband, she needed to find a way for her children to get ahead.  Francisca is very pleased with the results of her business.  She has had great success with the number of customers she has gained and it continue to grow since she travels to different states in the republic, where she sells traditional clothing along with her fellow group members.  \r\n<p>\r\nSra. Francisca says that neither she nor the other members have failed to make their loan payments.  These women are hardworking, responsible, prompt, and trustworthy.  Over time they have gotten to know one another since are from the same community.  This is not their first loan with FRAC.  In fact, they have taken several of them and have not had any problems.  \r\n<p>\r\nFrancisca is extremely grateful for the support and the trust that Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad and Kiva lenders have given to her and her fellow group members.  She is thankful that they will be able to get ahead in their businesses and help their families improve their quality of life.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Francisca dreams of being able to support her children.  She wants to help her younger son finish his degree so that he can find a good job and not have to suffer like his brother by having to work in the fields, work at jobs with low pay, or go through stretches of time when no work is available.  She also wants to either build or buy a store where she can sell traditional clothing so that she does not have to travel in order to generate better income.\r\n<p>\r\nThe members of this group and their business activities are as follows:\r\nSof\u00eda G.

This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 21,000 to buy more goods to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Rosalia is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

Together with her husband, she sells women's clothing in the central market. Mashhura has been in this business for 10 years. Mashhura's business is constantly growing. Two of the advantages she has in the competitive market are affordable prices and regular additions to her inventory. Her little vending kiosks are very popular in the marketplace where she works. Mashhura realizes that lending services are very helpful to her business, as loans allow her to increase her turnover capital and expand her business. She would like to make it easier for women to find comfortable and good quality clothing, which is why she is requesting a loan of 9,500 Somoni. One of Mashhura's further plans is to continue expanding her trade and eventually generate enough profit to finish remodeling her house and improve her family's living standards. \n  \n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Moreover, Pelipus also needs money to live in Irian Jaya. \r\n\r\nKristina has been running a kiosk business for eight years with her own capital, but the business is not developed well due to the limited capital that she has. \r\n\r\nKristina intends to add stock for daily needs in her kiosk such as instant noodles, snacks, coffees, sugar, etc. Kristina is hoping that TLM is willing to help her by providing a loan.

She has been doing this for 21 years and she considers the most difficult thing about her job  to be working with laborers in different fields with different crops.  For this reason she needs money so she can improve her crops.  Now, over time, she wants to buy new land so she can increase her production.  She knows that she will be able to achieve this as she is a hard-working, capable woman.  \r\n\r\nShe belongs to the communal bank \"Alianza al progreso\" and this is her fourth loan with MFP.

In the morning, she is at home, but at 10:00 she has to graze her bulls, which serve to plow the land, or to help her husband on the farm. She comes from a farming family. Because of this, she has always worked on agriculture. What she likes most is to raise animals, like cows and bulls, because they are very useful for sowing and when she sells her products, they carry a considerable amount of weight. It is difficult that the price of fertilizer has increased. In earlier years, it didn\u2019t cost very much and she could sow without difficulty. Now, it costs 215 soles per sack, while it was 85 soles before; it is large difference. Because of this, sometimes she doesn\u2019t want to sow, but if she doesn\u2019t sow, she won\u2019t have the means to live. The goal of her effort is to continue acquiring tools for her home and later, to have her own house.

She lives in a polygamous family with her husband, co-wives, and their children in the Darsalam district of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of Mali).  She very quickly dropped out of school to work in commerce with her mother, who used to sell peanuts.  After several years at her mother\u2019s side, she was able to master commerce and eventually advance on her own.  She started by selling beauty products but decided in the end to get situated in the making and selling of local soaps.  This has been her work for three years, and she enjoys a large customer base and a reputation surpassing the confines of her district where she lives.  \r\n<p>\r\nTo make soap, she needs 10 kg of caustic soda plus 5 kg of iodized salt.  Then she mixes the elements with the aid of a large ladle for an hour until a soapy paste is obtained.  Once it is cooled and dried (over a few hours), it is formed into balls to be sold.  \r\n<p>\r\nWanting to perpetuate her business, she has turned towards Soro Yiriwaso, with which she has been associated for 42 months.  After five solidarity loans and one individual loan, she is now on her second individual loan in the amount of 400,000 francs CFA.  She intends to use it to obtain an empty barrel, two bath tubs, and 40 kg of caustic soda.  Supplies of raw materials are gotten locally, and sales are made at the retail level to customers composed primarily of women, cash or credit accepted.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe intends to realize a monthly profit of 80,000 francs CFA that will enable her to cover certain family expenses, especially those of the children.  Her ambition is to sell shoes concurrently.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

is the mother of two children. She attended school until the death of her father, who was the bread winner in the family, made her stop her education. With the frustration in her life, she became pregnant and was rejected from her family. She has been a very hard-working woman. With no husband, she was unable to cater for the children and had to relinquish her children to the care of her parents.\r\n\r\nWith her hard working spirit, she was introduced to GHAPE by one of her friends. She is gifted in planting and her very first loan was used to buy mesh for planting and seedlings for farming. She wants to use this loan to continue planting, and to buy seedlings and feed. With the profit from the loan, she plans to educate her children, buy a plot of land, and provide basics needs for the family.\r\n\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

Negros Occidental. She earns her living by selling food and herbal products.\r\n\r\nWilma\u2019s 45-year-old husband, Ronnie, is a farmer. They have 10 children who are between 5 and 22 years old. Four of the children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores. The other six children work to help the family.\r\n\r\nWilma joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 with the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of their family's life. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by selling food and herbal products. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nWilma is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 was used to fund operations of her business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her twentieth cycle loan, PHP 15,000, which she intends to use for her business of selling food and herbal products. Wilma is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":525255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

de Manta (Manta Port) on the Ecuadorean coast, lies the community bank, Umi\u00f1a, in an area of the same name. A member of the community bank, Viviana, 27 years old, lives here with her husband, 28 years, and two children. The couple has been married for 11 years. They had made their lives originally in the capital of Quito where they worked in a food outlet. However, once their work contract expired, they were left with nothing, and decided to return to their native town of Manta to see what work they could find. \n\nAfter a serious discussion with her husband, Viviana and her husband decided to set up their own food stand using their modest savings to invest in the business. Viviana\u2019s husband bought a cart and elaborately adapted it to suit the needs of the business. Viviana put her cooking skills into practice. The couple sought permission from the council in order to station their cart in an area three houses away from where they both lived, and once permission had been granted, Viviana and her husband began working and have continued to do so for the past two years. \n\nEach day, the couple has to move their cart from their house to a car park (parking lot), where the council has granted them permission to run their business and which is three blocks away in a busy area of the city. The food cart offers typical regional fare. \n\nThe loan will be used to buy food and a tent to protect them from the rain. Their strong sales will help them repay their loan installments on time. Viviana tells us that she started her business with just $70 and now she continues investing more and more. Though they took an initial risk in setting up the business, they have never regretted the decision.     \n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Justine Raymond, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":534033,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy provisions and an awning for their business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Manta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-05-06T16:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Viviana Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":550,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:02Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709128},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:52Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892427},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632787},{"amount":137.5,"local_amount":137.5,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:58Z","rounded_local_amount":137.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846821}],"funded_date":"2010-05-06T18:26:22Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Justine Raymond","image":null}},{"id":202211,"name":"Nusrat's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nusrat, a resident of the mid-sized city Vehari, Pakistan, is the wife of M.

She is 31 years old. Leonora is married and has 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Leonora owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting rice for sale. She hopes to have good health for her so she could keep up with the hard work required at maintaining their farm. She says she only wants the best for her family.\r\n\r\nLeonora joined CEVI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Leonora is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional seeds, seedlings, and young crops to raise. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Leonora from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to make improvements to their house.\r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years.

","en":"This communal bank is called Citlali and it is located in the community of Hueyapan, T\u00e9tela del Volc\u00e1n, in the state of Morelos, Mexico.  It has six members who know each other and are neighbors.  Reyna A. R. will use her loan to purchase boxes of soft drinks, Pepsi, and candy by the bag and by the kilo to stock her business.  Mrs Adela B. R. will use her loan to purchase napkins, thread,  yarn and blouses to sell.  Mrs Altagracia Jim\u00e9nez C. will purchase flowers wholesale ('nubes', 'polares', 'casinos', 'palmas' and 'clavelins' - all types of flower) to stock her business.  Mrs Josefina P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez will purchase fabric to embroider, thread, wool etc.  As well as making napkins, Mrs Margarita T. Arag\u00f3n will purchase live chickens to raise and sell whole and by the kilo.  Mrs Emelia A. F. will purchase oils, formulas, tea and tablets to stock and sell.  The members of the group would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad \u201cthank you for helping us with the loans. We are very happy that you are giving us a hand and we are thereby able to achieve our goals\u201d.\r\n\r\nMrs Margarita T. Arag\u00f3n is a member of the Citlali group.  She is 26 years old and studied up to the third year of high school.  She has her diploma.  She has one daughter called Litzy Paloma who is 7 years old and is attending elementary school.  She is requesting her loan to purchase thread and cochineal and indigo dyes.  She makes handicrafts; 'rebosos' (a type of scarf), 'ma\u00f1anitas' (a type of shawl), jackets, backpacks, caps, scarves and cell phone cases.  Her business is called \u201cartesan\u00edas de Hueyapan\u201d (Hueyapan handicrafts).  It is a group of craftspeople from San Felipe.  She joined the group 2 years ago.  She learned because her mother taught her to make garments with a backstrap loom and she was interested in selling them.  The first 'reboso' (scarf) which she made was with thread which her mother gave her as a present.  She sold the scarf and bought more thread and saw that the sale worked.  Her business is in her home in San Bartolo, Hueyapan and it has helped her to pay for food and cover her household expenses.  She also has a business in the city center in a market where she sells chickens in parts or whole.  Her husband helps her with the chicken sales and also helps her in her handicraft business as he knows how to make handicrafts.  She considers her business to be important because it enables her to support herself.  The aspect of her work she likes the most is when the garments are finished because they are pretty and if not she pulls them out and starts again..  Her business gives her a lot of pride as does creating handicrafts, above all because her mother showed her how.  She remembers when she sold her first scarf she was suffering hardship and it got her out of a difficult situation.  Her customers are tourists and students who buy her backpacks.  The challenges which she faces are the high cost of thread and the cochineal and indigo dyes, as well as the competition as there are other people who make handicrafts.  Some of her business profits go towards food and some is re-invested in purchasing material in Santa Ana, Puebla.\r\n\r\nMargarita is planning to expand her business and buy more products of the same type but wholesale.  Her dreams are to have more sales and to have a well-known and well-stocked handicrafts store.  She hopes to achieve this by means of her loan and putting a lot of effort into her work.

He has been a farmer for the past eight years, having learned rice farming from his parents. \r\n\r\nHe will use this Kiva loan to support labor costs during rice production: nursery, transplanting, field management, guarding birds, and finally in harvesting activities. \r\n\r\nWith profits from his farming he wishes to invest in his business so that in the future he can acquire machines and tractors that will enhance his farming capacity. \r\n\r\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). \r\n\r\nDespite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1175,"image":{"id":853768,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To support labor costs during rice production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":"2011-08-25T21:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1175,"lender_count":43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Theogene","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":700000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":700000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1175,"local_amount":700000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T11:17:49Z","rounded_local_amount":704412.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270148670}],"funded_date":"2011-08-26T09:43:26Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T11:17:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"David Walker","image":null}},{"id":333347,"name":"Rudik","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rudik requested credit for the expansion of a family-owned pig farm. \r\n\r\nRudik is 45 years old, married, and lives with his family in the village of Shaumiani, East Georgia.

The school does not currently have access to consistent clean drinking water and therefore has to spend a considerable portion of its budget on firewood, which is used to boil water for the children. Installing a water filtration system will therefore save the school money in the long-term as the cost of firewood will be reduced. The loan will enable the school to purchase a UV water treatment system with a 450 litre tank, which will be big enough to store clean drinking water for the students every day. \n\nVictoria Primary School will repay their loan from their school fees, which they collect each term.

She has always had a facility for sales.  Her ability to influence people and her strong charisma are her best assets in attracting customers, who are pleased with the products and Maritza\u2019s service.  She has earned her living selling natural products for six years, during which time business has grown little by little, providing Maritza with nice profits.  The hardest part of her work is making the sale, since some people are very skeptical about the advantages of natural products, but Maritza\u2019s power of persuasion is much stronger, allowing her to overcome this small difficulty.  This will be her eighth loan with Microfinanzas Prisma, and she has been very punctual with her payments.

During the day, he works as a taxi driver transporting passengers from the city to different rural villages throughout the province.  At most he is able to make two round trips in a single day.  Occasionally, if he is lucky, he will secure passengers for the return trip into the city and earn more money as a result.  On the days he is not driving, Wilmer works in his coffee and baN. fields as a means of boosting his finances so that he can cover his daughter\u2019s expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the harvest season, Wilmer makes good use of his taxi.  While carrying passengers, he can also accommodate 3 to 4 bags of produce to take with him into the city to sell at the market or to various coffee traders.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis is Wilmer\u2019s first loan with MFP.  His brother invited him to join the Communal Bank, so Wilmer promises to make his payments on time to keep from making him look bad.  He will use the funds to buy chemical fertilizers for his coffee crop.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":425698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-15T08:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wilmer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2010-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:16Z","rounded_local_amount":1004.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886547}],"funded_date":"2009-11-20T11:31:41Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":156491,"name":"Zinaida","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zinaida runs a small business in one of the local stores in Novomoskovsk, next to the central city market, selling children\u2019s clothing items.

They live together in a populated neighborhood located to the north of the city.  A year ago, she decided to sell different products, specifically shoes and sneakers.  At first it was not easy, because her customers were used to buying products from the home from her.  But later they started buying the shoes that she offered, because they realized that they were of good quality.  Now she buys a variety of shoes, offering her customers the best prices and the ability to buy on credit.  As a result, the business is profitable and this allows her to cover her household expenses without a problem.  She states that she does not like it when her customers are slow to repay her; this delays her ability to buy a greater quantity of shoes.  But since she is a very enterprising woman, she plans in the future to expand the merchandise that she offers.  She wants to set up a small store in some market close to the place where she lives.  This is her second loan with MFP, and she pledges that she will make her payments on time.  She appreciates of all of the people who made this loan possible that will allow her to continue to work and seek progress.

They have three children and live in their own home in the community of Santa Rosa Alta in the ecological District of Sivia.  Amador is a man of good principles and a hard worker with a stable future.  He works in order to have a peaceful retirement without any financial worries.  For a very young age, Amador has engaged in farm work, helping his parents with the field labor.  As part of his inheritance, he acquired a small parcel of land on which he now plants and grows cacao.  Since acquiring his own land, Amador works alone.  In the future, he hopes to acquire another piece of land so that he can build a nursery for growing and grafting cacao plants which he hopes will increase production.  For this reason, Amador has returned to MFP to request a loan so that he can complete his desired wish.\r\n<p>\r\nThis will be his second loan with MFP and he promises to submit his payments on time.  The loan of 3000 PEN that he requested will be used to build a nursery for grafting cacao.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":822683,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to build a nursery for grafting cacao.

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

You can start with one or two and either add to them as you go or wait for them to multiply naturally! Secondly, they require little space, so sometimes you can just let them run around in your garden or compound. Thirdly, while they are growing they produce eggs, which can either be sold to provide a supplementary source of income or eaten to provide a supplementary source of protein.

Now, Carmen wishes to apply for a loan from ASHI amounting to Php 7,000 to be used in the same kind of business. Given a chance to receive the bigger loan, the volume of commodities she will sell will be increased and she can help many people from their village have access to commodities with less effort and time consumed.\r\n\r\nDespite her age, Carmen wants to maximize her remaining strength and capacity in her business so as to have savings. In this way, she can obtain the security of tenure she wishes for herself when she grows very old. As a single, old woman, she believes that there will be nobody to take care of her nor shelter her when she becomes very old unless she has money. \r\n\r\nCarmen, though, is very positive that she

She lives in the Ciudadela 20 de Julio neighborhood in the city of Baranquilla. She works in general merchandise and she has three children: 30, 28 and 19 years old. She has been a client of the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo for 20 years and she has received 29 credits during that time. They have really changed her lifestyle, including the education goals of her children. This one that she is asking for now is to pay for her younger daughter's 5th semester.  \r\n\r\nShe grew up with her parents and her twelve siblings in the Nueva Esperanza neighborhood. Since she was twelve, she has been working selling childrens' dresses and other merchandise. She would pay her monthly tuition and help support her family with the profits she obtained. Suffering from domestic trauma, she had to leave her high school studies halfway through and begin to work as a store employee. Gradually, she gained the confidence of her bosses and without any schooling in it became the manager of this business. She left this ten years later. With her severance package she bought the home she still lives in with her three children. They are her reason for being and it is they who drive her to work and make an effort every day to get them ahead.   \r\n\r\nLuz Marina, with the motto \"I never look back, only ahead\", is a fighter who has been separated for the last 17 years. Her business card is an independent, honest and responsible job with which she has been able to give her three children professional educations. She has been supported with education loans for her family. These are only given to good clients at the Fundacion Mario Santo Domingo. This organization has given her financing to strengthen her business of merchandise sales, which she distributes throughout Baranquilla. She states that her business is the sale of shoes, clothing, appliances, gold and silver jewelry, miscelaneous and paper products. It has been going for 30 years and its smooth operation is the product of her experience acquired as a store employee and from entering the loan program at the Fundacion, which has lent her money to increase her working capital. This has meant prosperity for her and has allowed her to finish many of her projects and goals. One of these is to watch her youngest daughter become a professional. This is why she is aplying for a loan in the amount of $1.575.532. Another goal is to have her own locale in the center of town. All of her life she has been in the business of various merchandise and she wants to continue growing. \r\n\r\nWith her years of experience as a business person, she says that \"It's not all profit.\" Her clients buy her merchandise on credit and at times she has had to lose with some clients. This is why she takes references into account and she wants her clients to be employed. Her dream is for her daughter to finish college and her goal is to have a locale in downtown Baranquilla.        \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":475756,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Shoe Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Her daughter's college education ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-01-30T14:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Marina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":1575532,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":254484},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":256100},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":260368},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":264707},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":269119},{"due_date":"2010-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":270754}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":129.22},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":130.04},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":132.2},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":134.41},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.65},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":129.22,"local_amount":254484,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:32Z","rounded_local_amount":257300.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123913413},{"amount":130.04,"local_amount":256100,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:01:13Z","rounded_local_amount":258934.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128949027},{"amount":132.2,"local_amount":260368,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:33:02Z","rounded_local_amount":263249.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136677817},{"amount":134.41,"local_amount":264707,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:58Z","rounded_local_amount":267636.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144712191},{"amount":136.65,"local_amount":269119,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:36Z","rounded_local_amount":272097.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151895697},{"amount":137.48,"local_amount":270754,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":273750.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159636021}],"funded_date":"2010-01-30T16:32:27Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:12:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}},{"id":177315,"name":"Merilyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Merilyn is a rice farmer from Banga, South Cotabato.

Married to Rodolph Ahouassa, S\u00e9raphine is the mother of three children, all in school, of whom two are currently in her care. The couple provide for the family together. S\u00e9raphine never attended school. For 35 years, she has run a business selling cereals (beans, rice, maize, etc.) at her store located in Agla. As a secondary activity, S\u00e9raphine also sells charcoal. Her business provides her with an income that she uses to meet her various needs and those of her family. S\u00e9raphine gets her supplies at Dantokpa, the international market in Benin.

By working hard in her vegetables vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable.  She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4,500. Lourdes is borrowing PHP 10,000 to purchase more vegetables to sell. This will be her 12th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 9,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Lourdes aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He produces rice and corn on land given to him by his father, who, he still helps and work with. He lives with his girlfriend, who he hopes to marry and start a family with in the near future. He will invest the loan so he can plant for the next cycle by preparing the land, and buying fertilizer and seeds. He does not have children but is still very family oriented, as he is close to his mother, father and brothers. He hopes he can fix the lands so they can be productive for years to come.  <\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>This borrower is part of the newest and largest Communal Bank in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector. <\/p>\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p>\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p>\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4>\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by big large companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans, as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Rice Farming <\/h4>\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plough the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. Because people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4>\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are no drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of products including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many of the loans will also go towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":30427,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Rice and Corn Farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Baba","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.783333 -79.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-04-18T23:41:55Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jacinto","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-03T21:28:36Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:15:52Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:47:42Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21439},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-13T22:39:37Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:47:42Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31816},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-07T19:32:55Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:47:42Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":51902},{"amount":912,"local_amount":912,"processed_date":"2008-01-03T22:20:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T22:47:42Z","rounded_local_amount":912,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":107783}],"funded_date":"2007-04-19T21:28:36Z","paid_date":"2008-01-03T22:20:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":12941,"name":"Nguyen Thi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs N. is 47 years and has 4 sons and one daughter ages 27-18.

To buy her merchandise, she used to go to AZOVE in the Mono but wasn't able to create a large enough inventory due to her limited means.  She then came to obtain an initial loan of 50,000 francs CFA to grow her capital.  From there, she added to her business the sale of condiments, since after the initial loan, her operating capital increased.  With the experience she acquired with regards to commerce, and because of growing demands from customers, she is presently requesting a third loan of 100,000 francs.  With these funds, she is thinking of again diversifying her business by buying, in Lom\u00e9 in Togo, children's clothing for distribution, which is also going to enable her to find other types of customers.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva volunteer<b><p>\r\n\r\nA.

She is 64 years old and has been a member of the Yoff credit union since March 2001. She already benefited from three previous loans. She is married without children but keeps busy selling French fries, fruit juice and custard. She also has a sewing activity. She counts a little over two years of experience. Untimely power cuts are the main reason for her discontinuing her sewing activity and redirecting all her efforts towards selling juice and fries. Therefore she is requesting a 200,000 francs loan to build up a stock of the ingredients she uses to make her products (potatoes, powdered milk, sugar). Her objective is to maximize profits to fulfill her personal needs and also to initiate future projects; this is all in order to improve her family's living conditions.\n\nMadame Malmouna is pictured

She has made a living for the past four years selling groceries out of a small convenience store installed in her home. The business started out of the necessity to find an activity to generate income to solve personal expenses and support her family, whose finances depend on agriculture, which isn't permanent income. At her small business, she offers all kinds of snacks and drinks to her customer. This is very useful to her neighbors since the area is located a little ways outside of the city. She prefers to buy products in small quantities and always travels to the city of Chiclayo to stock her business with fresh products. The business has been well-received, and she wishes to expand it by purchasing a wider variety of groceries. For this, she has requested for the first time from Kiva partner Edpyme Alternativa a loan of 1500 soles to achieve her objective.

Many years ago, he lived in the city of Urubamba, where he had a hardware store. He had to close it because there was a lot of competition and he did not have many customers. \r\n\r\nDetermined to start a new life, Oscar moved to Ollantaytambo, where he had some friends and distant family members who encouraged him to open a store. He used the money from the liquidation of his hardware store to open a new store in the city of Ollantaytambo, where he sells paint, cement, nails, metal sheets, sandpaper, and much more. He has operated this business for ten years, and it is going very well for him, thanks to the dedication he puts into the business. With the benefits he obtains from his work, he has helped his three children get ahead. \r\n\r\nOscar is a responsible and hard-working father who presents an image of experience and professionalism. A regular flow of customers visits his store, but his sales are low in the month of March, due to the rains that fall in the city.

She and her husband, a pensioner, have a small dairy business. They have had to work hard their entire lives, mostly in low-skilled, physically exhausting jobs. They dreamed of having a dairy farm of their own and living peacefully, watching after the livestock and drinking fresh milk. \r\n\r\n<p>Ten years ago, the couple's dream showed the first signs of becoming a reality. They saved sizable funds and bought their first dairy cow. This purchase was very overwhelming and meaningful for Bermet\u2019s belief and motivation. Now the business has several heads of cattle and generates a profit of 2,000 KGS monthly and up to 3-4 liters of milk daily, which is further sold for 11 KGS per liter. It\u2019s been ten years since the start of the business, and the couple helped organize a nice wedding ceremony for their daughter. Bermet's short term goals include purchasing 2 sheep in order to diversify the household. Bermet believes in Kiva lenders\u2019 assistance to reach this goal. Bermet's long-term goal and big wish is to build a big shed for her cattle. \r\n\r\n         --- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance (MBF), a young, ambitious and socially-focused microfinance institution in Kyrgyzstan. \r\nMBF is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development and upholds the triple bottom line \u2013 People (building human capital and taking care of its customers as well as society), Planet (keeping environmentally friendly) and Profit (earning revenue to expand autonomously).

Today, BRAC has emerged as an independent, virtually self-financed paradigm in sustainable human development. It is one of the largest Southern development organizations employing over 100,000 people, 61% of which are women, and working with the twin objectives of poverty alleviation and empowerment of the poor. Diagnosing poverty in human terms and recognizing its multifaceted nature, BRAC approaches poverty alleviation with a holistic approach.\r\n<br><br>The successes of BRAC in the international development arena have stimulated a series of discussions, both with African delegations, who have visited BRAC programs, and with donors who work in Asia and Africa. Both the African countries and the donors have encouraged BRAC to join the development campaign in Africa to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and more recently to join the campaign of \u201cending poverty\u201d, which is an area where Africa represents the greatest global challenge.\r\n<br><br> In Uganda, BRAC registered as a Non Government Organization (NGO) in January 2006 to undertake programs in Education, Health, Water & Sanitation, Agriculture & Livestock and Microfinance. The Microfinance and Education are the pioneer programs launched in Uganda and, as of July 2007, had served 21,273 borrowers and enrolled 1,155 adolescents in its education

Six of her eight children are in school, and she and her husband have to work where there are opportunities to make some money. She gets up very early to make breakfast for her kids and also makes lunch before she heads off to her farmland with her husband. She doesn't work exclusively on her own land, but also also works as a day laborer on other people's crops. She cultivates passion fruit and coffee, but this time she also wants to include caigua, a regional plant that will take only four months to produce with high margins, especially in the summer. Lola is very pleased with her business. When she isn't in the fields, she takes her products to the local markets. Meanwhile her husband (holding the box of beer in the photo) stays at home selling soft drinks, sandwiches and beer.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<\/em>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.
