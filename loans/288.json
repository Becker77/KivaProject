Policarpio's job is in agriculture; he grows pinneapples and coca leaves and owns a total of 5 hectacres. His parents taught him to till the land and he grew up hoping to some day own his own farm. Now with the savings he has accumulated he was been able to make those dreams of owning his own parcel of land a reality. He knows the hard labor of farm work well having done this work for 20 years. During harvest time he hires temporary workers to transport his prodcuts to different markets. He is very dedicated to his job because thanks to his every day labors he is able to see his plants bear fruit. He asserts that he does not like the winter because during these months the insects are abundant and this negatively affects his crop yields. The loan that he is applying for will be used to buy a cargo motorcycle to quickly deliver his products to the markets. With time he hopes to buy more land and vary his crops more thus providing economic stability for his family. This will be his sixth loan with MFP, and he has been very punctual with the payments from his previous loans and plans to continue this practice. At his community bank he is well liked by the other members. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":728320,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Vehicle","sector":"Personal Use","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a motorcycle to transport his produce to the market.

She is 46 years old and has been widowed for eleven years.  Macedonia is a hardworking woman who struggles to provide the best for her six daughters.  They live together in their own home in the city of Quimbiri.  She began her adventure as a farmer from a young age, working on the land of her parents.  Her passion for farming led her to acquire her own land which she purchased with the help of her late husband.  Macedonia has worked her parcel of land for 25 years and to this day continues to grow cacao and coffee.  During the harvest season, she has the help of workers who are in charge of quickly picking the fruit of each crop in order to complete their work in less time.  Macedonia is very committed to her work because her efforts have resulted in the fruits that her plants have produced.  She generates good earnings for each kilogram of product that she sells.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe loan she is requesting will be used to acquire cacao plants to add to her fields and to take advantage of the shortened harvest season.  At the moment, her greatest priority is to acquire additional farmland so that she can expand her plantings and increase production.  This is her fifth loan with MFP and she is willing to complete all of her payments on time.  Macedonia wants to be able to access additional loans in the future.  She is a well-respected member of her Communal Bank.

In the San Fernando neighborhood in the city of Cartagena, everyone knows her through her business of selling a variety of merchandise to workers, individuals, housewives, youth, and most especially women, who are her main customers. Sofia caters to them because they are faithful. Her business consists of selling on credit so people can pay her when and where it is possible for them. She is currently getting ready to fill some customers' orders for Fathers' Day, and her working capital is not sufficient for satisfying all the demand. This is why she is realizing that she needs to invest more capital in her business to bring in more customers, and so she has decided to request a Kiva loan. This is the second loan that she will receive from Kiva partner Fundaci\u00f2n Mario Sato Domingo. It will be for purchasing men's shoes and clothing because these are the items that are on order and that have helped form her success. She knows the market very well and knows that this is an opportunity for impacting her sales. Sofia lives with her husband and five-year-old son. She dreams of offering her son a better quality of life every day so he can become a professional with opportunities to be successful.

Her salon is open from 8am to 7pm.  She learned this trade by being a hair salon employee for two years.  In addition to selling beauty products and services, she sells some basic necessities.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<P>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is starting a business venture, selling fabric handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Menime needs a loan of WST $1000 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\n\nIn 2010, Menime joined SPBD.    This is her 1st loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Menime's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\n\nThe following social metrics for Menime K. are provided by SPBD*:\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.7 out of 3\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.4 out of 3\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.3 out of 3\n\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \n\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\n\nAbout  SPBD \nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \n\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She's a widow and she lives with her 3 daughters in her own house. For more than 10 years she's been a weaver, an activity which she does in her home with the help of her daughter. The sweaters that she makes are very high quality, which is why she has loyal and stable customers who solicit her elaborate work on a regular basis. Sabina doesn't stop at weaving. She's always on the lookout for new business opportunities like, for example, selling breakfast foods in front of a university, which supplements her income. She's so enthusiastic about her work that her greatest desire in this business is to produce a greater quantity of woven wool garments. For this purpose she wants to buy a loom.

The group is comprised of 13 hardworking women.  All 13 are married.  They have their families and are housewives, but they are also involved in raising animals such as pigs, sheep, chickens, and turkeys.   They do this to obtain income and to help when they can with expenses, whether for their children in school or the needs of the household.  Also, because they don\u2019t have full time jobs they want to invest part of their time in something that is productive and that supports their husbands so that together they can progress, getting all the necessities of life that they currently need.\r\n<p>\r\nThe community of San Pedro is one of the most advanced communities in the municipality.  It has all the public services, like water and drains, a hospital, schools, and a service station.  In short, it is very complete and is also a community that has a lot of professionals and young students.  The group decided on the name Altamirano because it is a name which can bring a lot of luck to all its members since it is the name of a part of Chiapas and also of an important writer.

His wife abandoned the family recently and he's been left alone to raise their 2 children: Guillermo Kevin and Victor.  They live in the town of Alianza.  Despite the problems he faces, Guillermo is working hard to make a better life for his children and he's proof that hard work pays off.  He recently harvested a bumper crop of cacao, coffee, avocados, oranges and other citrus fruits, all of good quality.  Harvesting his crop is what he likes best about farming because he can collect on his hard work.  Guillermo has farmed for 21 years.  The hardest thing about it, he says, is having to do most of the work himself and, consequently, he hires temporary labor to help him.  He owns his farm, but he would like to buy more land so that he can increase his production and, in turn, his earnings.

Santos is married, and is the father of 4 children; his eldest daughter is in secondary school, and three youngest are in primary school. With the income that his business generates he is able to take care of some household expenses and financial commitments. The loan that he is requesting is to purchase wood, which is the principal material used the in production of furniture. Because it is rainy season, it is difficult to acquire dry wood, this causes Santos to be unable to attend to his clientele, and consequently leads to a loss of time and income. He also counts on a mill where he offers milling services for nixtamalized corn, coffee, corn for flour, Nicaraguan tamales known as Nacatamales, and donut rings. Santos is well known in his neighborhood for being a helpful man with dreams of getting ahead of life. He mentioned to us that he will be very grateful for the loan that will be granted, and that he will in this way be able to get his household ahead in life. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":325815,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cedar, mahogany, laurel, and pine wood.

She lives in a monogamous family with her children and her husband in Sanoubougou I, one of the working-class neighborhoods of the city of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).\r\n<p>\r\nSince social reasons prevented her from attending school, she became initiated at a very young age to the activity of a merchant of fanci-style pagnes (a colorful West African wax cloth), basins, embroidered cloths, shoes, etc. That was more than twenty years ago. Her customers particularly appreciate the high quality of her products.\r\n<p>\r\nFaced with the wish to better satisfy her ever increasing clientele, Mariam decided five years ago to join the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. She got several solidarity loans with the association of women in her neighborhood (Benkadi Sanoubougou I Group). This is her sixth individual loan and all her previous loans have been repaid on schedule.\r\n<p>\r\nMariam will use her new loan to buy 15 wax pagnes, 15 embroidered suits, 10 fanci pagnes and 20 pairs of shoes from wholesalers in Sikasso and in Bobo-Dioulasso (Burkina Faso). She has a stall at the bus station in Sikasso where she sells her goods, cash and credit, to a clientele made up mostly of women and particularly to travelers and carriers.\r\n<p>\r\nThanks to this loan Mariam expects to make a monthly profit of 100,000 CFA francs (US$227) which she will mostly use to buy new inventory, provide for her family, pay the interest of her loan and reinvest the remains in her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robert Mouris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":800,"image":{"id":405906,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy pagnes, embroidered cloths and shoes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-10-19T17:50:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":800,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-08T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":35000},{"due_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":35000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2009-11-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:56:24Z","rounded_local_amount":35279.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103873758},{"amount":80,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:03:05Z","rounded_local_amount":35279.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110763479},{"amount":80,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2010-01-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:36:07Z","rounded_local_amount":35279.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118152295},{"amount":80,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2010-02-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:18:32Z","rounded_local_amount":35279.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123991149},{"amount":80,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2010-03-07T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:59:49Z","rounded_local_amount":35279.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129021416},{"amount":80,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2010-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:14:55Z","rounded_local_amount":35279.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136746219},{"amount":80,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2010-05-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:14Z","rounded_local_amount":35279.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144778817},{"amount":80,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:16:28Z","rounded_local_amount":35279.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961077},{"amount":80,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:22Z","rounded_local_amount":35279.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699277},{"amount":80,"local_amount":35000,"processed_date":"2010-08-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:02Z","rounded_local_amount":35279.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913236}],"funded_date":"2009-10-20T00:16:39Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Robert Mouris","image":538858}},{"id":148377,"name":"Asuncion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asuncion B. is from the village of Senote.

However, Son S. does not have enough farm supplies to use on her field. Son S. is therefore asking for capital to use toward purchasing fertilizers, seeds for growing and some groceries to resell to generate more profit.

When she learned how to produce these beautiful crafts, she decided to start her own business.  With the little bit of extra money that she earns, Margarita is able to help her husband with the household expenses.  She makes bags, blouses, skirts, napkins, dresses, belts, and embroidered waistcoats.  Margarita sells these products in her community to her friends and neighbors.    \r\n<p>\r\nShe needs this loan to invest in the purchase of ribbons, paints, thread, and fabrics for making her crafts so that she can sell them to her customers.  Do\u00f1a Margarita hopes that this loan will help her business prosper.  In the future, she wants to have a small shop where she can sell her products and teach classes to women who want to learn.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":791199,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Crafts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase ribbons, paints, thread, and fabrics.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2011-06-24T22:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-09-29T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:12:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2529.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216512780},{"amount":170,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-19T07:48:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2023.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":222223434},{"amount":170,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-16T08:10:38Z","rounded_local_amount":2023.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227201711},{"amount":212.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:12:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2529.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232807301},{"amount":85,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1011.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238618425}],"funded_date":"2011-06-25T15:48:50Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:22:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":313025,"name":"Kuntura","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kuntura is 27 years old .

She has a domestic partner and three children: one 28 year old daughter who is a seamstress, one 23 year old son who is self-employed and one 15 year old son who recently\r\nfinished his third year of high school. Her life partner works in trucking. Sabina's wish is to advance her business and start a shop and provide the right conditions because their house is very small. Due to circumstances, she has converted her house into a seamstress shop and, as a result, she is not able to unwind from her work. Her friend, Candida, has offered support so that she can get ahead with her business. Her other wishes are to maintain an open hand of friendship like Fundacion Leon 2000 that continues to finance her commercial needs so that she can overcome the difficult situation of progressing in her work.<p>\r\n\r\nHer economic activity is seamstress work such as making uniforms, dresses, and women's and men's trousers. She has had this business for ten years. She started it working with another person, but later, she decided to sell in the Chinandega market. Then with her earnings, she decided to buy a machine with which she could fulfill orders for uniforms. This loan will be used as working capital to buy raw materials like fabric, thread and zippers for different orders that her customers make. She says that she is thankful for the funding and the different organizations that facilitate this type of loan assistance.<p>\r\n\r\nCandida Eufemia M. T. is 51 years old. She has a domestic partner and six children. Her daughters are 32, 30 and 17 years old and her sons are 22, 28 and 25 years old. Her life partner does not work. Among her goals are to establish a store in her home and to start a stronger and more productive business. In this manner she can maintain the credit available with Fundacion Leon 2000 and capitalize on economic activity. Her other goals are to provide better earnings for her family since she has not achieved her goals due to the current economic state of the country. Her desires are to give her daughter a future so that later she can pursue her studies and have a successful career.<p>\r\n\r\nCandida has worked for twenty years selling products that were shipped like maize, jicama seed and peanuts. She began her business through the interest in entering this type of business since she was searching for a way to support her family.

With the money that he is requesting he will purchase more merchandise to stock his stand.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mariela Cedeno, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":325842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-30T02:50:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Agust\u00edn","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":63.82},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":66.8},{"due_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":71.22},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":73.21},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":77.73},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":80.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":84.84},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":87.92},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":92.01},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":97.68},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":100.83},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":103.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":22.34},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":23.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":24.93},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.62},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":27.21},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":28.08},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.69},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":30.77},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.2},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.19},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.29},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.3}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":22.34,"local_amount":63.82,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:40:17Z","rounded_local_amount":67.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990638},{"amount":23.38,"local_amount":66.8,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:10Z","rounded_local_amount":70.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211749},{"amount":24.93,"local_amount":71.22,"processed_date":"2009-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:22:21Z","rounded_local_amount":75.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641275},{"amount":25.62,"local_amount":73.21,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:35:36Z","rounded_local_amount":77.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080713},{"amount":27.21,"local_amount":77.73,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:05:22Z","rounded_local_amount":82.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996854},{"amount":28.08,"local_amount":80.23,"processed_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:24Z","rounded_local_amount":84.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842199},{"amount":151.55,"local_amount":433.01,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:06:09Z","rounded_local_amount":458.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733863},{"amount":10.59,"local_amount":30.27,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:20Z","rounded_local_amount":32.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717152},{"amount":36.3,"local_amount":103.71,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:26Z","rounded_local_amount":109.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144750967}],"funded_date":"2009-05-31T21:11:25Z","paid_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mariela Cede\u00f1o","image":883126}},{"id":115509,"name":"Gaudensia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Tanzania!

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. <P>\r\n\r\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

They are hairdressers, mechanics, contractors, drivers and builders. Some sell products such as food, clothes for women and shirts for men. Within the business field there is a lot of competition, especially in the sale of clothes, where there exists a wide range of products for all tastes. The members working in this line of business operate sales stands at the entrance to the market hall, and so one might say that they are \"well-positioned\" to generate enough income to recover their capital and earn profits to support their families. This loan will be used for the acquisition of new merchandise for the holiday season and new year as well as the acquisition of tools of the trade that contribute to the generation of better profit for the service providers.

In  the vicinity there are interesting archaeological ruins and the city itself retains remarkable baroque buildings from the colonial era, such as the convent of Carmen, among other tourist attractions the city owns.  On this occasion we can see in the photograph the members with some of their children who accompany them to the meetings of the communal bank.  \r\n\r\nGloria, 32, was married a number of years ago, and conceived 4 children, the second of whom died in an accident at the age of 11.  Of the other children the oldest is 15 years old, and as he does not like to study he remains in the home.  Another is 11 and studies in a local school, and the youngest, who is 3, stays with her.  They do not yet have their own home, so they live in a rented home in the center of the city.\r\n\r\nThis member has a good friendship with all the other members of the small bank, and she joined the group thanks to her sister who already belonged to the bank.  Now the group is in its 2nd loan cycle.  She delivers colas, potato chips, Cheetos, yucca chips, and everything from the Frito Lay and Pepsi brands along with her husband, who drives his own truck.  They have been in this line of work for 10 years.  With the new loan they will pay expenses related to the maintenance of the vehicle, such as expenses for oil changes, tires, and other maintenance.  Her dream is to eventually come to own her own house.\r\n\r\nFlor Ch\u00e1vez, 19, is one of the youngest members of the bank.  She lives in the center of the city of Cuenca and she lives in a common-law marriage with her partner who works in a car dealership.  She is in her 6th month of pregnancy, and they do not have their own home so they rent. \r\n\r\nFlor sells clothing door to door.  She does not have a fixed schedule and she works each day without resting even one day.  She tells us that she started with the business thanks to the first loan that she took from the Fundaci\u00f3n ESPOIR.  She also tells us that thanks to her mother-in-law and brother-in-law she is now a member of this beautiful group of enterprising and go-getting women.  Now that the group is in its second cycle she will take a loan to buy pants, blouses, shirts, bags, underwear, socks, etc. for the whole family.  Her goal is to grow her business and at some point have her own home.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":516727,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to pay for expenses related to vehicle maintenance such as oil change, tires; to acquire pants, shirts, blouses, bags, underwear, and socks ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-03-30T03:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2475,"lender_count":69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Carmen Brecilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariana De Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Mayra Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esther Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flor Beatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zoila Aurora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Gloria Elida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karina Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Emilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Eugenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2475,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-30T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-04-27T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":309.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.38},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":309.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":928.14,"local_amount":928.14,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:34Z","rounded_local_amount":928.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674828},{"amount":309.38,"local_amount":309.38,"processed_date":"2010-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:40Z","rounded_local_amount":309.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709008},{"amount":309.38,"local_amount":309.38,"processed_date":"2010-05-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:51Z","rounded_local_amount":309.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709009},{"amount":309.38,"local_amount":309.38,"processed_date":"2010-06-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:35Z","rounded_local_amount":309.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892305},{"amount":309.38,"local_amount":309.38,"processed_date":"2010-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:46:44Z","rounded_local_amount":309.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892306},{"amount":309.34,"local_amount":309.34,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:47Z","rounded_local_amount":309.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632680}],"funded_date":"2010-04-08T22:53:13Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":194208,"name":"Wifridah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Wifridah O.

They average 39 years of age and have an average of five children each. They all live in the Darsalam district of S\u00e9gou (fourth administrative region of Mali) and met through neighbours and marriage. This group of women trade in fodder (food for livestock), tomatoes, children's clothing and calabashes (vines which can be dried out to be used as bottles or utensils). With a view to increase their businesses, they decided to work together with Soro Yiriwaso and are on their fourth group loan. \r\n\r\nMrs. Mariam Traor\u00e9 who buys and sells decorative articles is planning to use her loan to buy 200 calabashes. She gets her supply of calabashes in Tona and Konodimini. The calabashes are peeled and engraved with small figures or designs made out materials which have been traditionally designed for this purpose. They are resold to order to newly married couples, sometimes on a door-to-door basis in the various neighborhoods, and the customer base is made up of women and men. Mrs. Mariam Traor\u00e9 hopes, along with the other members of the group, to make an average monthly profit of 27,500FCFA part of which will be invested in their businesses and part for their savings.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Alison Le Bras, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1225,"image":{"id":534908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Decorations Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase calabashes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1225,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dado       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bah           ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"T\u00e9t\u00e9    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumou   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.16},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-05-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:03:33Z","rounded_local_amount":101206.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144779292},{"amount":204.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:17:07Z","rounded_local_amount":101206.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151961508},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:01:38Z","rounded_local_amount":101206.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159699628},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:58:14Z","rounded_local_amount":101206.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166913515},{"amount":204.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:41:20Z","rounded_local_amount":101206.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172180680},{"amount":204.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:20Z","rounded_local_amount":101206.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177476648}],"funded_date":"2010-05-05T17:14:14Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T16:14:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alison Le Bras","image":608879}},{"id":202403,"name":"Sharon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sharon B., 24 years old, is from the village of Capayangan, Banisilan, South Cotabato.

 esta experiencia fue significativa en su vida y le dio la firmeza,  para iniciar su propia iniciativa de negocio que hoy lleva por nombre  llamada \u201cTienda MAFE\u201d con la cual se independiz\u00f3 a los 20 a\u00f1os y que  ha logrado estabilizar, desde antes de cumplir sus actuales 27 a\u00f1os de edad.

When he was just 12 years old, not even finishing high school yet, he started working as an employee in a store.  This experience was significant in his life in that it made him determined to start his own business which today is called \u201cTienda MAFE\u201d with which he became independent at the age of 20 and which he has managed to stabilize before his present age of 27.\r\n\r\nHe has faced several challenges in his store like when many customers who had taken items on credit didn\u2019t pay him.  However, this did not discourage him and he continued forward just being more careful about choosing customers when credit was the issue.  Now his sales on credit are very few; he sells almost his entire stock of merchandise for cash.\r\n\r\nAt one time or another he was also a victim of holdups but with help from his parents he continued toward his goal of stabilizing the business always counting on help from his sister who is his right hand.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  He will use it to buy merchandise like: foodstuffs, snacks, beverages and the usual items that go into a family\u2019s daily needs.  He will also use it to pay debts he has with his suppliers and gain the discounts offered for cash purchases.\r\n\r\nHis ideal is to own his house because he currently rents.  His greatest challenge is a lack of credit history that makes him ineligible for loans from financial institutions.  This is why he\u2019s called upon the Fundaci\u00f3n to undergo his first experience with financing;  he hopes to grow alongside it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":608531,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy stock items for his store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2010-09-28T19:00:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edwin Fernando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-03T07:00:00Z","amount":178239},{"due_date":"2010-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":186766},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":190346},{"due_date":"2011-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":193994},{"due_date":"2011-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":197712},{"due_date":"2011-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":201502},{"due_date":"2011-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":205364},{"due_date":"2011-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":209300},{"due_date":"2011-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":213311},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":223466}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":100.26},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105.06},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":107.06},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.13},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":111.21},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":113.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":115.52},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":117.73},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":119.99},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100.26,"local_amount":178239,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:09:05Z","rounded_local_amount":181389.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182550755},{"amount":105.06,"local_amount":186766,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:14:14Z","rounded_local_amount":190067.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188688363},{"amount":107.06,"local_amount":190346,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:38:54Z","rounded_local_amount":193710.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191427584},{"amount":109.13,"local_amount":193994,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-16T08:40:02Z","rounded_local_amount":197422.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196001003},{"amount":111.21,"local_amount":197712,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:09:10Z","rounded_local_amount":201206.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289010},{"amount":113.34,"local_amount":201502,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:27Z","rounded_local_amount":205063.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157164},{"amount":115.52,"local_amount":205364,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:17:55Z","rounded_local_amount":208993.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230171},{"amount":117.73,"local_amount":209300,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:30Z","rounded_local_amount":212999.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509044},{"amount":119.99,"local_amount":213311,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:00Z","rounded_local_amount":217081.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673275},{"amount":125.7,"local_amount":223466,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":227415.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227319836}],"funded_date":"2010-09-30T03:03:26Z","paid_date":"2011-09-17T08:01:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":239280,"name":"Norah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norah is 51 years old.

Over the next five years, Norah plans to have at least four good dairy cows and, if possible, to build a permanent business facility in her town.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":619518,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase a posho mill","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kisii","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-0.683333 34.766667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":156,"posted_date":"2010-10-17T16:50:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.09,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Norah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":60000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":5000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:34:21Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182576778},{"amount":125,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:18:31Z","rounded_local_amount":10062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191450350},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:57:55Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195872444},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-21T08:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202030348},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:53:47Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206668414},{"amount":125,"local_amount":10000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:23:53Z","rounded_local_amount":10062.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216535880},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T08:11:21Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221857591},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227073869},{"amount":60.41,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:31:31Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":2.09,"payment_id":232834840},{"amount":62.5,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-16T09:14:29Z","rounded_local_amount":5031.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238834242}],"funded_date":"2010-10-17T17:59:02Z","paid_date":"2011-11-16T09:14:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":243379,"name":"Namsrai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Namsrai H. is 37 years old and lives with his family in a ger (Mongolian nomadic dwelling) in the Songinohairhan District of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

She has been a private school teacher for many years and during afternoons manufactures scale models of the human body (made with putty and modeling clay attached to Tecnopor or wood) that are used for educational displays.  These might be the respiratory system or the nervous system as well as mathematical teaching aids.  She enjoys her work very much since during these two years she has acquired quite a bit of ability and manual dexterity so that she finishes her models on time with little effort.\r\n\r\nWhat motivates her to dedicate herself to this work is the good profits she earns on each project.  Because of this she\u2019d like to set up a bookstore where she can also sell this type of crafts.\r\n\r\nThis is her 12th loan with MFP and she pledges to repay on time because she wants to count on having future help that will make it possible for her to continue progressing.\r\n\r\nIf she were to get the loan she\u2019s requesting, she will invest it in purchasing acrylic paints and Tecnopor (a brand of polystyrene) in large amounts to continue making her scale models.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":699745,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Arts","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":" To buy acrylic paints and Tecnopor.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-01-24T20:40:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Doris ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":150.8},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":159.13},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":162.26},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":169.69},{"due_date":"2011-06-13T07:00:00Z","amount":175.51},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":182.61}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.55},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.85},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.64},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.81},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":56.55,"local_amount":150.8,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:40Z","rounded_local_amount":156.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195887242},{"amount":59.67,"local_amount":159.13,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:36:54Z","rounded_local_amount":165.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201327602},{"amount":60.85,"local_amount":162.26,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:33:20Z","rounded_local_amount":168.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206196138},{"amount":63.64,"local_amount":169.69,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:53Z","rounded_local_amount":176.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211269814},{"amount":65.81,"local_amount":175.51,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:57Z","rounded_local_amount":182.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549836},{"amount":68.48,"local_amount":182.61,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:44Z","rounded_local_amount":189.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718482}],"funded_date":"2011-01-24T23:09:31Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:44Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":272061,"name":"San Isidro Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The Women Entrepreneurs Committee of the City of Villa Hayes, Chaco Remancito.

She is from Bani Kenanah, an impoverished community in Irbid, Jordan, and comes from a comparatively small family of four girls. Omayma and her sisters were raised by her mother and grandmother. Omayma and her mother and sisters were abandoned by their father when they were all young so they moved into their mother\u2019s family home where they were raised by \u201ca village\u201d of extended family.  Even so, they could not escape the poverty that would not allow them to get an education. Realizing that not being educated would handicap her daughters, Omayma\u2019s mother stepped in and taught her girls how to sew and embroider women\u2019s clothing. Omayma found her passion \u2013 she loves to sew.\r\n\r\nAfter her first year of marriage, Omayma gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. Sine then, her family has grown to include two more daughters \u2013 all loved and cherished by their doting mother. Omayma has never lost her love for creating women\u2019s fashion and has established a small business from her home to enable her to work and raise her daughters at the same time.  \r\n\r\nOmayma envisions her creations long before each item takes its finA. form. She starts creating a new piece of clothing by first imagining how it will look, then drawing a picture of the dress and asking one of her friends to model while she drapes and pins the materiA. to bring her design to life. From there, Omayma sews the pieces together and finishes it with ornate embroidery. Omayma has gradually built a clientele from the members of her immediate community and she is developing a reputation for her beautiful designs that extends beyond Irbid. \r\n\r\nOmayma is requesting a loan of 400 JOD to purchase a modern sewing machine, storage boxes to organize her supplies, and hanging display racks to best display her creations.\r\n\r\nAs Omayma can imagine a new design, she can also dream big \u2013 she dreams of expanding her project throughout the Kingdom and making a name for herself. She hopes to increase her clientele and her income. Someday, Omayma would like to be able to give her daughters an opportunity to carry on the family business or feel the freedom to pursue their own dreams.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":817437,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"to

Her oldest is in school. Her husband has an electronics workshop.\r\n\r\nShe is a housewife who is also a saleswoman. She sells products from Avon and Sayson catalogs (beauty products, cosmetics, perfume and women's accessories). She works two or three hours every day, although it's hard for her to make door-to-door sales because she has to take her two youngest with her since she doesn't have anywhere to leave them. She sells items on credit and collects payments every 8 days. She has been doing this for 8 years and it's going very well. Her most popular products are perfumes and cosmetics because they're very good.\r\n\r\nShe will use this loan for perfumes, creams, cosmetics and jewelry.

is a 25-year-old who makes <i>huipiles<\/i> for her livelihood. <i>Huipiles<\/i> are wonderful handmade blouses worn by the Mayan women in the highlands of Guatemala. She will buy the hand-woven material from other women in her village and then hand embroider flowers and through out the blouse. Her technique of embroidering these fabrics is highly specialized and different from that of her neighbors \u2013 she actually apprenticed to another master embroiderer to learn the technique.\r\n<p>\r\nThe current piece she is creating incorporates 33 different Mayan symbols which are called hieroglyphs. The Maya hieroglyphics were the writing system of the pre-Columbian civilization. It will take her 15 days to create the exquisite finished blouse and  she will sell it for about US$85. She also makes a less expensive blouse that has embroidered flowers throughout the top part of the blouse and sells for about $35. \r\n<p>\r\nKelin is married and has a 3-year-old. Her husband works in the fields. Her biggest goal, which she is passionate about, is to ensure that her child must receive an education to become a professional, escaping the limited opportunities her husband endures. \r\n<p>\r\nHer health is not good and like so many other women and children in her village, she suffers from many ailments during the six-month rainy season. Malnutrition is a factor in this community. The women all breast feed and most of the children under two years old are underweight and therefore get hit the hardest with illness. Many of the women are looking for resources to obtain vitamins for their babies.\r\n\r\n<p>Here is a video of the women of Kelin's group at their loan meeting.

Makeni, a town in Northern Sierra Leone. The school serves a total of 805 students (338 boys, 467 girls) and employs 23 teachers. In operation for 12 years, it receives a small annual stipend from the government to help cover its operating costs (very few schools in Sierra Leone are funded exclusively by the government). The school reports many successes, including the fact that the external (national) exam scores for their pupils have been steadily increasing thanks in large part to the teachers' hard work. For many of the teachers here, however, life can be a struggle. The school has fallen into disrepair, and there are no funds available to build additional classrooms, repair walls, replace broken desks, or make other necessary adjustments. Furthermore, many teachers' salaries are long overdue, with some that have waited over two years to receive a paycheck. Many teachers engage in side-projects and small businesses in order to supplement (or in some cases replace) their salaries, and Khulafai's teachers are collectively seeking a loan of SLL 11 million from SMT and Kiva Lenders.<p>\r\n\r\nMomodu K. (pictured second from right, back row) is a senior teacher at the school and has taken on the role of group leader. Momodu is 46 years old and has been teaching young children for 25 years. He is married to a petty trader, and together they have eight children (three boys and five girls). Five of Momodu's children attend school and three are not yet old enough. Some time ago, he purchased a plot of land on which he dreamed of building a house for his family because he believes that \"once you own a home, you have something for which you and your family can be proud.\" He plans to use his portion of the funds to finance the purchase of some materials so that he can begin construction.

She believes that insurance is very important and necessary, because no one is completely immune from accidents on the job or in the streets.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Hugo Reyes, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":485075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Cosmetics for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Trujillo - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.115994 -79.02998","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2010-02-20T16:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Amelia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-02-02T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":216.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:29:24Z","rounded_local_amount":225.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128987611},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-02T07:55:58Z","rounded_local_amount":225.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136713640},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-26T08:09:18Z","rounded_local_amount":225.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144746687},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-27T07:48:53Z","rounded_local_amount":225.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151929844},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":216.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-28T07:53:05Z","rounded_local_amount":225.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159669013},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":216.65,"processed_date":"2010-10-01T06:59:59Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:22:20Z","rounded_local_amount":225.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172149941}],"funded_date":"2010-02-22T23:16:10Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:22:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Hugo E.

36 years old, married and has two children.  She has been partnering with our organization since 2008.  She has a secondary education.  After graduating from school, Sharafniso started working with her mother and then got married several years later.  She stayed home for a few years and took care of the children.  Then, her relative offered her a salesperson job at a store eight years ago.  After working for one year, she decided to start her own business.  Her husband supported her decision, and now she has her own business.  Sharafniso has been selling at her district market for over five years.

She has worked as a teacher at Ceta INATEC Nueva Guinea for 5 years.  She is requesting her 7th loan from Kiva partner AFODENIC so she can improve her home by repairing the floor and repairing the roof a bit, which is in bad condition.  She will buy construction materials with this loan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He will use his loan money to buy groceries such as noodles, sugar and rice with which to stock his store.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time that Javier has worked with loans from Emprender.
