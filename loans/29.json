This fact made her decide a year ago to set up on the side of their home a little candy shop and juice shop, with the intention of providing economically for her six year-old daughter. Previosuly, Rosario was just dedicated to studying. When she married her partner and gave birth to her little daughter, the responsibilities became a lot greater and she saw the obligation to postpone her managerial studies for a period, with the hope of beginning them again in the future. Today she has been able to meet both her goals by satisfactorily finishing her studies without neglecting her role as a mother, so she may now look to the future with optimism. For this reason she will continue working and managing her own business with the longing to make it grow and create her own enterprise that will generate resources for her family and a group of families in her neighborhood. Rosario wants to open a store where she sells medical materials and instruments commercially because her house is located close to a hospital, but meanwhile she will continue working in her convenient store and extending the same quality of service as always. For this purpose she needs to invest a small amount of money in her present business to cover the expenses of her young daughter's education.

She has 4 children, 2 of whom are working and the other 2 are still going to school. To be able to fulfil her children\u2019 needs for school supplies, she and her husband have to cut down on their living costs. In 1999, she talked to her husband and decided to join the TYM Fund and borrow money. At first, she used the borrowed money to breed animals. However, breeding animals did not bring her much profit while she had to spend money to buy food for them. After researching about the local\u2019s need, she decided to borrow money to invest in making tofu. This activity brought her profit. They could also feed the pigs from the remaining tofu. Their family economy becomes stable through time. Currently, her husband and children are responsible for making the tofu at home and she does the selling process.

Because they did not have enough capital to invest in the pig business, it did not yield enough income for her family. In 2005, she joined TYM to get a loan and she invested all in her pig business. She built new pig pen and expanded the operation. This has been a success. Things have changed for the better. Her family financial situation has improved a lot. She has been able to buy all the necesary goods for her household. She and her husband work hard, when they have free time they go to work for other farmers.

agricultural products in the markets of the closest towns or to traders from the same area. Her responsibilities as a mother have encouraged her to pursue farming activities to continue growing the best vegetables in the area. However, she wants to increase her investment in agriculture and expand her farmland to improve the living standards of her beloved family. Let\u2019s help this mother to keep working for the well-being of her family.\r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and for it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He now lives with one of them.  Since his childhood he has worked in agriculture.  Through this work, he was able to educate all of his children and offer well-being to his family.  But what he never could control were the occasional plagues caused by a lot of rain.  As a consequence, he told us he is sad because his potato crop has been affected.  Now his production won't be as good as he thought, so his sadness has made his normally bright eyes cloudy.  Hermenegildo will cut the leaves of his potatoes with the help of his wife to avoid losing his entire crop.  Once he harvests them, he will sell them as seeds.  He hopes to be quoted a good price so he can cover the educational expenses of his youngest son, who helps him with his agricultural work.  Hermenegildo is very responsible, not only with his payments to Microfinanzas Prisma, but also with each one of his agreements with his communal bank.  This is his seventh loan.  The money that he is requesting will go towards chemical fertilizers for his next planting of potatoes and peas.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Tanya Harper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":304958,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fertilizers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-18T23:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hermenegildo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":3000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":975}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":975,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:27Z","rounded_local_amount":3027.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118123953}],"funded_date":"2009-04-19T04:05:11Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tanya Harper","image":783083}},{"id":106388,"name":"Jesus Demarche Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The \u201cJesus Demarche\u201d or \u201cJesus is working\u201d Group is made up of fifteen male and female entrepreneurs.

She is 45 years old and lives with her husband and 3 children in their own home.  For 20 years, she has engaged in arduous farm labor along with her family.  They primarily grow potatoes, but also raise sheep and other small animals such as guinea pigs.  Every morning they allow their animals to graze during their long walks that can last for hours because of the expanse of their pastures.  Once six months have passed after the planting of their potato crops, the activities involved with the harvest begin to intensify because a lot more physical work is required.  In the meantime, Julia sells guinea pigs in response to urgent needs that arise at home.\r\n<p>\r\nIn previous years, their crops have provided variable gains.  Despite these difficulties, Julia has been able to support her family and continues to fight so that she can have better harvests.  \r\n<p>\r\nJulia is requesting her fourth loan from MFP.  Her perseverance and participation in her Communal Bank have enabled her to become recognized as one of the most supportive members of her group.  She pledges to continue with a good attitude.  The money she is requesting will be used to purchase heads of sheep and fertilizer for the next planting season.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ronan Reodica, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":374026,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizer & heads of sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-22T05:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Julia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":3500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1200,"local_amount":3500,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:32Z","rounded_local_amount":3552,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124012}],"funded_date":"2009-08-22T15:52:23Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ronan Reodica","image":498323}},{"id":135099,"name":"Borann","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Borann P., 48, is widow, lives in a small village a long National Road Number five about twenty kilometers from Phnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily-use products such as sweet candies, biscuits, and mango, in the local community. Adulfa has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 2,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Adulfa joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Adulfa has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Adulfa is requesting a new loan of 6,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Adulfa from GDMPC.

Due to all of these challenges, she made up her mind to become a GHAPE member in 2008. In this same year, she received her pioneer loan of 40,000FRS and the repayment was done promptly. With a loan of 150,0000FRS, she plans to buy palm oil, water fufu and eru (a popular Cameroonian dish) and cultivate a small yam farm. The loan repayment will start from the day the loan is disbursed. She is sure the business will succeed because she has been doing this business for a long period of time. She has a good location for that particular business. And she has a lot of customers.\r\nHer neighbors are happy her business is right beside them, because they don't have to go to the market and they can buy from her late at night. She plans to use the profit to plough back into the business, cater for her son, and give good medical attention to herself and her son.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

She lives in the community of San Antonio, a community that is part of the Cumbe region. This region is well known for its exuberant vegetation. The climate is relatively cold and the population is mostly made up of cattle farmers and agriculturists. Many of the young members of the population have emigrated in search of better work opportunities.\r\n\r\nLaura Azucena is 33 years old, she is married and she has 5 children, aged 17, 15, 14, 11 and 9. The four eldest children are in school and her youngest daughter goes to primary school in the community. Her husband is a construction worker. They have their own home because it was inherited from her parents. But her brother mortgaged the house to move to the United States. Unfortunately he never paid back the loan so their house is currently in foreclosure. \r\n\r\nLaura Azucena's occupation is raising pigs and guinea pigs. She sells them in the community and whenever she has a special requirement she washes clothes and cleans houses, but this is not a regular job. \r\n\r\nShe has been a member of the community bank for the past 6 years and she has received a great deal of support in the development of her business, and in turn she has been able to send her kids to school. This loan will be invested in the purchase of pigs. Her goal is to give her kids a better education so that they may succeed in life. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":582604,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase pigs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Cuenca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-08-13T13:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Laura Azucena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":770,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":77},{"due_date":"2010-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":77}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:13Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166847073},{"amount":155,"local_amount":154,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:07:09Z","rounded_local_amount":155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172113529},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:57:49Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407218},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:58:39Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177407219},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:29:53Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388307},{"amount":77.5,"local_amount":77,"processed_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-21T10:30:40Z","rounded_local_amount":77.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":183388308},{"amount":232.5,"local_amount":231,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:43Z","rounded_local_amount":232.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188682806}],"funded_date":"2010-08-14T16:48:28Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:10:43Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":226053,"name":"Bunthea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Bunthea M.

Eduard receives a lot of orders, but he often has to turn down potential customers because he cannot make high-quality videos with the equipment he owns at the moment.

He is hoping to make the storefront more attractive to clients by putting in a gate and also by buying a glass display case.

All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Baba Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their association works cooperatively to cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. As an association, Centro Agricola helps the farmers by providing access to machinery and training services. The farmers from Centro Agricola have received special instruction on financial responsibility and accounting from Codemicro, an organization that specializes in training programs geared towards the rural sector.  \r\n\r\n<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>The members of Centro Agricola de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others' guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola de Baba Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/em><\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana-producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large multinational companies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soybeans as secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water-intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\n\r\nBecause people do not count on formal financial finance, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soybeans. <\/p> \r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan.

S. is 39 years old, married and has three children, all of whom are in school. Gulnora makes a living selling children's clothing in the local market. She started her business eight years ago, with some help from her husband, who provided start-up funds. Gradually, Gulnora's business has expanded. Because she is hard-working and polite by nature, she has managed to obtain a devoted clientel that is happy with the goods and services she provides, and her business generates a stable income for the family. Gulnora loves her children very much and wants all of them to be well-educated. This year her daughter finished secondary school, and Gulnora wants her to enter university. To be able to do that, Gulnora has applied for a loan of $600, which she will pay back in 12 months. She will use the loan to buy additional clothing and increase the range of items she has for sale.

With this loan of 500 soles, to be repaid in 4 payments, she will invest in her current business and buy chicken, mayonnaise, and other items. \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a small market, not a portable cart. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Brittany Thatcher, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":223359,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase condiments for sandwiches","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Victor Larco, Trujillo - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-11-19T05:00:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jaqueline Maritza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2008-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T07:58:23Z","rounded_local_amount":135.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5331111},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2008-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:53:28Z","rounded_local_amount":135.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951736},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:47:59Z","rounded_local_amount":135.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224783},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T19:50:37Z","rounded_local_amount":135.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417505}],"funded_date":"2008-11-19T09:27:33Z","paid_date":"2009-03-16T19:50:37Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brittany Thatcher","image":null}},{"id":77732,"name":"Khiev","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Khiev N., 30, is a rice farmer who lives in the Batchenhchean commune in Pursat Province.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists, and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History:\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Elsa L..\r\n\r\nElsa is single. To make a living, Elsa owns and operates a business venture in the agriculture sector raising crops. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from planting and harvesting fruits and vegetables for sale. Elsa has been engaged in her business for over 6 years and earns approximately 1,500 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Elsa joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

His wife generally works with in team with him, but for the harvest season he contracts laborers, in order to more easily crop his final products, that are to be sold to the local collection centers.

The family own a small rabbit farm where they raise rabbits for sale. Muna came to FATEN and asked for a loan in order to purchase more rabbits and feed to answer the increased demand, as Al Adha feast is coming soon.\n\nMuna, her husband and one of her sons work on the farm, while the rest are school students. Muna and her husband aim to increase returns and enlarge the farm, especially because they are a big family and Gaza has a lot of farms, which increases competition.\n\nMuna's husband appears on the farm in the picture here since the conservative background Muna comes from prevents her from having her picture online.\n\nAbout Shariah-compliant lending:\n \nFATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee.

With the money that she is requesting, she will stock her beauty salon with many instruments and indispensible products to continue working. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Avni Shah, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":248597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To stock her beauty salon with necessary products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-30T04:40:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:55Z","rounded_local_amount":768.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640359}],"funded_date":"2008-12-30T05:27:06Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Avni","image":null}},{"id":85940,"name":"Carolina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Carolina es madre soltera, vive con sus dos hijos peque\u00f1os en la casa de sus abuelos.

She dedicates herself to selling snacks from a small kiosk she had built very close to a school.  She has been carrying out this activity for two years and what she enjoys is that she sells on a daily basis.  Her primary customers are the children who attend the school and pass near her location.  The business is very profitable because, even during the vacation season, the road where she is located is well-traveled.

She has a son who depends on her financial support.  Juana has a small shop where she sells books and groceries.  She started her business selling school supplies.  Two years ago she began selling wine but gave it up because it was not very profitable.  With her earnings she expanded her business to include selling groceries and was able to buy a display case and shelving for her merchandise.  She is developing her business in her home.  The first loan of 300 Sols which she received from her communal bank (Jerid Camino al \u00c9xito II Communal Bank) was used to buy groceries.  With this loan of 900 Sols, which will be repaid in six months, she intends to buy ingredients for preparing meals, school supplies and uniforms.

At the age of thirty-six, she is divorced and raises two daughters on her own. To earn her small family\u2019s living she works in a nursing home as a matron. Both of her daughters go to school, and as they grow, Jyldyz\u2019s monthly salary of $50 has begun to be insufficient to provide everything for her daughters. So Jyldyz has found herself an extra occupation, selling fruits. Her sister has been selling fruits for many years and once advised her to start doing the same. She helped Jyldyz with the first purchase and now this new activity allows Jyldyz to cover her family\u2019s living expenses. Jyldyz has decided to obtain a loan and purchase fruits in a neighboring region in larger quantities and bring them to her town to sell. This way she would be able to earn more money and make a needed repair at her house. Jyldyz is ready to do everything within her capability to provide her daughters with a good college education. In the near future she is going to open a small shop. \r\n\r\nJyldyz\u2019s partners are: Zamira, Erkingul and Taasil. Zamira, age 43, has raised four children. She is engaged in cattle breeding and her husband is an excavator operator. Her 19-year-old daughter helps Zamira keep house. Zamira needs a loan to purchase fodder and hay for the cattle.\r\n\r\nErkingul, age 26, has two children. Her husband sells flour. Before, he used to receive flour instead of a salary, which he would exchange for cattle. He would then feed and resell them. Now Erkingul is engaged in raising the cattle. Erkingul needs a loan to purchase calves and fodder for them.\r\n\r\nTaasil, age 47, has mothered six children. Most of them have left for Russia to work. Her husband works at a construction site and she bakes bread and manufactures traditional articles. Taasil needs a loan to purchase coal, as winter is approaching. \r\n======================================\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\n\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Now, people in Kirgizstan are in an avid search for a haven, where they could lead a quality life while working their dream job. \r\n\r\nAilarhon B. is the leader of this group. She\u2019s forty-five years old and she begins her day at sunrise milking the cows. It is worthy to note, that her day job is teaching English at a local school. But fifteen years ago, together with her husband, she bought some livestock and began to breed cattle -- raising and milking it. Today her flock includes three heifers and three milking cows. This business brings in about five thousand soms a month, which is a very decent income in the countryside. \r\nAilarahon has four children. Her oldest daughter is studying at a university, her middle one just got married, and her youngest daughter helps her mother around the house and with the business. Her youngest child \u2013 her son \u2013 works construction. \r\nAilrahon is asking for a loan, because she plans to expand her business and buy another cow. In the near future she needs enough resources to fix up her house, buy new furniture and marry off her daughters. She understands that this will involve dedication and constant work. \r\n\r\nShe has three partners in the group:\r\n\r\nGairatbek P. is thirty-five years old, and the last ten of them he has fattened and sold livestock. He buys a bull, fattens it for about three months, and then resells it at the livestock market. He has three growing children, and so he needs to increase his income if he wants to meet the growing needs of his family. With the loan, he would buy a heifer to raise more cattle. \r\n\r\nTillyahan S. is forty-three years old and a mother of three children. Her main objective in life is to raise her children and help them get a good start in life. She\u2019s retired right now and raises livestock and corn for a living.

Despite receiving maintenance from her ex-husband, she no longer wants to rely on anyone else. This is what prompted her to look for different ways to earn money. She began selling clothes and dairy products, going from house to house, however it was not enough to rent a premises and open a shop or even to become a traveling seller. These days she has a secure client base, but she wants to invest more money in stock to sell to even more people. On the other hand, for two years now, Mary has been working together with a group of female friends preparing snacks and dinners for large events. This extra income has enabled her to support her two young children, aged eleven and nine. In the future, she plans to open a clothes shop and create a secure job for herself.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Lucy Williams, Kiva volunteer<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nUna vez que se divorci\u00f3 de su esposo, Mary se vio en la necesidad de trabajar por cuenta propia.

everyday products for the past 8 years.\r\n\r\nShe currently has few products for daily consumption but she wants a loan to buy more products like oil, sugar, rice, noodles, etc.  She says that since she opened this store little by little she has tried to make her business grow, but with the loan she will be able to do it more efficiently as she will be able to have what her clients request available, especially in those months when people buy more.  She has the desire to later open another business which will help her to improve her income as she has 8 children, 3 of whom are students.  She wants her family to have what it needs to live. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Aimee Sostowski, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":213647,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of products to vary her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GT","country":"Guatemala","town":"Santiago, Sacatepequez","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.635278 -90.676389","type":"point"}},"partner_id":97,"posted_date":"2008-10-22T01:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Teresa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-05T12:01:21Z","disbursal_currency":"GTQ","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.58},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2008-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T03:14:24Z","rounded_local_amount":672.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5313276},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T20:26:17Z","rounded_local_amount":672.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9930921},{"amount":90.03,"local_amount":670,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T11:55:02Z","rounded_local_amount":676,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14855547},{"amount":89.59,"local_amount":666.7,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:14:45Z","rounded_local_amount":672.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20395039},{"amount":268.75,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-26T08:16:24Z","rounded_local_amount":2017.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35980406},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":666.67,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:42:05Z","rounded_local_amount":672.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44441210},{"amount":89.59,"local_amount":666.7,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":672.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52951743},{"amount":89.59,"local_amount":666.7,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-24T09:06:30Z","rounded_local_amount":672.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63169006},{"amount":89.58,"local_amount":666.65,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:39:37Z","rounded_local_amount":672.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73594329},{"amount":89.13,"local_amount":663.23,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-29T09:33:58Z","rounded_local_amount":669.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87029800}],"funded_date":"2008-10-22T11:01:21Z","paid_date":"2009-10-29T09:33:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Aimee Sostowski","image":null}},{"id":73668,"name":"Yoli","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Yoli, socia del Banco Comunal Las Trabajadoras, vive en la Regi\u00f3n San Mart\u00edn, provincia de Mariscal C\u00e1ceres, distrito de Juanjui.\n\nTiene 32 a\u00f1os de edad, vive con su esposo y con su hijo.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

When he was a boy he lived near a village where his parents were dryland farmers\u2014they would wait for the rain in order to cultivate the land.  Once he had his own family Silvino moved to his wife\u2019s village, where he farms on irrigated land below the village.  Ever since then he no longer has to wait until the months of September or October to plant (as is the case for dryland farming).  Every time Silvino harvests potatoes, he plants peas, and in other fields he is preparing to plant the next crop of potatoes.  Although there are times when the price of potatoes is lower at the market, it is very profitable when the price goes up.  It is for this reason that Silvino is loyal to this tuber, as growing potatoes enables him to meet the needs of his family.  Silvino is a very gracious customer every time he meets with the other members of his communal bank.  This is his 7th loan with Kiva partner MFP, and he has always been good in making his payments.  The money that Silvino is asking for this time will be used to purchase chemical fertilizers so that he can fertilize his next crop of potatoes.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christopher Knutson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":305019,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchasing fertilizer","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-04-20T02:00:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Silvino","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:25:03Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110733781}],"funded_date":"2009-04-20T03:42:03Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:25:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Chris Knutson","image":1448752}},{"id":106436,"name":"Elizabeth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elizabeth O. started her fish sales four years ago at Oda, where she lives.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

He is now seeking a second loan in order to improve his scope of services and to purchase in Ghana other necessary equipment, such as a computer with a CD and DVD recorder, a TV, a mini Hi-Fi system, DVDs etc. With this loan, he plans to achieve a monthly revenue of 215,000 West African Francs, which will be used to contribute to the family budget, pay off the interest on his loan and reinvest the rest in his business. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":637215,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Electronics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"Purchasing electronic appliances","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-11-10T20:50:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fousseni ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":131.25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:22Z","rounded_local_amount":62605.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188752107},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-01-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:56:38Z","rounded_local_amount":62605.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606370},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:43Z","rounded_local_amount":62605.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195918017},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-03-02T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:10Z","rounded_local_amount":62605.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360943},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:00Z","rounded_local_amount":62605.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226252},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":62605.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301120},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:51:41Z","rounded_local_amount":62605.37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216580738},{"amount":131.25,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2011-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:02Z","rounded_local_amount":62605.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750649}],"funded_date":"2010-11-14T21:09:31Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Katharina S","image":340594}},{"id":250696,"name":"Julieta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Julieta T. is from the town of Lopez Jaena.

He then moved to Mexico to study electronics and satellite systems before relocating to the United States in search of more opportunities. Jorge started working at a company that specializes in building alarm systems\u2014this is where he got the idea to launch his own electronics business. \r\n\r\nFour years later, Jorge\u2019s business offers five core services including security system installation, computer repair, POS system installation, soap distribution, and marketing services for small businesses through his television programs with two TV channels in Boston. Jorge\u2019s son works with him part-time to install alarm systems at local businesses. Today, Jorge is growing his business to serve clients in additional neighborhoods of Boston and was recently recognized as Latino Business Person of the Year by the North Shore Business Association. The impacts of the recession on other businesses have encouraged Jorge to expand and innovate by trading services with other small businesses in his area.\r\n\r\nAfter attending a financial management workshop with Accion USA, Jorge applied for a loan and is using it to purchase cameras, cables, screens and other equipment in bulk.

Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain underserved by financial institutions.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment, forcing hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve the country\u2019s agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients present a viable business proposition.

This association was founded in 1993 by twenty women entrepreneurs to increase their purchasing power by way of a tontine (a revolving credit system in which each member periodically pays a suitable amount and which funds its various members by turns).  This policy does not allow every member to be financed on the same day.  \r\n\r\nThe members decided to join IMCEC in order to award loans without guarantee requirements.  Thus, the members are divided into sub-groups of five, each with a designated president and a treasurer.  These sub-groups, which currently number as many as 63, can be the same for several years but often change their members according to the financing of needs and other considerations.  \r\n\r\nThe AFDE organizes member meetings each month, when all the sub-groups are invited.  It facilitates cooperation for its members, enabling them to buy rice and other goods at better prices.  The AFDE is lead by a president by the name of Ms. Mame Diarra MAR and by a treasurer, Ms. Ndeye Ndella Diouf , both residents of Thi\u00e8s. \r\n\r\nThe president of AFDE 28 is Ms. Bineta S., aged 46, who is married and the mother of four children.  She has been active for three years in selling smoked and dried fish and palm oil at the Grand Thi\u00e8s market.  With the loan, Ms. S. wants to get supplies in Mbour and Diaob\u00e9, two towns where goods are cheap.  She is in this group with the treasurer Ms. Ndeye Sokhna D., a retailer of cosmetics; Ms. Amy T., a retailer of tea and <i>kola<\/i>;  Ms. Fatou F., a retailer of vegetables and fresh fish at her place; and Ms. A\u00efssatou S., a retailer of carrots cabbage, and turnips at the Grand Thi\u00e8s market.  \r\n\r\nAll five group members are requesting an amount of 250,000 francs CFA that they are going to share equally for financing their businesses.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":507245,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Stocking up with merchandise ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2010-03-17T23:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bineta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ndeye Sokhna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"A\u00efssatou Mota","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2010-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":27777.78},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":27777.76}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T12:35:46Z","rounded_local_amount":27961.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136759286},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T10:15:51Z","rounded_local_amount":27961.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144790796},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:25:19Z","rounded_local_amount":27961.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151971232},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T12:16:15Z","rounded_local_amount":27961.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159708504},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T11:40:44Z","rounded_local_amount":27961.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166922557},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:49:21Z","rounded_local_amount":27961.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172189062},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2010-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T16:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":27961.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177484495},{"amount":58.34,"local_amount":27777.78,"processed_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:48:41Z","rounded_local_amount":27961.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182620738},{"amount":58.33,"local_amount":27777.76,"processed_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:54:32Z","rounded_local_amount":27961.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188758332}],"funded_date":"2010-03-18T01:30:50Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:54:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":189246,"name":"Erdenechuluun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erdenechuluun is 40 years old and lives with his wife and two children in Tuv province, Mongolia.

They live as part of traditional families and are of an average age of 42 with at least 6 children each. They met through neighbourly and parental links.  \r\nThe Benkadi group have sold condiments, incense and cosmetics for the past twenty years. There is one lady within the group that is very sought after for the quality of her incense; Hawa Mall\u00e9, aka 'eternal beauty'. Hawa sources her goods from Bamako and intends to buy 3kg of 'magnokisseni' (an incense ingredient), 12 bottles of different fragrances and 1kg of 'djekalani' (another incense ingredient). She combines these three ingredients on the same day and lets the mixture rest for a week. The following week she bottles the mixture and sells it to a customer base made up of women and men buying it for their wives.  Mrs Hawa takes cash, and occasionally credit, sales. \r\nShe hopes to generate a 25,000 FCFA profit every month, and the other group members envisage generating profits of 21,000 FCFA. These profits will enable them to repay their loans and meet their family's needs. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Danielle Treharne, Kiva

This will allow him to pay his rent and cover the family\u2019s expenses.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":875,"image":{"id":626923,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Hardware","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To purchase hardware store items","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2010-10-25T20:30:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":875,"lender_count":29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Salim ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.64},{"due_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36363.6}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.55},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.54},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.55}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":79.55,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:43:13Z","rounded_local_amount":37181.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188752080},{"amount":79.54,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-17T00:57:02Z","rounded_local_amount":37181.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191606328},{"amount":79.55,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:20:01Z","rounded_local_amount":37181.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195917989},{"amount":79.54,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:37Z","rounded_local_amount":37181.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201360915},{"amount":79.55,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:27Z","rounded_local_amount":37181.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226220},{"amount":79.54,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:05Z","rounded_local_amount":37181.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301111},{"amount":79.55,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:52:00Z","rounded_local_amount":37181.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216580735},{"amount":79.54,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:17Z","rounded_local_amount":37181.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750638},{"amount":79.55,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T10:19:40Z","rounded_local_amount":37181.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227120029},{"amount":79.54,"local_amount":36363.64,"processed_date":"2011-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T10:13:22Z","rounded_local_amount":37181.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232881897},{"amount":79.55,"local_amount":36363.6,"processed_date":"2011-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:11Z","rounded_local_amount":37181.11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238699058}],"funded_date":"2010-10-27T12:28:49Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T11:23:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":246612,"name":"Nenisa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nenisa D. is currently in the business of selling fish, cooking oil, and tomatoes at the market and is requesting a loan to stock more onions and jerry cans of cooking oil to sell.

her family stays together happily. Criselda only finished high school, but despite that, she strives to excel in everything she puts her hands into. Criselda is married to Roman, who presently has no work. For now, Criselda takes the responsibility of earning money to meet the needs of their children. Together, they presently live in Pasay City, Philippines.\r\n\r\nCriselda has managed a sari-sari (variety) store for 10 years now. Alongside her variety store is a small food stall where she basically sells rice and viands (tasty dishes) for her neighborhood. The fact that her store stands near a cemetery in Pasay City speaks of her determination to keep her small business running. Training and Bible studies in CCT* enable Criselda to stand firm on what she knows is right and profitable in business not just for herself but also for others around her. Family members assist Criselda in managing the sari-sari store and food stall. Every month, they earn an average of 7,000 Philippines pesos (Php).\r\n\r\nTo further help her grow her business, Criselda applied for a Php13,000 loan. She intends to use this money to add more items to her store and make sure her customers, who are mostly visitors to the cemetery, will find what they need in her store. Definitely, Criselda desires to make her business grow and see to it that it would be profitable for her and her family's benefit.\r\n\r\nThe times when the store has low sales challenge Criselda, as well as debts from her customers that have yet to be paid. She is also worried about her children, who get naughty and need some discipline. Nevertheless, she is determined to overcome these trials and emerge better than she was before, and higher from where she was before. Because, more than a driven entrepreneur, she is a persistent mother who dreams of seeing her children grow as good, responsible citizens. Above all, she prays for a family that stays happily together no matter what.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":657300,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Animal husbandry and farming is the primary business of Narynkul's family.  In 2005, she decided to start her own business of fattening up and reselling livestock and investing an initial amount of 2,000 som (KGS) into the purchase of livestock.  Today, her business has 10 sheep and one cow and yields a monthly income of 6,000 som (KGS).  Narynkul also has 3.2 hectares of arable land, where she grows wheat, barley, clover and potatoes.  Earnings from this business allowed her to provide education for her children, who became teachers.  In order to further grow her business, Narynkul requested a loan in the sum of 50,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to purchase sheep.  She plans to use the income from the loan to repair a barn for livestock.  In the future, Narynkul also wants to expand her business by opening a food market in her

R.

She started the restaurant in August of 2007 with an old grill, and it\u2019s currently the family's only source of income. She has experienced steady growth and demand for her delicious meats, which she attributes to her location and product. She always buys the best meats to cook, and her home is located on the corner of the busy town plaza. With the disposable income she has earned, she has reinvested in the business and bought a new grill, plates, and utensils.  \r\n<p>\r\nThe barbeque business has come naturally to Jany as she has experience managing other businesses. Jany is happy to work from home where she gets to spend time with and take care of her family.

As she only does this during the mornings she looked for another activity to do in the afternoons, like selling sweetcorn on the cob and 'yoltamales' (a sweetcorn dish made with milk that is cooked then solidified), which she makes and sells in her region.  She states that the credits she has received from ADIM have helped her a lot as she now has capital to work.  She is a very industrious woman, she has 3 kids who are in primary school.  It was with a lot of effort that she managed to build a room near the house for her mother.
