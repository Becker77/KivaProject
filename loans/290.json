Nenita is new in town, because she lived in her own city before she decided to permanently settle here in Hamtic. She started her variety store to serve her neighbors with an initial capital of Php 3,000. The income earned from her business was used to finance her children's education. She applied for this loan to buy food and beverages to maintain her variety store.

This will be the second loan taken out by Jemilly from HSPFI. \r\n\r\n\"I plan to use the additional revenue generated from my business to supplement the income of my family and to support the educational needs of my children,\" she answered during the interview of HSPFI Kiva staff.\r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of the accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

She is 28 years old. Melanie is married and has 1 school-aged child. To make a living, Melanie owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Melanie is just starting this business.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Melanie joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. Melanie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from PMPC. Melanie is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory & working capital. This loan will be the 2nd loan taken out by Melanie from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

He will buy a canopy and a large amount of ingredients and supplies for preparing his delicious food.  This will allow him to attract new customers and obtain more operating capital for expanding his business.  In the meantime, Oscar works toward achieving his goals.  He maintains a sales profitability rate of no less than 17.7% and a cash flow of 1.8%.  His inventory turnover period is two days while his accounts payable period is three days.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":822831,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a canopy and a large amount of ingredients and supplies.

His first loans, in the amounts of 5,800, 10,000, and 15,000 meticals, were all also used for his home.

Tobias is a friendly member of the community with 7 children. Tobias lives with his family in a house made of concrete walls, concrete floor, and an iron roof.\n\nBuru Atego village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from Buru Atego borehole. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause water-borne diseases. Chlorine dispensers offer a solution to this problem by allowing people to treat their water to make it safe to drink. Tobias\u2019 family, and the 25 other households using the local water source, need a loan to cover the cost of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. \n\nTobias has volunteered to be the promoter to encourage the community to use the dispenser and to refill it with chlorine when the tank runs low. Tobias volunteered to be the promoter because he wants to help the community to treat water, thus reducing water-borne diseases. There are also four other volunteer promoters from the surrounding community who are part of this group loan: David, Rose, Moses and Jane.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce carbon footprints will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Tobias\u2019 community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1805403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To ensure that the community has access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2250,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tobias","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"David","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moses ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jane ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":2250,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":2250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":375},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":562.5},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":941,"name":"Eufemia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Eufemia Lopez was born in Guayaquil, Ecuador.

Thus, he\u2019ll be able to earn more trust from his customers.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":337057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To buy lumber","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Ago\u00e8","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":111,"posted_date":"2009-06-17T17:10:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":550,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Kodjo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":550,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":18639.9},{"due_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","amount":19012.7},{"due_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":19392.95},{"due_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":19780.81},{"due_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20176.43},{"due_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20579.96},{"due_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","amount":20991.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":21411.39},{"due_date":"2010-03-15T07:00:00Z","amount":21839.61},{"due_date":"2010-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":22276.41},{"due_date":"2010-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":22721.93},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":23176.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.01},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.83},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.66},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.52},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.39},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.28},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.18},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.11},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.05},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.01},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.99},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.01,"local_amount":18639.9,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T21:00:53Z","rounded_local_amount":19229.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63264256},{"amount":41.83,"local_amount":19012.7,"processed_date":"2009-08-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T23:51:27Z","rounded_local_amount":19614.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73705221},{"amount":42.66,"local_amount":19392.95,"processed_date":"2009-09-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T05:19:32Z","rounded_local_amount":20006.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87134787},{"amount":43.52,"local_amount":19780.81,"processed_date":"2009-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T08:48:55Z","rounded_local_amount":20406.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97049046},{"amount":44.39,"local_amount":20176.43,"processed_date":"2009-11-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T15:23:42Z","rounded_local_amount":20814.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103894662},{"amount":45.28,"local_amount":20579.96,"processed_date":"2009-12-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T18:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":21231.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110783268},{"amount":46.18,"local_amount":20991.55,"processed_date":"2010-01-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-28T09:17:36Z","rounded_local_amount":21655.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118170285},{"amount":47.11,"local_amount":21411.39,"processed_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:36:33Z","rounded_local_amount":22088.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":124009290},{"amount":198.02,"local_amount":90014.31,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T10:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":92862.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129038599}],"funded_date":"2009-06-17T19:57:56Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T10:18:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":119749,"name":"Anna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Tanzania!

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":346555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To purchase threads and a sewing machine.

esposo y  sus dos \u00faltimos hijos de 18 y 12 a\u00f1os en casa de un familiar. Se ubica en la ciudad de Lambayeque, a 15 minutos de la ciudad de Chiclayo.\n\nElla se dedica a la confecci\u00f3n de disfraces. Nos comenta que la idea naci\u00f3 cuando sus hijos estaban peque\u00f1os y empezaron a estudiar: ella confeccionaba sus disfraces por s\u00ed sola y los padres de sus compa\u00f1eros de clase. Ellos le dec\u00edan que estaban muy bonitos y luego le empezaron a pedir que confeccionara algunos para sus hijos. Desde ese entonces ha estado trabajando. Ahora se dedica a confeccionar nuevos disfraces en base a pedidos y a alquilar los que ya tiene guardados.\n\nDurante el tiempo en que ha estado trabajando ha  invertido sus ganancias en la compra de m\u00e1s material. Por lo tanto ahora su peque\u00f1o taller est\u00e1 abarrotado de disfraces y no puede mostrarlos a sus clientes. Por este motivo est\u00e1 solicitando por primera vez a Edpyme Alternativa un cr\u00e9dito de 1000 nuevos soles que piensa invertir en la compra de vitrinas o mostradores. Los cuales har\u00e1n que sus dise\u00f1os tengan mejor vista. Tambi\u00e9n piensa invertir en la compra de material para seguir confeccionando disfraces.\n\nElla es una mujer alegre, din\u00e1mica y trabajadora. Su sue\u00f1o es seguir adelante con su negocio. Enith es optimista y le gusta mucho su trabajo. Cada vez que dise\u00f1a sus disfraces lo hace con la mayor pas\u00edon y entrega posibles.\n","en":"Enith is a 40 year old housewife who has 5 children.  She lives with her husband and her two youngest children, ages 18 and 12, in a relative\u2019s house.  She lives in  the city of  Lambayeque, 15 minutes from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is engaged in the making of costumes.  She tells us that the idea was born when her children were small and began going to school:  she used to make costumes on her own for her children and the parents of their classmates.  The parents told her that they were very beautiful, and then they began to ask that she make some for their children.  Ever since then she has been working.  Now she is involved in making new costumes on the basis of orders and to rent out those that she keeps.\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the time she has been working, she has invested her profits in the purchase of more material.  As a consequence, her little workshop is crammed with costumes, and she is not able to show them all to her customers.  For this reason, she is applying for the first time to Edpyme Alternativa for a loan of 1000 new soles that she plans to invest in the purchase of counters or display cases.  This will mean that her designs will be more easily seen.   She also plans to invest in material for continuing to make costumes.\r\n<p>\r\nShe is a cheerful, dynamic, and hardworking woman.  Her dream is to get ahead in her business.  Enith is an optimist and likes her work a lot.  Every time she designs a costume she makes it with the greatest passion and delivers the best possible product.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Richard Brown, Kiva

She is 55 years old. Josephine is widowed and has four adult children. To make a living, Josephine owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling daily-use products and snacks in the local community. Josephine has been engaged in her business for more than eight years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Josephine joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Josephine has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. Josephine is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Josephine from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

This will be her 5th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of 10,000 PHP, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nJosette aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the  Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

One of her children is already married and lives in a new house with her humble husband. The other three children are all single and still live with her. Currently, Mrs. Ke is a good teacher at a secondary school in the Reussey Keo commune. From this business, she is able to earn about $3 per day to cover her family\u2019s daily expenses. She is a resident who works hard to help support her children to get a good education and a good future. What she wants is to have a better quality of life.  She now wants to repair her broken house but she is lacking some funds. Thus, she wishes to apply for a loan from HKL, a partner with Kiva. She describes herself as an easygoing, conscientious, straightforward person who pays punctually.

What he enjoys most about his job is being able to work in peace.  The loan he is requesting will be used to buy more books to restock his store.  \r\n<p>\r\nThis will be his seventh loan with MFP.  He waits for assistance so that he can continue with his work objectives.  This loan of 3000 PEN will be invested in the purchase of more books to expand his store such as fable collections, tales, literary works, dictionaries, and other genres.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":935699,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bookstore","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy books such as fables, tales, literary works, and dictionaries.

Sedangkan untuk hasil panen yang di dapat dalam satu periode adalah Rp. 5.400.000,- Untuk mendapatkan harga pasaran yang lebih tinggi, hasil kebunnya langsung di jual ke pasar umum yang ada di kota Negara.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.

He is 58 years old, married and has five children.  He has been involved in animal husbandry for 10 years.  He breeds goats for sale.  It is known that when goats are well taken care of, they can be bred up to twice per year.  This is why Jurohon decided to obtain this loan, so that he can increase his livestock headcount.  He plans to purchase goats and use the profit for his son\u2019s wedding.  Besides this, Jurohon will be able to supply his customers with quality meat.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":307384,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal Sales","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of goats","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Yavan","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"38.313056 69.043056","type":"point"}},"partner_id":63,"posted_date":"2009-05-03T21:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juruhon","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:24:12Z","rounded_local_amount":154.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44602240},{"amount":40,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:06:27Z","rounded_local_amount":154.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52996812},{"amount":40,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T17:11:48Z","rounded_local_amount":154.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63218035},{"amount":40,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-08-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T20:02:23Z","rounded_local_amount":154.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73647347},{"amount":40,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-09-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T00:23:36Z","rounded_local_amount":154.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87086761},{"amount":40,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T04:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":154.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97002500},{"amount":40,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-16T09:32:40Z","rounded_local_amount":154.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103847356},{"amount":40,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:56:19Z","rounded_local_amount":154.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110738046},{"amount":40,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:13:57Z","rounded_local_amount":154.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118127593},{"amount":40,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:52:49Z","rounded_local_amount":154.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123964378}],"funded_date":"2009-05-11T15:08:53Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:52:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":107477,"name":"Joska","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Joska A. sells groundnut paste and bread at the market.

In 2008, she joined ASHI (Ahon Sa Hirap, Inc.), an MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, with a bagful of hope of gaining access to capital. Her previous loans were carefully invested in a hog-raising business (pigs). The business runs smoothly, and it brings them good profit during times when the pigs are sold in the market. But it takes more than three months before the pigs will be ready to sell.\r\n\r\nJust recently, she decided to shift her business to a more productive business: fishing. She believes that a fishing business would bring her enough profit with less time and effort. Now that she is about to receive her third loan in the amount of 15,000 PHP, she plans to buy 30 pieces of bamboo, thousands of fingerlings and fry, and bundles of fishnet, as well as to pay labor expenses.\r\n\r\nShe is hopeful that, with the help of ASHI and with the trust of KIVA lenders, little by little, she can reach her dreams in life.

and has two children who are 18 and 15 years-old. The eldest child studies at an institute while the youngest studies at the public school. \nMirtha began working in a retail shop as a salesperson. She worked there for many years but had to quit that job because her mother, who was caring for her children, got cancer and passed away. Shortly after, she started working out of her house, selling groceries like rice, sugar, milk, noodles in a cart.

He lives with his wife and child at his father's house in the Massablacoura quarter of Bougouni (the third largest region in Mali). As he didn't go to modern school, he began earning money very early, notably through buying and selling beauty and party products etc. He learned this business from a friend and with 17 years' experience, he is good at his job and is very sought after. This is his first time working with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso. In order to strengthen his business he decided to work with Soro Yiriwaso's loan programme so that he could buy large quantities of highlights, creams, pommades, deodorants and perfumes. He buys his goods in Bamako (the capital of the Republic of Mali) from wholesalers and sells them in his boutique located in the main market in Bougouni. He makes the most sales around religious festivals and New Year parties. His customers are mostly women. With this loan he plans on earning a monthly profit of 52,500 FCFA. With this income he plans on extending his boutique, paying the interest on the loan and covering other necessities.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Lara Francis, Kiva

and college. She hopes that, one day, all them will have a degree and enjoy a stable career. This is because she saw from her five elder children how hard it is to support a family and yourself without a stable  job and income. \r\n<br>Despite feeling unhappy about her children's situation, Josefina has been able to find strength through Kiva partner, ASHI. With ASHI, she has been able to request a loan and finance her family\u2019s rice farming business, which is managed by her husband and sons. The proceeds from this business go towards meeting her family's needs. However, due to sudden climate change, their business and income is affected. For this reason, Josefina requested a loan to purchase a tricycle (motorcycle with sidecar) for a transportation business to be managed by her husband (while she supports  the farming business). Now, Josefina is hoping to purchase another tricycle to be managed by one of her unemployed sons. \r\n<br>Despite the non-stop challenges Josefina encounters in her everyday life as a wife, mother and businesswoman, her hope of having a better kind of life in the future never fades. With ASHI, this hope has become even brighter.

Dalmacia has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 2,880 Philippines pesos (PHP) a month from it.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Dalmacia joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

This will be the second loan taken out by Dalmacia from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About GDMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

Lida B., 48, dreams for the best, but more than that, she acts to make it a reality. Lida is married to Jimmy B., a factory worker. They have three children who are now in elementary, high school, and college. Together, they live in Malaria, Caloocan City. \r\n\r\nLida has taken vocational courses. With the learning she gains as a Community Partner in CCT*, Lida runs her own sari-sari (variety) store to capitalize on the big target market she has in her community. She has been doing business here for seven years. It is quite easy for her since it is a residential business, and there is not much need at present to hire employees. She earns an estimated net income of 500 PHP per day.\r\n\r\nTo help grow her store, Lida is requesting a 22,000 PHP loan. She plans to use the funds to buy more grocery items to put in her store, so that it won\u2019t look bare and incomplete. Lida makes an effort to maintain her business in good shape, because a profitable business translates to family needs being met and the schooling of her children being supported. \r\n\r\nLida struggles with time management when it comes to balancing business, health and family life. However, she sees to it that these struggles will not prevent her from reaching her dreams for her family. She desires to see her small store grow and eventually expand. She dreams of having good health for everyone in the family and being able to send her children all the way through college. Deep inside, she knows that if there is faith, and action, everything will be possible.\r\n\r\nWith her going to CCT fellowship* meeting every week, she was able to improve and enjoy her relationship with God. As a Christian, through the Word of God, she also gained strength and inspiration day after day.\r\n\t\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":700089,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

Business Description<\/h4> <p> Mr. Cesar has been working as a grocer of fruits and cheeses for 20 years now. He learned this trade as an adolescent working for his Uncle and then took this experience to start his own business. He sells his fruits from a bicycle and he travels throughout his neighborhood with his products. He starts working at 8am and finishes at 6pm, with a lunch break from 1pm-3pm, from Monday to Friday and during the mornings on Saturday and Sunday from 8am-1pm. <p> <h4> Loan Use<\/h4> Mr. Cesar wishes to purchase more fruits, and since he also has experience selling prawns, he would like to expand this area of sales. By doing this, he will be able to better tend to his customers and to meet his high demand which is increasing. With this loan he will be able to expand his business even more. <h4> Personal Information<\/h4> Mr. Cesar is 41, married and has 4 children, 3 of whom are in school. His home is made of cement and is only a single story and very simple. His older son helps him with his business and his wife takes charge of household chores. He very much wishes to improve himself and his home, so long as business continues to grow and he brings in higher earnings. He also hopes to improve his family's quality of life. <p> Translated from Spanish by Kiva Volunteer, Kristin Connor.<p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Descripci\u00f3n del Negocio<\/h4> \r\n\t\r\n<p> Don Cesar se dedica hace 20 a\u00f1os al comercio de frutas y queso.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

He is the oldest child and lives in his parents' house with his younger siblings.  In his village, Cesar works the land from November until May, taking utmost care in planting, and the rest of the year he grazes livestock.  Every weekend he goes to the city to go shopping and to visit his relatives.  They are very grateful to him for his agricultural work, but the bad thing is that he cannot rely heavily on the crops because they are seasonal, so he has to wait for the rain for the seeds to germinate.  He has planted 2 hectares of potatoes and is worried about the lack of rain.  He therefore longs to purchase irrigated land, so that he no longer has to worry about the rain or ice, which can cause him to lose his crops.  This is the first time that he has come to MFP (Microfinanzas Prisma, a Kiva field partner), and therefore he commits to making his payments on the set dates.  With the money requested, he will buy 6 sacks of fertilizer for his small farm.

F., Elizabeth M. B., Patrick A., John A. TarawA., Edmon K. and Henry Sesay. They work for a local non-governmental organization called Future In Our Hands (FIOH). This is the first time they are seeking a loan from SMT. Because non-governmental organizations' salaries are usually very small and do not allow one to do something big with their lives, they have  come to seek a loan from SMT to allow them to invest in something meaningful. Some of them will invest their loans in business and others will invest in the education of their children.\r\n\r\nFIOH started its operations in 1993 and has it headquarters in Makeni with sub-offices in Mile 91 and Kabala in the north, and Pujehun in the south. FIOH focuses its operations on agriculture and food security. They also provide micro-finance services to local villages in their areas of operations. FIOH is doing well in serving the community people in their areas of operations, however, as a donor driven organization, they are often faced with financial constraints. \r\n\r\nSamuel (front row right), who is heading this group, is the Admin Officer of FIOH. He is forty-eight years of age. He was born in a village called Yele, in the Tonkolili district. He is married with six children between the ages of one and nineteen. His wife is a businesswoman. Samuel has worked as an Admin Officer for FIOH for three years now. He will use his loan to buy building materials for housing. Though he is not expecting to complete the building of his house with this loan, subsequent loans will certainly complete the building of his house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":307419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy building materials for housing.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-04-21T17:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Samuel A.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elizabeth M.","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Patrick ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"John A.","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Edward ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Henry ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":6600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":733333.33},{"due_date":"2009-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":733333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":733333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":733333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":733333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":733333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":733333.33},{"due_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":733333.33},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":733333.36}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.44},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.45},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.45},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":244.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":244.45},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":244.44},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":244.45},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":244.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":299.44,"local_amount":898333,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:05:57Z","rounded_local_amount":907316.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44611659},{"amount":299.44,"local_amount":898333,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:55:12Z","rounded_local_amount":907316.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008595},{"amount":134.45,"local_amount":403333.99,"processed_date":"2009-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:23:27Z","rounded_local_amount":407367.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230932},{"amount":244.45,"local_amount":733333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:38:05Z","rounded_local_amount":740666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73662633},{"amount":244.44,"local_amount":733333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:21:50Z","rounded_local_amount":740666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102938},{"amount":244.45,"local_amount":733333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:06:20Z","rounded_local_amount":740666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97019950},{"amount":244.44,"local_amount":733333.33,"processed_date":"2009-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:35:58Z","rounded_local_amount":740666.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103864795},{"amount":244.45,"local_amount":733333.33,"processed_date":"2009-12-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:38:57Z","rounded_local_amount":740666.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110754603},{"amount":244.44,"local_amount":733333.36,"processed_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":740666.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118143622}],"funded_date":"2009-04-22T00:24:11Z","paid_date":"2010-02-15T12:32:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":107509,"name":"Bamba","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"BAMBA D.

She is interested in helping her family with household expenses, thus ameliorating her mother's worries about the running of the household. For about three years she has been selling clothing on credit, visiting a great number of people at their homes in order to receive their orders. She does this from Mondays through Fridays, utilizing the weekends to purchase her merchandise at the wholesale clothing shops and the central market in her town. Sandra gives credit to her clients who pay her in small installments during the month, when she visits them regularly to collect. This entire process is very labor intensive and tiring, due to the long distances she has to cover in her visits. This is large investment in time and money which she has to manage quite carefully.\r\n\r\nHer biggest desire is to obtain a shop where she can sell her articles and stop making all those trips, as well as establish herself in a permanent location where her clients can visit her.\r\n\r\nThis is her ninth credit with Microfinanzas PRISMA.

He and his family live together in a ger, a traditional Mongolian nomadic tent. His daughter attends a local primary school. Buyan operates a clothes trading business out of two different containers in his town with the help of his wife. They began their business in 2006, selling a variety of clothing items in a rented container at the local market, with working capital of 1,500,000 MNT, and over the years they managed to establish a successful business in the local community. After years of stable operation, they have expanded their business, and their earnings have enabled them to purchase two containers which they sell their products from. Today their working capital exceeds 6,000,000 MNT. With their business earnings, they were able to not only expand their business but also greatly improve their quality of life. Also, with their business success, they have managed to buy a car for their family. For the future, they plan to build a house in their yard.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women and uses the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are deemed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":825,"image":{"id":237362,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase additional stock of sugar, cooking oil, salt, soap and soda","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Kyela","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-9.583333 33.85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-14T08:10:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Enely A.

With this problem she faced, she thought of having another business in order to increase their income. In order to pursue her plan, she joined ASHI eight months ago. She loaned for a business capital and she then started her RTW buy and sell business. She sells clothes in their village and after six months, she has able to repaid her loan from the profits she had. Now, she applies for a bigger amount of loan which will be used to finance the growth of her RTW buy and sell business. Someday, when she her business has grown, she will be renting a space open to public for more costumers. She also would like her business to become stable to be able to secure her children financial need.

She also lives with her 68 year old grandmother who helps her take care of her daughters and do the household chores.\r\n\r\nElba makes empanadas.  This is a typical dish made with a banana base, which is formed into dough.  It is shaped into a small ball and has a milk or bean filling.  Then it is fried and served with sugar on top.  The empanadas are made in her house.  Her grandmother helps with the process because they make a fair amount.  She sells them to middle school students at a school in her area.  She also sells them at home with help from her grandmother.  Elba is in charge of selling them away from the school as a traveling vendor in neighborhoods and cantons.  Elba puts forth a lot of effort to sell all of her product everyday because it is the only source of income that she has.  She is the only one supporting her family and paying all of the household expenses. \r\n\r\nThat is the reason she is asking for Integral for a loan.

She is married and has two children who are 22 and 26 years old. They work independently. She has a business buying and selling fruits and vegetables. It is worth noting that she started this business 14 years ago. She began by buying small harvests of lemons, which at that time she sold in her mother's market. Later she  decided to start her own business. At present, she is asking for a loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Le\u00f3n 2000 to be invested in purchasing oranges from a 3,500 sq. meter lot. These will be ready to start harvesting in about two months. The harvesting time is about 4 and a half months long. Her dream has always been to have enough of her own capital to not depend on loans to be able to pay for expenses. Nevertheless, she is not complaining about the benefits of financing since it has allowed her to diversify her inventory.  \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ellen Donohue, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":509334,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2010-03-21T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa Maria ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":14000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1166.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":1166.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.34},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.49,"local_amount":1169.75,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:20:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1211.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136676504},{"amount":59.07,"local_amount":1181.33,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1223.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710930},{"amount":57.91,"local_amount":1158.26,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:39:28Z","rounded_local_amount":1199.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152046181},{"amount":57.86,"local_amount":1157.34,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:45:00Z","rounded_local_amount":1198.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159761393},{"amount":59.1,"local_amount":1182.09,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:16:19Z","rounded_local_amount":1224.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166848352},{"amount":57.74,"local_amount":1154.8,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:48:52Z","rounded_local_amount":1196.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172256312},{"amount":59.86,"local_amount":1197.26,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-18T11:08:56Z","rounded_local_amount":1240.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177802329},{"amount":59.18,"local_amount":1183.64,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-17T10:59:40Z","rounded_local_amount":1226.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182956182},{"amount":58.83,"local_amount":1176.64,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:12:15Z","rounded_local_amount":1218.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188685329},{"amount":171.96,"local_amount":3438.89,"processed_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T03:34:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3562.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191424516}],"funded_date":"2010-03-22T15:56:38Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T03:34:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ellen Donohue","image":541577}}]}
