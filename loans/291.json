She is 50 years old, married and has one school-aged child. To make a living, Shirley owns and operates a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling motorcycle spare parts and accessories in the local community. Shirley has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 8,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Shirley joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC which was used to purchase additional products to sell. Shirley is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP which will be used to invest in expanding the business. This will be the fifth loan she has taken out from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

since her husband lost his job, Arcelia started to look for a way to earn money to cover the household expenses. Her friend then suggested that she sell shoes by catalogue, which Arcelia thought was a good idea. This is why she started to sell these products 1 year ago, and little by little she has gained popularity in her residential area. <p>\r\nFortunately, Arcelia counts on a considerable list of customers, which is of great benefit to her. Moreover, her husband was finally able to get a job. Nevertheless, she currently does not have enough resources to be able to buy the merchandise that her customers are requesting, given that she sells her products in installments. For this reason, she is requesting a loan of $250.00 USD that she is willing to repay in 6 months. With this loan, Arcelia will be able to buy the merchandise she needs to be able to fill her customer\u2019s orders; therefore she will not risk losing those customers that she has been able to keep thus far through many efforts. With your support, Arcelia will be able to move her family forward. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nDesde que el esposo de Arcelia se qued\u00f3 sin trabajo, ella comenz\u00f3 a buscar otra manera de poder sacar dinero para tener para pagar los gastos de su casa.

Fue as\u00ed como hace 1 a\u00f1o que comenz\u00f3 a vender estos productos y poco a poco se fue haciendo conocida en su colonia. <p>\r\n\r\n\r\nAfortunadamente Arcelia cuenta actualmente con una lista considerable de clientes. Lo cual le ayuda mucho, adem\u00e1s de que su esposo ya consigui\u00f3 trabajo.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":318509,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase cosmetics and shoes for women.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-13T17:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.55},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":45454.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.36},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.4}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-06-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:40Z","rounded_local_amount":48309.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010856},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-07-27T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:22Z","rounded_local_amount":48309.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233142},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-08-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:53:36Z","rounded_local_amount":48309.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664933},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-09-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:47:23Z","rounded_local_amount":48309.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105645},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-10-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:28:15Z","rounded_local_amount":48309.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022755},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-11-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:56Z","rounded_local_amount":48309.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867991},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2009-12-24T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:47Z","rounded_local_amount":48309.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757192},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":48309.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146304},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:55Z","rounded_local_amount":48309.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984466},{"amount":36.36,"local_amount":45454.55,"processed_date":"2010-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:00:49Z","rounded_local_amount":48309.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015152},{"amount":36.4,"local_amount":45454.5,"processed_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:27Z","rounded_local_amount":48309,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740169}],"funded_date":"2009-05-13T19:00:23Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Judy Naegeli","image":264373}},{"id":112025,"name":"Neder","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Neder tiene 23 a\u00f1os, vive con sus padres en la casa de ellos.

Dustmurod is married and has one small child. Dustmurod is a unique entrepreneur. He has been a market vendor for about eight years. During that time he has become very popular at the market and has many clients. The secret of his success is simple: he tries to not only let his customers know the benefits of his products \u2013 he also gives them a sense of relationship which brings them back again and again. However, he doesn\u2019t want to stop where he is now with his venture. Dustmurod is seeking a loan of 6,000 TJS to re-stock the merchandise in his store. We believe that Dustmurod\u2019s desire to excel in pleasing his customers will determine his further success and encourage new customers to buy from him.   \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

With the earnings she could improve her family\u2019s food and education. Rosa Etelvina G. dreams of being able to expand her house and make some improvements to it because it is quite deteriorated.

Musarat\u2019s husband requires a loan to repair their wagon. Asia\u2019s husband requires cash to purchase a rickshaw (local three-wheeled vehicle) for her husband. We are all like family and I know them well enough to accept responsibility for

She is a single mother of two children, and lives in her own home.  For the past year, Rosario has been selling second-hand clothing to people who live far outside the city.  Rosario likes her work, because it allows her to visit beautiful areas full of vegetation where her clients live.  Furthermore, her business is profitable, because she buys her products at cheap prices, and although she doesn't raise her prices much because she knows that her clients don't have much money, she is able to sell all of her items during each trip and therefore earn a good amount of money.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Rosario wants to purchase a car in order to carry more clothing with her on her sales trips, as she currently sells only what she can carry on herself.  This is her first loan with MFP.  She is very interested in working with her communal bank, as she sees that its members are dynamic and responsible.  With the loan proceeds, Rosario will purchase more clothing in order to increase her sales.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Scott Lucas, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":326963,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase inventory for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-06-02T19:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosario","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":119.36},{"due_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":125.4},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":130.57},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":135.4},{"due_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":142.37},{"due_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":146.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.03},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.11},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.88},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.54},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":48.94},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":50.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":41.03,"local_amount":119.36,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":124.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990653},{"amount":43.11,"local_amount":125.4,"processed_date":"2009-07-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:42:04Z","rounded_local_amount":130.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211764},{"amount":44.88,"local_amount":130.57,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":135.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641290},{"amount":46.54,"local_amount":135.4,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:36:22Z","rounded_local_amount":140.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080728},{"amount":48.94,"local_amount":142.37,"processed_date":"2009-10-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:06:25Z","rounded_local_amount":148.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96996869},{"amount":50.5,"local_amount":146.9,"processed_date":"2009-11-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:33Z","rounded_local_amount":152.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842227}],"funded_date":"2009-06-02T23:00:21Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Scott Lucas","image":133535}},{"id":116137,"name":"Doris","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Doris A. sells shoes to her customers.

She has been separated for some time from the father of her 3 children, who live with her in her own house, but which is only half constructed.  For the past 15 years, she has dedicated herself to the weaving of jackets, a business in which has grown little by little, especially with designs typical for tourists, thanks to the recent demand in these types of pieces of clothing.  As a result, Ana rented a stand in a busy area, a place very near the embarkation for trips leaving the country.  Since then, she has improved considerably her situation.  She has been asked to add embroidery to her jackets and she doesn't hesitate to do so, which means she is making a lot more than before.  She does her work with ease, since she has always had skillful hands at weaving since she was a little girl.

She lives with her husband and their two small children in San Jacinto, a town in the department of Bol\u00edvar.  The town is well known for producing hammocks, backpacks, and the most beautiful crafts in Colombia, and that is precisely what Noredis does in her business.  She learned this trade as a family tradition, and her job now allows her to help her family improve its quality of life.  Through her job and the help she has already received, Noredis is working so that she can purchase her own house and provide a decent life for her children.  She is also a social worker who belongs to the farmers and artisans cooperative, which has industrial sewing machines for the use of its members.  \r\n\r\nThis is Noredis\u2019s second loan with the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation.   She has participated in its programs for a little less than two years\u2014her first loan was cancelled because she invested a large part of the capital in purchasing a plot of land and had to wait to recover more of her investment.  She is now seeking a loan of 2,000,000 Colombian pesos so that she can purchase supplies such as yarn, ornaments, and lining for making handbags and yarn and ornaments for making hammocks.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have her own house with premises for her business, and for her business to grow so that she can ensure her children\u2019s future.  The biggest challenges that Noredis faces are above all her relations with her family, since there are few employment possibilities in the town where they live.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from

Gwaan, Brgy. Balaring, Silay City, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: dressmaking, fish vending and RTW businesses. Her husband Eduardo D., who is 59 years old, works as a fisherman and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children aged between 13 and 33. \r\n\r\nRosemarie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosemarie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of 18000 PHP helped her earn a monthly profit of 9000 PHP, raising the family's standard of living. This time, for her 16th loan, she is borrowing 19000 PHP, for a screen for the house and to buy more clothes to sell so she can continue to save for the future and have her own dress shop someday. \r\n\r\nRosemarie D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. About NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon \u2014 a title of esteem bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Despu\u00e9s de pensarlo, compr\u00f3 una m\u00e1quina para elaborar tortillas de harina y fue as\u00ed como comenz\u00f3. Primero vend\u00eda tortillas de harina y poco a poco fue incluyendo otros productos de comida, como chiles rellenos, o guisos para hacer banquetes. <p>\r\n\r\nActualmente la demanda se le est\u00e1 incrementando, sin embargo no cuenta con recursos suficientes como para poder elaborarlos. Es por eso que Ramiro est\u00e1 solicitando un cr\u00e9dito de US $475 que est\u00e1 dispuesto a pagarlos en un plazo de 4 meses y con este dinero podr\u00e1 comprar materia prima para poder elaborar sus productos. Con tu ayuda lograr\u00e1s que Ramiro saque adelante su negocio para que este pueda crecer poco a poco y se convierta en un patrimonio para sus tres hijos en caso de que algo le llegara a pasar a Ramiro."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":108360,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase basic materials - Comprar materia prima","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Linares","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"24.857778 -99.567778","type":"point"}},"partner_id":16,"posted_date":"2007-12-31T20:10:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ramiro Santiago","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-01-14T21:21:23Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2008-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2008-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1250},{"due_date":"2008-05-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":119,"local_amount":1252.63,"processed_date":"2008-01-31T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-30T09:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1295.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":125167},{"amount":119,"local_amount":1252.63,"processed_date":"2008-02-29T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-30T09:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1295.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144596},{"amount":119,"local_amount":1252.63,"processed_date":"2008-03-31T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-30T09:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1295.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":169846},{"amount":118,"local_amount":1242.11,"processed_date":"2008-04-30T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-30T09:28:58Z","rounded_local_amount":1284.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":196083}],"funded_date":"2007-12-31T21:21:23Z","paid_date":"2008-04-30T09:03:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":34210,"name":"Kabojja B2(B) Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sefuloza is a single mother of two children.

Ayush's husband is employed by a privately held company as an electrician. \r\n\r\nAyush stayed at home to take care of her daughter until 2006. In 2006, she began to work as a saleswoman at someone's food stall at the local market, Enhjin. In 2007, after she had gained experience, she started running her own tiny business by renting a food stall at the same market. Ayush took a loan from the bank to buy food products, including pickles, mayonnaise and several types of bottled salads to create a business inventory. From her business profits, she repaid the full amount of the loan. \r\n\r\nNow Ayush's son helps her business. The monthly rent she pays for her stall is 80,000 MNT ($1.00 USD=1500 MNT). Her daily average income is 40,000-60,000 MNT. She earns a profit of around 20 percent. From the business profit, she paid for her son's tuition. With this loan, Ayush will invest in more of the food products that she buys from wholesalers.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":278372,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

Safarali is a simple farmer with simple dreams \u2013 to uplift his family\u2019s economic life and to be able to send his dearest little son to school in future. Farming has been his major source of income. Safarali produces wheat, rice and onion. Because of the expensive farm inputs, traders buy their rice products at a lower price. Hence, he requests a loan of US $850 to support his farming business and to avoid asking credits from traders who charge higher interest. He is grateful that he is able to borrow from Kiva lenders who offer lesser interest and create better opportunities for him, thus helping his family to become poverty free. Safarali believes that through prayers and hard work he can achieve his dreams someday. Educating his son is one of his priorities. \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Habibullo lives in the town of Isfara along with his family. Through much effort he dedicates himself to the production of potatoes, onions and watermelons. He tends to his crops himself, with the help of one brother.\r\n\r\nOne of Habibullo\u2019s biggest problems is the marketing of his product and, due to distance, he sells his crop piecemeal which reduces his income to support the family. He has asked for a loan of 2,500 Somoni that will be spent on the purchase of seeds and fertilizer. This would allow him greater earnings which, in turn, would improve his family\u2019s standard of living. His biggest desire is to participate in this future venture so he can improve his profits and provide a better life for his family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling health and medicinal products to tourists and local community members. Edna has been engaged in her business for more than 10 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Edna joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Edna has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8000 PHP from GDMPC. Edna is requesting a new loan of 10000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by Edna from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three unit offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisher folks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Sometimes this task seems to us as something unattainable, a task, requiring unbelievable efforts.  However, if we observe people surrounding us in our daily lives, we notice right away that it is not such a difficult task.  All that a person needs in order to start earning is, before all else, a will to work.  The heroes of our story want to work hard and work for the benefit of their families.  Altyngul M. is the leader of this group.  Altyngul and her family lives in the city of Karabalta.  She is twenty-nine years old and has two children, who are eight and six years old.  In order to support the family, Altyngul's husband works at a market and so does she.  She is involved in retail sales of children's toys.  Altyngul confidently leads her busy retail business.  She always feels that her husband is next to her, and he helps her however he can in his free time.  Altyngul has a stable monthly income of close to ten thousand seven hundred som.  And seven years ago, when they first started their business, it looked like a fairly fragile enterprise.  Then, they obtained a loan and invested close to fifteen thousand som and bought the merchandise.  Over the last few years, thanks to this business, they were able to buy a house and furnish it with new furniture.  Altyngul requested this loan because she wants to buys merchandise with the goal of expanding the selection.  In the future, her plans also include buying a car, repairing a house and buying a cow.\r\n\r\nAltyngul's partners are:\r\n\r\nRoza T. is 35 years old.  She is a mother of three children, all of whom go to school.  Roza's husband works at a construction site, and Roza is involved in sales.  Roza hopes to obtain this loan and buy merchandise.\r\n\r\nBaktygul U. is 37 years old.  Her husband is retired, and Baktygul works at a distillery.  Together they are raising two children.  Baktygul needs a loan in order to buy furniture.\r\n\r\nMira M. is 42 years old.  She has three children, and in order to support the family, both she and her husband have to work.  Her husband is involved in passenger transportation.  Mira is involved in sales of groceries.  She requested this loan because she wants to buy merchandise in order to increase goods turnover.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Russian by Anna Sorokina-Hailey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1500,"image":{"id":569597,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase toys to expand merchandise selection","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Karabalta","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":135,"posted_date":"2010-07-20T04:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1500,"lender_count":41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Altyngul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roza ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Baktygul","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mira","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":70000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":1500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":12787},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":13280},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":14035},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":14605},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":15293}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":274.01},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":284.57},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300.75},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":312.96},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":327.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":274.01,"local_amount":12787,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":12854.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166884428},{"amount":284.57,"local_amount":13280,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:24:07Z","rounded_local_amount":13350.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172151556},{"amount":300.75,"local_amount":14035,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:11:11Z","rounded_local_amount":14109.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177446579},{"amount":312.96,"local_amount":14605,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:57:31Z","rounded_local_amount":14682.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182585746},{"amount":327.71,"local_amount":15293,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:01:14Z","rounded_local_amount":15373.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188721591}],"funded_date":"2010-07-20T17:14:39Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:01:14Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Anna Sorokina","image":null}},{"id":219433,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Mar\u00eda tiene 55 a\u00f1os, vive en su casa propia en compa\u00f1\u00eda de su esposo y sus 4 hijos.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures: fishing and fish vending businesses. Her husband, Sandy A., who is 32 years old, works as a fisherman to earn his living, and also helps in his wife's business activities. They have 3 children who are between 9 to 13 yrs old years old. Salvacion joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 18 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Salvacion has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 21000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 15600, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 19th loan, she is borrowing PHP 20000, which she intends to use for the purchase of fishing gear and equipment so that she can continue to save up for future house repairs and for the education of her children. Salvacion A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams.\t\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

However, she is particularly interested in the income it generates. \r\n\r\nMadame Bineta has been a member of one of the UIMCEC branches since August 2011. She is requesting a loan of 100,000 frs to buy basic ingredients, such as rice, oil, and beans, for the meals that she sells. Her goal is to make her purchases in large enough quantities to benefit from more competitive prices, but also to save time and not have to go out every day to buy what she needs. Thus she hopes to increase the profitability of her business, as the profits would allow her to improve the living conditions of her family."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":928698,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy ingredients for the meals she prepares.

A year ago, Ikrom came to Microinvest. As his business is capital-intensive, the first amount he took was $850. The whole loan he spent on purchasing spare parts.

In the next round of lending, she hopes to borrow 5,000,000 VND (300 USD) to buy feed for her pigs.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Robert Sides, Kiva

Considering that her husband works as a teacher and earns little, her coat  business  has been a valuable source of income for her and her family. In a typical month Bibisoida makes about $400 in profit from the business. Bibisoida has requested a loan of $ 800 USD to purchase new inventory. This loan will help her to continue developing her business and provide a good income for her family.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rafokat is a woman of great courage and dedication who struggles to put food on the table for her children. She is a diligent mother who has always strived for the health and well-being of each member of her family. Throughout this season, she directs herself towards the fields where she plants potatoes. She sells the fruits of her labor at various local markets. In addition, as an extra income, Rafokat raises cattle at her house. She plans to commercialize her crops at a much greater scale, but for this she needs a loan that will allow her to invest in such a project. Let\u2019s contribute to this great effort done by a mother who wants the best for her beloved family.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from selling a variety of different products in the local community. Wilma has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.<P>\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Wilma joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Wilma has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to finance their farm and her variety store. Wilma is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the 3rd loan taken out by Wilma from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to support the education of her children and as supplement income.<P> \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<P>\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

For a year she has been selling salchipapas (hot chips and fried sausages). To do this she set up a salchipapa cart (mobile for fast food) outside her home. Usually she works alone, from 6pm until midnight, although sometimes when it is not busy she stays open until one in the morning so that she can sell all her servings. Nelly is very satisfied with her business as it generates a good income, she does not have competition nearby and her regular customers prefer her, as it is a good option when they arrive tired from work and are looking for her delicious food to satisfy their appetites. Being an enterprising woman she has noted that her business has grown quite a lot, therefore she has planned, in the following months, to install a small wooden kiosk outside her home where she will put the salchipapa cart with seats and tables for her customers.\r\n\r\nThis is Nelly's first loan with MFP and she is very grateful to all the people that make the loan possible thus allowing her to continue working. She is intending to use the loan to buy a piece of wood to set up her kiosk.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Catherine Dent, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":510139,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Stall","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Development of her kiosk","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-03-21T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nelly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":119.94},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":125.82},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":130.1},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":136.05},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":141.11},{"due_date":"2010-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":146.98}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.98},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.18},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.79},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.02},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.91},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.12}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":44.98,"local_amount":119.94,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:25Z","rounded_local_amount":128.73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136718181},{"amount":47.18,"local_amount":125.82,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:45Z","rounded_local_amount":135.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751856},{"amount":52.32,"local_amount":139.52,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:13Z","rounded_local_amount":149.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934316},{"amount":101.52,"local_amount":270.71,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:00Z","rounded_local_amount":290.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886913},{"amount":54,"local_amount":144.01,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:39Z","rounded_local_amount":154.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172153917}],"funded_date":"2010-03-21T02:21:25Z","paid_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Catherine Dent","image":null}},{"id":190772,"name":"Cotoque\u00f1os Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Es un grupo conformado de 10 personas, los cuales viven en el municipio de Cotoca de la cuidad de Santa Cruz, este grupo fue formado por la Sra.

Her husband, who works abroad hoping to improve their lives by providing her enough financial support, left her for another woman. Despite that painful event in Rosalia\u2019s life, she has never thought of giving up her dream for her child. Instead she became tough and determined to face challenges in achieving her goal. \r\n\r\nRosalia had started her own small variety store in 2008, financed by a loan through Kiva's field partner, ASHI. Since then she has her own source of income for supporting her needs, and most especially her child\u2019s. Though sustainability has been a challenge for her because income is not yet liquid for supporting her family\u2019s entire needs, Rosalia still clings to her dream of making her store profitable and successful. Because of that, she is now requesting a much larger loan through ASHI. \r\n\r\nAlthough Rosalia fails in her love life, she still has a lot of things to feel fortunate about in her life.

Tumarbong, Roxas, Palawan. She earns her living by operating three business ventures: hog raising, manicure\/pedicure and food vending businesses. Annalie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2007 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past five loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Annalie has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. \r\n\r\nHer previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 10,500, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her sixth loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use to purchase additional piglets, pig food and vitamins so that she can continue to save up for the future to have her own piggery and for business expansion. Annalie is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means 'Honorable'). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<p>\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<p>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<p>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Gyan Maya has already received and repaid four loans from Patan BPW, and used her most recent one to buy grocery goods for her business.  In the future, she plans to continue to uplift the economic condition of her family. She thanks you for your support. <p>\r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, small grocery stores, called pasals, are an important part of the local economy.  Fresh produce, milk, and staples such as rice, lentils, and flour are purchased daily for cooking in the home.  Owners of small grocery stores use Kiva loans to increase their purchasing power and profit margains.  By keeping inventory strong and purchasing in larger amounts, owners of these small stores are able to increase profitability.  While a typical pasal might be no more than 100 sq. feet, they are always full of bargaining customers, incoming produce, and shrewd businesswomen. <p>\r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, which provide the rural poor throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these groups are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional associations from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities. Senegal Ecovillage Microfinance (SEM) works with our partner organization CRESP to bridge this gap by linking traditional village credit associations with outside sources of finance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":2893,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Dried fish production","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Palmerin","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":4,"posted_date":"2006-11-06T22:31:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":775,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mathias","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-11-21T00:02:32Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":775,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":775,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77.5},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":77.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":140,"local_amount":140,"processed_date":"2007-02-09T19:40:09Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-12T19:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":140,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":7148},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-03-12T18:23:17Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-12T19:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10066},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-04-16T21:58:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-12T19:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":13111},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:56:10Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-12T19:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16915},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:56:31Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-12T19:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16931},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:56:45Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-12T19:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16947},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-05-21T20:56:59Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-12T19:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16963},{"amount":73,"local_amount":73,"processed_date":"2007-07-22T20:35:30Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-12T19:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":73,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":34420},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-08-12T03:56:48Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-12T19:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":41441},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-09-03T16:58:14Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-12T19:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":50177},{"amount":70,"local_amount":70,"processed_date":"2007-10-06T00:30:59Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-12T19:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63320},{"amount":142,"local_amount":142,"processed_date":"2007-11-11T16:34:21Z","settlement_date":"2007-11-12T19:15:27Z","rounded_local_amount":142,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":80024}],"funded_date":"2006-11-07T00:02:32Z","paid_date":"2007-11-11T16:34:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":5569,"name":"Fale","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fale is a 36 year old mother with 6 kids. 2 are working, 3 are in school and 1 has been adopted by her sister.

She started her business with very little merchandise and traveled to the city of Lima to sell bread made in the mountains of La Libertad, manjar blanco (a sweet paste similar to dulce de leche) and other sweets.  Thankfully, she had family in that area and has become known among their neighbors and others in nearby area.  These days, since she brings bread and other things to Lima to sell, she brings back clothing and other products from there to sell in Trujillo and El Porvenir to her neighbors and friends. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teresa is a member of the V\u00edctor Ra\u00fal communal bank where she obtained her first loan of 300 Nuevo Sol (Peruvian currency) and with this money purchased a variety of bread, sweet rolls and sweets.  With this loan of 1300 Nuevo Sol ($475), which she will repay in four months, she will travel to Lima to purchase clothes, gift items, and sweatshirts in large quantities as in this season they are the most requested items.

Vali dedicates himself to the business of raising livestock. He distinguishes himself by having a lot of experience when it comes to livestock. He supports his spouse and four children and also provides for their education. It is important to note that thanks to his hard work he has been able to give his children his support so that they can get ahead. Vali is hoping for the assistance of IMON with the goal of obtaining a loan of $500. This will allow him to purchase young cattle to increase his herd, so as to earn more income. Both Vali and his loving family will benefit from this loan.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International:\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road, the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her previous loans were carefully used as rolling capital for her fishing business. Because fishing allows her to earn just enough income for her family needs, she recently ventured into raising pigs, an enterprise that will bring her enough profit to save for the future of her children.  Fishing will now become her secondary business.<p>\r\n\r\nShe is now requesting her ninth loan, 45,000 pesos to pay for 10 piglets, 26 sacks of assorted feeds, vitamins and transportation expenses.  Lourdes is hopeful that the trust and opportunity given by ASHI and KIVA, coupled with hard work, will allow her to reach her dreams of expanding her business, sending her children to school, and building a new and more spacious

Merlyn has been in business for over five years and earns approximately 10,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Merlyn joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Merlyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 7,000 PHP from GDMPC. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional seeds, seedlings and young crops to raise. Merlyn is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase fertilizer, such as manure. This loan will be the third loan taken out by Merlyn from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Besides, she would like to have a larger business so that she can offer employment to others.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":483373,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Tailoring","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy fabric.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2010-02-05T20:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Elena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.33},{"due_date":"2010-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":833.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:09:11Z","rounded_local_amount":872.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123912268},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":833.33,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:51:15Z","rounded_local_amount":872.29,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130493530},{"amount":84.08,"local_amount":1681.55,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:10Z","rounded_local_amount":1760.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710772},{"amount":41.72,"local_amount":834.39,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":873.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152046042},{"amount":40.87,"local_amount":817.4,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:44:24Z","rounded_local_amount":855.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159761254}],"funded_date":"2010-02-06T03:01:54Z","paid_date":"2010-08-16T08:44:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":178197,"name":"Faleseu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Faleseu T. is 35 and married with 5 children (ages 2 - 15).  She owns a business venture, selling pancakes (fried flour pancakes flavored with lemon or coconut jam).  Faleseu has 3 years of experience in this business.  Faleseu needs a loan of WST $2000 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Faleseu joined SPBD.    This is her 3rd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Faleseu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Faleseu T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                         1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:            1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:                1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

Her husband is a taxi driever. Zulaikho started her business in 2001 in order to support her family. All year she sells fruits and vegetables that she buys from local farmers. With the loan of 5000 TJS from Kiva, she plans to increase the range of her products and to buy apples, pears, grapes, peaches, and other fruits. Zulaikho strives to give her children a better life, including supporting them through a high level of education. With her business, she has been able to supply the community with fresh fruits and also provide for her family. Zulaikho is a well-spoken, friendly business woman who is worthy of the support of Kiva partners.   \r\n \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She runs a small business selling groceries at a local market. Rafoatkhon has been in this business for 10 years. She is very industrious and a hard worker. Her integrity, determination and perseverance have ensured the sustainability and growth of her business. Rafoatkhon has gradually been able to save some money and reinvest it in her business. Between these savings and loans from IMON International, she has been able to increase her inventory and sales volume. Rafoatkhon is requesting a loan for 12,000 Somoni that will allow her to increase her assortment of inventory. She is planning to buy food products wholesale for further retail sales. This loan will help Rafoatkhon increase her inventory and cater to an ever-increasing number of customers, further promoting stable expansion for her business.\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her previous loan of PHP 16,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. \r\n\r\nNoly aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

She is married and has 3 children, all of whom are in school.     Unisi has a business of selling new shoes. She has been in this business for over 10 years, and she works 6 days out of every week. Unisi sells her products in the Old tax park in Kampala city by means of retail.\r\n\r\nUnisi has requested for a loan of 800,000 Ugandan Shillings from MCDT SACCO, which she will use to buy more bales of second hand shoes. The main business challenge(s) for Unisi include the rainy season and ever increasing prices of second hand shoes.

ventures: seaweed culturing and fishing. He lives in Bantayan, Cebu. \r\n\r\nBonifacio joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because he aspired for something better for his family. With the help of his past nine loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Bonifacio has been incrementally lifting his family out of poverty by the sweat of his brow. His previous loan of 11,000 Philippines pesos (PHP) helped him earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  \r\n\r\nThis time, for his 10th loan, he is borrowing PHP 11,000, which he intends to use to buy fishing gear and equipment so that he can continue to save up for the future expansion of his business. \r\n\r\nBonifacio is a Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means honorable) man who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of his dreams.  \r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF: <\/b>In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon. Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.
