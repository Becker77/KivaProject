He studied through ninth grade, when conditions did not permit him to continue.  He is single and the father of seven children: the oldest are 16-year-old twins, the second is 12, the third 9, the fourth 7, the fifth 5, and the youngest only 1 year old.  J\u00falio is responsible for even more, sending food and money to his parents monthly, as he lives with their first two children.  <p>\r\n\r\nJ\u00falio began working in 1986 as a driver at the Hotel Pequenos Libombo, holding that position for eight years.  The salary was low and did not manage to cover the household expenses.  He therefore decided to quit working for his employer and to start his own business of selling fish in the informal market.  He was able to buy a car which has helped him greatly, even today.  J\u00falio moved out of his parents' house when he was able to do so.  Now he has his own business at his house and an employee who makes 1500 meticals (mt) per month working from 7:00am to 3:00pm.  J\u00falio earns 8400mt  per month, making 420mt per sack and using up 20 sacks per month.  He is not able to save anything because there are many expenses.  <p>\r\n\r\nThis is J\u00falio's second loan with Hluvuku [MFI Field Partner] and his first with Kiva.  The first was for 10,000mt and was used to buy construction material to finish his work.  He succeeded in paying off the loan before it was due.  J\u00falio then returned and requested this loan of 20,000mt which he will use to buy brick-building material.  J\u00falio believes that this loan will improve his business because it will allow him to meet the needs of his clients.  For J\u00falio, his big dream is to increase his business and to send his children through school.  <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Portuguese by April Newman, Kiva Volunteer.  <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nJ\u00falio nasceu em Namaacha uma que faz fronteira com a Swazilandia, solteiro, estudou at\u00e9 9\u00aaClasse, teve que parar de continuar com os estudos pois as condi\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o permitiam para que ele continuasse. \u00c9 pai de 7 filhos sendo os primeiros g\u00e9meos e tem 16 anos, segundo tem 12 anos, o terceiro 9 anos, o quarto 7 anos, o quinto 5 anos e o mais novo tem 1 ano apenas. J\u00falio responsabiliza-se mais ainda pelos seus pais enviando comida e dinheiro mensalmente pois este vivem com os seus dois primeiros filhos.<p>\r\n\r\nJ\u00falio come\u00e7ou a trabalhar em 1986 como motorista no Hotel Pequenos Libombo tendo exercido a fun\u00e7\u00e3o durante 8 anos. O sal\u00e1rio era pouco n\u00e3o chegava para cobrir com as despesas da casa  dai decide deixar de trabalhar no patr\u00e3o abrindo o seu pr\u00f3prio negocio de venda de peixe no mercado informal e conseguiu comprou um carro que lhe vem ajudando muito at\u00e9 hoje. Julio saiu da casa dos pais quando se juntou e hoje tem seu pr\u00f3prio estaleiro em sua casa e tem um trabalhador que aufere mensalmente um valor de 1500,00mt trabalhando das 7:00h as 15:00h. Tem lucrado mensalmente 8400,00mt sabendo que num saco ganha 420,00mt e gasta 20 sacos por mes, n\u00e3o consegue poupar nenhum valor pois tem muitas despesas.<p>\r\n\r\nEste \u00e9 o segundo empr\u00e9stimo do J\u00falio na Hluvuku e primeiro no Kiva. O primeiro foi de 10000,00mt e usou para comprar material de constru\u00e7\u00e3o para concluir a sua obra. Ele conseguiu pagar o empr\u00e9stimo antes do prazo determinado. Assim o J\u00falio volta a solicitar este empr\u00e9stimo de 20000,00mt que usara o dinheiro para comprar material para fabrico de Blocos de cimento.

She plans to invest this loan in a motorbike. In the past she has taken out loans to sell vegetables, and do crops and pig farming. The motorbike will be used as a taxi in the area. She has already found a driver (her son) for her bike who will pay her at the end of each day. <P>\r\n \r\nThis is Beltha\u2019s fifth loan; she has been a GHAPE member since 2003.  Bikes are one of the most efficient forms of transport in and around Bamenda.  As many of the roads are in shambles, bikes are often able to move through these areas quicker and without suffering as much damage as cars.  Beltha will continue her profitable firewood business for extra income.  <P>\r\n\r\nRecently Beltha was very upset when her husband sold their only piece of land. And he also married another lady and stopped paying school fees for their son. Beltha is ready to build her life back with loans from GHAPE and collaboration from her son. <P>\r\n\r\nWith the profit from this loan, Beltha plans to repair her family house.  She also plans to take care of her family, pay school fees, ensure that they eat well, and buy their medication.  She knows she will be able to repay this loan because of the low interest rate and the lengthy repayment period.<P>\r\n \r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.  GHAPE instils a sense of family and community within its clients and staff and has developed a strong bond of trust between the organization and its clients.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":253050,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of a motorbike, fuel, and paying for documents","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CM","country":"Cameroon","town":"Ntaghem, Bamenda, NW.

They live in the district of Cayalti, located an hour from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nShe has worked raising pigs for a year.

However, she has found an excellent way to help her husband in supporting the family. While staying at home, Lira has started manufacturing traditional articles and handing them in to the shops to sell. Surprisingly, her articles attracted many customers and Lira started to earn decent money. Now, her monthly income is around $155.\r\n\r\nLira wants to start raising turkeys.

A 31-year-old mother of two kids, she lives in the town of Angono, Rizal Province, in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nJoy\u2019s main goal is to build a sustainable business to meet the needs of her children; she was thus encouraged to join ASHI (Ahon sa Hirap, Inc.), a MFI and KIVA partner in the Philippines, in 2001. The previous loans she received from Kiva were carefully invested in her restaurant. Since then, the restaurant has been performing well and earning sufficient profit. She is grateful that she has been able to educate her children using proceeds from her business as she continues to expand. Joy needs a loan to help boost her business for increased profit.\r\n\r\nNow requesting her sixth loan, she is requesting 40,000 pesos as additional capital for her restaurant, to be used to pay for cases of beer, liquor, pork, chicken, groceries for her enterprise and an additional videoke karaoke machine.\r\n\r\nJoy is optimistic that she can achieve her dreams of providing a good life for her children and being able to send them to school until they finish college. She also hopes to expand her business and if possible she can have a branch in the town of Taytay, Rizal, in order to provide employment to others. She hopes that these dreams will come true and that ASHI will give the best direction and opportunity to her family.\r\n\r\nShe is happy that her living condition is better than in the past because she can generate more income from the business. Joy would like to send all the best wishes to all her lenders around the world. She hopes that they will support her again in the future.\r\n\r\nAbout ASHI: Ahon sa Hirap Inc.

He works in agriculture, growing crops such as beans, corn and potatoes. He also keeps livestock, taking care of his herd and buying and selling animals. He will use the loan to buy 4 steers to raise and sell. He will then put the income from these 4 animals to further use. Fidel Salvador began selling livestock after the harvest season for his crops ended, in order to have an additional type of work. At first, he sold calves that were born to his cows, keeping only one female. When he saw that this was going well and producing profits, he began to work with financial support from us to buy more animals and increase his income. \r\n\r\nFidel Salvador dedicates himself full-time to agriculture. After the winter harvest, he plants staple crops such as beans and corn to sell. He also raises vegetables such as potatoes, using an irrigation system. He does this work in summer, and he also works buying and selling livestock. \r\n\r\nBefore he started raising livestock, he worked exclusively raising staple crops in the winter season. He has done this work since his childhood, since he grew up in the countryside and was accustomed to this work. Now, with this additional livestock business, he hopes to continue improving the effectiveness of his work, increasing the number of cattle he sells and thus obtaining more income and having work throughout the year. Fidel has a wife who helps him in his work as well as with the household chores, such as preparing food and taking care of their children. He has 4 children who are in school and who also help him on the farm.\r\n\r\nFidel has been a client of Ceprodel for 9 years and has received 12 loans to support his agricultural work. Fidel has constantly improved his farming and ranching business and his standard of living, thanks to the impact and benefits of the loans granted by Ceprodel, which have allowed him to raise the quality of life for his family.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":509492,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buying 4 steers to raise ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":825,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fidel Salvador","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":16600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":16600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":825}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":190416,"name":"Arlen Patricia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Arlen es una joven de mucha iniciativa, lleva varios a\u00f1os  administrando su  negocio la venta de ropa de segunda  mano y cosm\u00e9ticos el cual inicio con el apoyo de su esposo proveniente de su trabajo como alba\u00f1il, solo tiene un hijo el cual esta peque\u00f1o, su mayor objetivo es poder mejorar su peque\u00f1o cuarto ya que tiene poco espacio el cual espera poder hacer un aumento para tener mejor comodidad.

She is 33, married, and has a six year old daughter. To make money, Jazgul and her husband sell fruits and vegetables in the market. They have been doing it for ten years, and earn 15,600 soms per month. That profit made it possible for her to purchase some land in the village. With this loan, Jazgul wants to purchase fruits and vegetables (potatoes, cucumbers, strawberries) in order to resell them at a higher price in the market. In the future she wants to expand her business and save some money to purchase a flat.\r\n\r\nSagyndyk A., 70, is married. He has two daughters, and both of them work in a sewing workshop. Eight years ago, with the initial investment of 8,000 soms, Sagyndyk purchased ten goats. He resold all of them for 17,000 soms. And now, he hopes to obtain a loan to purchase cattle for breeding.\r\n\r\nNazira K. is the treasurer of the group. She is 43 and married. She has a daughter, who is 23 and works as a waitress. Nazira works as a nurse, and she also resells silver to make some money. She started this activity a year ago with the initial investment of 8,700 soms and now she makes 6,000 soms per month. Nazira applied for the loan, because she needs more money to purchase silver in order to increase the turnover of her business. In the future, she wants to expand her business and purchase a big house.\r\n\r\nAnarkan S. is 39 and married. She has two sons, and both of them are at school. In order to make money, Nazira works in a sewing workshop.

She has her own home in the center of the town of San Fernando de Kivinaki in the province of Chanchamayo (central forest).  She is a farmer and loves what she does, as it has allowed her to provide for her children.  On her cropland she grows yucca plant, plantain, beans, corn and citrus fruits.  \r\n\r\nShe is an expert at selling her produce since each harvest occurs in different months of the year, and she stays stocked this way.  And since she does not throw anything away, she also sells plantain leaves.  \"Selling the leaves is profitable, since each packet is worth 5 PEN and every two weeks I sell between 60 to 70 packets.\", she says.  She also buys and sells peanuts, which she purchases at 8 PEN and sells for 10 or 11 PEN.  The business is easy.  With the same effort and perseverance, Mar\u00eda wants to add to her crops and grow peanuts so she can give her children a better quality of life.  \r\n\r\nThis is her first loan through MFP and she is grateful for the support.

After cooking the breakfast which she takes to the farm, she supports her husband in his agricultural labors.  They have planted four sacks of seed, and hope to sow approximately 50 sacks.

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Mataniu has 3 years of experience in this business.  Mataniu needs a loan of WST $2250 to purchase additional seeds, seedlings & young crops to raise.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 tala or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures of a typical plantation in Samoa, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at: http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/SamoanPlantation\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Mataniu joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Mataniu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Mataniu T. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              1.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress.  The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation.  A higher number represents a higher score.  For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.  \r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She thanks you for your support. \r\n\r\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, where Sarita lives, clothing is made to order. Tailor stalls line streets and store owners sell material and use their sewing machines to turn those purchases into garments.

BPW borrowers use Kiva loans to buy cloth and\/or sewing machines that will increase their productivity and profitability. \r\n\r\nThis loan will be administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, the Patan Business and Professional Women. In 2007, Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal and now operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.

She and her husband Hern\u00e1n take care of their two children, Hilder and Melina, and live in harmony in their own home in the village of Patay.  Haydee engages in farming.  Her main crops consist of peas, beans, potatoes, flowers, and corn.  She has 12 years of experience.  What she enjoys most about her work is trimming the potato flowers since it signals that the harvest is approaching.  Her dedication to her land allows her to generate good earnings at the wholesale market in the city of Tarma where she sells her harvest.  However, she sells gladiola flowers at the central market in Lima.  Her plans are to plant gladiola flowers and maintain good conditions for planting beans so that she can produce good output at harvest time.  In addition, she has crops of corn that will bear fruit during the first few months of the upcoming year, which will secure her seasonal income.  \r\n<p>\r\nHaydee belongs to the Communal Bank \u201cLos Picaflores de Patay\u201d and is receiving her eighth loan from MFP, which has provided her good experiences that have helped to improve her crops.  With everyone\u2019s support, she hopes to continue her progress.  By obtaining assistance, Haydee will invest the money she requested in a bag of pea seeds and five sacks of natural fertilizers for the crop of corn that she planted a month ago.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":823763,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a bag of pea seeds and five sacks of natural fertilizers.

pursuing education. Mary lives with her husband and children in a community called Oda. A sizable number of the inhabitants are engaged in farming activities. However, quite an appreciable number of the women are involved in palm oil production. Mary is one of such women who actively produce palm oil. She has been in business for eight years. Her husband is a food-crop farmer.\r\n<p>\r\nMary buys the palm nuts from the local farmers in her community. She processes them in her house to produce the oil and sells at wholesale prices to her customers. Palm oil is a local vegetable oil produced from the meat of the palm nuts which has been cooked, pounded, sieved and boiled for hours.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":317933,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase bananas so as to increase her capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-13T15:19:58Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carolina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.56},{"due_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":55555.52}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.44},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":44.48}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:02:31Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010835},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-07-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63233121},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-08-25T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:53Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664912},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-09-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:46:47Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105624},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-10-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:27:25Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022736},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:49Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867977},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2009-12-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:45Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757178},{"amount":44.44,"local_amount":55555.56,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:29Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146290},{"amount":44.48,"local_amount":55555.52,"processed_date":"2010-02-21T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:55Z","rounded_local_amount":58737.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984452}],"funded_date":"2009-05-14T14:23:22Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T11:15:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":111749,"name":"Marciana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marciana S. comes from the village of Cebulin, Plaridel, Misamis Occidental.

Brigida and her husband have four school-aged children. To make a living, Brigida owns and operates a business venture in the food sector, making and selling food. The main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling snacks like banana and hot cakes in the local community. Brigida has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Brigida joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services. Her aim was to help improve her living situation and increase her ability to engage in business activities. Brigida is requesting a loan in the amount of 11,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make her products for sale. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Brigida from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n<p>\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n<p>\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of northern Mindanao.\r\n<p>\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has been in this business for nine years. She joined ASHI, a micro-finance institution and Kiva partner in the Philippines, in 2007. During the course of her membership, Priscilla has been a good performer: valued for her attendance at center meetings, repayments and business. She is now applying for her fourth loan, this time for 25,000 Philippine pesos, to obtain additional inventory of soft drinks. She is positive that with access to additional working capital through ASHI and Kiva, her dreams of an expanded business will be achieved. \r\n\r\n\r\n

She married husband Miguel 19 years ago, and together they have two children, ages 18 and 15. This happy family lives in their own home in the center of Kivinaki, province of Chanchamayo, Peru. Kivinaki is a place for growing fruit, such as oranges and tangelos, produce to which Vilma dedicates a lot of her time. She also grows avocados and bananas on a smaller scale. With this job she was able to educate her children, who also help her in the field. Care for her crops is constant, so she has to rely on workers to tend to her land. Her husband is a construction worker, so they both add to the family finances. And since Vilma is a nonconformist, she also spends time working as a kindergarten teacher in the community of Yaroni. \"I like to feel busy,\" she says proudly. \"What I do makes me feels good. I can provide my family what it needs to live in a decent way.\" In the future she would like to set up rooms in her home because she sees a lucrative business in renting out rooms. This will be her first loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she welcomes the support in advance. She feels content to belong to the \"Las Semillitas de Kivinaki\" community bank because she knows working together will produce better results. With the loan, she plans to hire workers for her orange and banana crops.

Sabina sees this as a business opportunity as she can target these people as potential customers. She also makes her products attractive by allowing her customers to pay in small amounts at a time. She has learned that not all of her clients can afford to buy these items for the full price at the time of purchase, but that they can pay her in small amounts over a two week period. Thus Sabina and her husband have created a business that is convenient and accessible to the community. They are seeking a loan to be able to purchase a larger variety of products for the upcoming Christmas season. They will use the profits to benefit their two children.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mifex offers its clients microinsurance and access to business training and educational programs.

Aleisa, where she lives,  is far from the town, so petrol is one of her daily expenses. She has an old van that she uses to transport her cabbages, cucumbers, spring onions and flowers to the market. Ana is old and not suitable for hard work like digging holes in the garden, and so she hires two boys from her neighborhood to dig the holes for her. She is on her seventh loan and has received $4,000. Ana is requesting this loan to fertilize her garden and improve her home.

Juan hopes to purchase another taxi to give himself some time to rest, to offer a better service to his customers, and to provide a stable family and economic situation for his youngest son. Juan's wishes for his sons is that they reach the goals that have set for themselves, and he feels very proud to know that his sons are able to overcome the obstacles they meet.  \r\n\r\nJuan sells various merchandise, and also owns a taxi. He started 15 year ago selling pants, shirts and underwear to friends and neighbors, and little by little increase the merchandise he offered and the number of customers. He saved part of the profits from the clothing sales to buy a taxi. Both businesses allowed him to support his sons, but the taxi has been the main source of income for his family. \r\n\r\nThe loan Juan is requesting  will be used a work capital. He needs to pay for repairs and maintenance for his vehicle and to invest in more clothing items to distribute among customers who have already placed orders. \r\n\r\nJuan is thankful to Kiva partners

and so is the sole income earner of the family. He has been farming for the last 22 years on his piece of land growing wheat, rice, tomato, cucumber and watermelon.\r\n\r\nRahmatullo would like to adopt new farming technology to boost his agricultural yield as he needs to be able to meet the financial responsibility of educating his children and maintaining his family. But he lacks the capital. He therefore requests a 4,000 Somoni loan to purchase seeds and fertilizer for growing his crops. He is very responsible and promises to repay the loan on time.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

He lives with this wife and children in the Faraba district of Bougouni City (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali). Not having gone to school, he got interested at an early age in income-generating work.  For ten years, he used to work daily with merchants, especially in merchandise transport by cart at the marketplace and in the different district of Bougouni, though he was unsuccessful.  So he decided to learn from his uncle how to sell various shop goods.  For four years now, he has been working at this business and is in high demand. \r\n\r\nTo bolster his business, he decided to collaborate with the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso.  He is now on his first individual loan, which he intends to use to buy various goods for his shop.  He stocks up in Bamako (capital of Mali).  His customers are composed of local people. \r\n\r\nWith this loan, he plans to realize a monthly profit of 40,000 francs CFA that he envisions using to expand his shop.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated

She is 32 years old. Elsie is married with 4 school-aged children. To make a living, Elsie owns & operates a business venture in the agriculture sector, raising crops. While not her only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for her business comes primarily from planting and harvesting corn for sale. Elsie has been engaged in her business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Elsie joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation as well as her ability to engage in business activities. Elsie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 10,000 PHP from GDMPC. Elsie is requesting a new loan of 12,000 PHP which will be used to purchase fertilizers such as manure. This loan will be the fifth loan taken out by Elsie from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay her children's tuition fees and save for future use. \r\n\r\nAbout GDMPC:\r\n\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines. It has four branches and three units offices covering the provinces of Zamboanga del Sur, Lanao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. Its membership is composed mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

He\u2019s married to Donata, 54, and they have three children who are all now independent.  This couple lives in their own home and most of their life is dedicated to potato farming.  He learned farming skills when he was very young from his parents who taught him how to be a good tuber farmer.\r\n\r\nDuring harvest time his wife helps him.  Generally, she tends to their animals like: sheep, cows, bulls, pigs and asses, an activity she\u2019s been in since they got married.  Selling animals has sheltered them from the economic crisis.\r\n\r\nWhat he enjoys the most about farming is harvesting potatoes and sorting them by size.  What annoys him are customers that try to cheat him on the price, so much work for so little economic reward.  He will continue planting but in larger amounts.  In addition, he will grow a variety of tubers like the native one and the colored ones that are in highest demand in the market.\r\n\r\nThis is his 4th loan with MFP and because he\u2019s familiar with the work methodology of his communal group he feels proud to be part of a unified group that\u2019s willing to get ahead and save in an organized fashion.\r\n\r\nHe will use the requested funds to buy several sacks of fertilizer to improve his tuber production.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":552316,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sacks of fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-12T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aniceto ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":1800,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:22Z","rounded_local_amount":1850.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326797}],"funded_date":"2010-06-26T08:16:47Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:37:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":210947,"name":"Teresita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresita V. is from the village of Tuburan in Cagayan de Oro City.

She lives in her own home, with her husband and their teenage son. Since over 7 years ago, she has sold household goods, vegetables and general groceries from the front room of her house. Her customers are the housewives from her neighbourhood, who appreciate the attentive service she offers them. Her store is the busiest in the area, so she stocks up with plenty of chicken, meat, vegetables and fresh fruit - perishable every day products. Lucia is happy with the business she has built: it is calm and enjoyable to work there, and at the same time she can take care of her home and her family's wellbeing.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, she hopes to grow and diversify her business - for instance she would like to have a bookshop, because no-one in her area is in that line of business. This is Lucia's 15th loan with [field partner] MFP, and she promises to make all her repayments on time as she has been doing up to now. She also looks forward to working with her companions in the communal bank. She will invest the loan she is seeking in buying products so that she can supply her customers' demands.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rosa Oswald, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1075,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1075,"image":{"id":584955,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy additional stock for her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-19T18:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1075,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1075,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":444.2},{"due_date":"2010-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":460.96},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":492.72},{"due_date":"2010-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":509.25},{"due_date":"2010-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":536.29},{"due_date":"2011-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":556.58}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":159.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":165.18},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":176.56},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.48},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.17},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":199.44}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":159.17,"local_amount":444.2,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:41Z","rounded_local_amount":446.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887493},{"amount":165.18,"local_amount":460.96,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:47Z","rounded_local_amount":462.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154494},{"amount":176.56,"local_amount":492.72,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:15:06Z","rounded_local_amount":494.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449804},{"amount":182.48,"local_amount":509.25,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:48Z","rounded_local_amount":511.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588501},{"amount":192.17,"local_amount":536.29,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:04:12Z","rounded_local_amount":538.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725010},{"amount":199.44,"local_amount":556.58,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:30Z","rounded_local_amount":559.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463097}],"funded_date":"2010-08-20T18:15:59Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:40:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rosa Oswald","image":null}},{"id":227336,"name":"Katy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cPROSPERIDAD\u201d; este banco est\u00e1 situado en el distrito de Huanchac en la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

This is 34-year-old Rukia R. from Mwanza. She is married with four children between the ages of 3 and 13 years old. Rukia has been running a tailoring business since 2005 making clothes for women. She works at the business for twelve hours per day, six days per week. She currently earns about $100 from her business.\r\n\r\nRukia is requesting a loan of $400 in order to purchase machines and to renovate her building. In the future, she plans to have her own house. Rukia thanks you for your support!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>ABOUT SELFINA: <\/b>\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

She lives with her family in their own home, and apart from her children she isn't responsible for supporting anyone else financially.\r\n\r\nAlzira left Maputo for Boane in 1991 to join her husband, and they still live there today. She has had her own business for more than 18 years and does not have any other employees. She works around 10 hours every day. Her husband is also a business owner and helps to pay the household expenses. Alizira earns approximately 5500.00 Meticales each month, which go towards paying the household expenses. She also saves some money at home in order to cover any unforeseen needs. \r\n\r\nAlzira had previously taken out loans with the credit cooperative TCHUMA but later decided not to continue for various reasons. She found out about Hluvuku [the Kiva Field Partner] one day when she was passing by the Institution, as she entered and found out about the options available there. This is her 3rd loan, for the amount of 25,000.00 Meticales. She will use this money to buy capulanas [long pieces of fabric that have various uses] in order to increase and diversify the products she sells. Her earlier loans were for 13,000.00 Meticales e 18,000.00 Meticales, and both were used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nShe promises to repay the loan as indicated in order to be eligible for other loans later. Her main project is the construction of small houses to rent out. In the future she would like to apply for more loans to put towards her business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Catherine Fountain, Kiva

During the afternoons she sells clothing and cosmetics. \r\n\r\nShe makes her sales through orders and her customers are people who are responsible in their payments\u2014she sells merchandise to them on credit. Julia is very happy with her sales because they have been very good during the 8 years since she has had this business. At first she lost her capital in this business, because of the credit she extended to people. Since then, when she has new customers she first asks for references in order to sell to them with assurance, or she sells to them for cash up front. \r\n\r\nHer greatest wish is to increase her capital and then buy a vitrine where she can show her merchandise. This is the twelfth loan that she has had with Microfinanzas Prisma, and she will continue being punctual in her payments because she would like to have more loans in the future. In her group she is a very responsible and respected member. She plans to invest the requested money in buying clothing merchandise, so she can continue making progress with her business.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":544146,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"She will buy clothing merchandise to stock her business ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosario ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":149.36},{"due_date":"2010-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":156.09},{"due_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":162.05},{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":169.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":178.04},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":184.87}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.28},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":56.72},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.35},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":62.32},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":64.7}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":52.28,"local_amount":149.36,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":150.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934569},{"amount":54.63,"local_amount":156.09,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:09Z","rounded_local_amount":156.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673342},{"amount":56.72,"local_amount":162.05,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:35Z","rounded_local_amount":162.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166887166},{"amount":59.35,"local_amount":169.59,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:21Z","rounded_local_amount":170.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154177},{"amount":62.32,"local_amount":178.04,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:00Z","rounded_local_amount":179.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449487},{"amount":64.7,"local_amount":184.87,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:34Z","rounded_local_amount":185.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588158}],"funded_date":"2010-06-06T13:58:10Z","paid_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:34Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jennifer Day","image":null}},{"id":206867,"name":"Petrona Del Carmen","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"la sra.

They have four children but only one of their daughters, who\u2019s a single mother and their grandson, Santiago, 4, who Leticia has cared for since birth because her daughter was still in school and is now working as an Accountant, lives with them.\r\n\r\nLeti is asking for her loan to invest in her fine jewelry (gold) business.  She stocks up in the city of Morole\u00f3n, Guanajuato, because she gets good prices there because she\u2019s been a customer there for 12 years.  She is then able to raise prices just a little and not be forced to sell her jewelry for prices that are too expensive.  She comments that she is really putting in much effort into her work because she wants her son, who is studying Law, to finish his career and be able to buy him the textbooks he requires.\r\n\r\nOne of her goals for right now is to acquire customers and sell to people who won\u2019t fall back on their payments, above all to people who have stable employment.  One of her dreams is to rent a locale that she can set up shop in because it\u2019s quite dangerous to be carrying fine jewelry in the street. Another one of her dreams is to be able to repair her house because in the rainy season there are leaks.\r\n\r\nElvia B. L\u00f3pez is also part of the \u201cLAS AUDACES\u201d group.  She is 43 years old and finished 8th graD..  She comments that she was unable to finish her education because her parents didn\u2019t have enough money to continue paying her school costs.  Elvia is married to Lemuel who sells animals like sheep and cows.  They have 6 children but only one of them, named Ricardo who works with his father and helps sell the animals, lives with them.\r\n\r\nShe sells catalogue beauty products like creams, cosmetics, etc.  She also sells women\u2019s lingerie by catalogue.  She has been in this business for about 6 years.  She decided to go into it to help her husband meet their children\u2019s expenses because there was a time when they were all in school and they had to pay tuition and rent in other cities where they were studying.  Elvia is asking for her loan to invest in lingerie and cosmetics to have stock on hand and not have to place orders because this is time consuming.\r\n\r\nThe other 10 members are: Ma. Guadalupe Jim\u00e9nez Rojas, Irma M. Andr\u00e9s, Ma. Maribel V\u00e1zquez Araujo, Yolanda M. Vilchis, Avelina L. Morales, Amalia D. L. C. Colector, Jhovanna Elizabeth Guzm\u00e1n Flores, Ver\u00f3nica Vel\u00e1zquez Araujo and Viridiana M. Lorenzo.  They want the loan to invest in catalogue shoe sales, catalogue natural medicine sales, clothing sales, Internet caf\u00e9, nutritional club, etc.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4250,"image":{"id":659290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Jewelry","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy fine jewelry.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"ZITACUARO, ESTADO DE MICHOAC\u00c1N","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-12-08T19:20:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":4250,"lender_count":127,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They have four young children and live in their own home in the town of San Pedro de Cajas.  She is an enterprising woman who started growing \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lepidium_meyenii\" target=\"_blank\" >maca<\/a>\u201d five years ago since it is a prized crop.  The land on which she plants is in a remote part of her community that is beautiful and spacious.  At first Eulalia sold her crop to brokers who transported her product to the city of Jun\u00edn.  After she determined that the \u201cmaca\u201d she produced was of good quality, Eulalia received an offer to sell her harvest to a beverage processing company in Lima that uses this product.  Since then, she began investing in her crop in order to improve its quality.  Eulalia earns a yearly net income between 9000 to 10,000 PEN.  For this reason, she plans to open her own \u201cmaca\u201d processing company so that she can expand her business and generate more earnings in the short term.  \r\n<p>\r\nEulalia is a member of the Communal Bank \u201cCoraz\u00f3n de San Pedro\u201d (Heart of San Pedero) and this will be her third loan with MFP.

She increased her \u201cmaca\u201d sales orders this year, but her crop has yet to be harvested.  This is why she is requesting assistance.  Eulalia will invest the money she requested in the hiring of workers to help harvest the \u201cmaca\u201d.  \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":844640,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to hire workers to help with harvesting.

She plans to use the profit from her business (estimated to be 300 talas or US $125 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family. She and her husband have raised seven children.\r\n \r\nIn 2010, Fofoa joined SPBD* to gain access to financial services. Most of SPBD's clients are unable to borrow from commercial banks because they lack collateral. This is Fofoa's second loan with SPBD. \r\n \r\n*SPBD evaluates the living conditions of each of its borrowers. Generally, a loan manager evaluates a variety of social metrics on a scale out of 3 (the higher the number, the better off the person is) and these are averaged for the \"overall social metric score.\" For example, a 3 out of 3 on \"level of education\" would mean that the borrower has graduated from university.  \r\n\r\nAbout SPBD:\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.
