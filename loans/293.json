tiene 42 a\u00f1os, vive junto a su esposo y a sus hijos en su casa propia. Con mucho esfuerzo ha logrado que toda su familia tenga su negocio propio de venta de productos l\u00e1cteos y otras variedades de alimentos, es por ello que juntos preparan el yogurt que es todo un proceso de aproximadamente 60m litros por semana, tienen clientes fijos, como una escuela t\u00e9cnica de polic\u00edas que siempre consumen sus productos por la calidad que han demostrado tener en la producci\u00f3n, esto anima bastante a Rosa que tambi\u00e9n ha incursionado en hacer n\u00e9ctares y panecillos, lo que es algo dif\u00edcil por no disponer de un horno panadero, ya que a veces el horno que alquila le env\u00eda los panecillos quemados, por lo que Rosa se ha propuesto implementar su cocina. Es la  cuarta vez que solicita un pr\u00e9stamo con MFP, demostrando ser muy puntual en sus pagos de devoluci\u00f3n de  capital, adem\u00e1s Rosa tiene gran habilidad trabajar en equipo, como lo hace en su banco comunal. En esta oportunidad, el dinero requerido es para comprar un horno y mejorar su producci\u00f3n de pasteles, as\u00ed como en la elaboraci\u00f3n de los yogurtes y n\u00e9ctares. El horno est\u00e1 valorizado en aproximadamente 2000 soles y  con lo que resta comprar\u00e1 mayor cantidad de insumos e ingredientes.","en":"Rosa is 42 and lives with her husband and children in a house which they own. Through a lot of hard work, the family has succeeded in building their own business, which sells dairy products and other types of foods. They produce about 60 liters of yogurt every week.  They have regular clients, including a police academy that always selects their products because they know they are high-quality.  Rosa is very inspired by this and now she is also trying her hand at making nectar drinks and baking loaves of bread, which is difficult because she does not have a bread oven. Sometimes the oven she rents burns the loaves, so Rosa is considering installing one of her own. \r\n\r\nThis is the fourth loan Rosa is requesting from MFP, and she has been very prompt with her repayments. Rosa is also very good at working with a team, as she does with her village bank. She plans to use this loan to buy an oven, so she can improve her baking proces, and to support her yogurt and nectar drinks production.  The oven will cost about 2000 soles.  The rest will go toward supplies and ingredients.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jill Heske, Kiva

She is single and enjoys trading, the business through which she make a living. Rita lives at a family house at Kwahu Da in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Most of the inhabitants are either into farming or trade in farm products. Very few people run other types of businesses. \r\n<p>\r\nRita trades in second-hand textiles. She buys textile fabrics and all kinds of second-hand clothes, including bedspreads, ladies clothing and menswear, from Kumasi, a nearby city. She then sells them in the market square of her community. She says she also treks to nearby markets to sell. \r\n<p>\r\nRita has been in this business for eight years and wants a loan to increase her working capital so that she can buy textiles in bales. She also prepares and sells banku (fermented corn dough) in her community to beef up her income.

Previously she had asked for a loan to buy things, and it was of great help.  She started this business ten years ago.  She needed to find a way of life to get ahead in spite of the difficulties like competition, because sometimes her customers find products at a more favorable price.\r\n\r\nThe loan she is asking for is to buy the raw material that is necessary for her business and to attract her customers.  Her wish is to get a stand at the market where she can offer her products in a more dependable way. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":473420,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2010-01-20T18:40:16Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":818.18},{"due_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":818.18},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":818.18},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":818.18},{"due_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":818.18},{"due_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":818.18},{"due_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":818.18},{"due_date":"2010-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":818.18},{"due_date":"2010-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":818.18},{"due_date":"2010-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":818.18},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":818.2}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.9},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.91},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.91}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":40.91,"local_amount":818.18,"processed_date":"2010-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:33Z","rounded_local_amount":854.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123912213},{"amount":40.91,"local_amount":818.18,"processed_date":"2010-03-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:34Z","rounded_local_amount":854.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130493477},{"amount":40.91,"local_amount":818.18,"processed_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:19:26Z","rounded_local_amount":854.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136676337},{"amount":41.13,"local_amount":822.62,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:18:25Z","rounded_local_amount":859.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710704},{"amount":40.69,"local_amount":813.74,"processed_date":"2010-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:39:20Z","rounded_local_amount":849.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152045980},{"amount":40.9,"local_amount":818.18,"processed_date":"2010-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:44:13Z","rounded_local_amount":854.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159761194},{"amount":40.91,"local_amount":818.18,"processed_date":"2010-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:15:50Z","rounded_local_amount":854.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166848178},{"amount":163.64,"local_amount":3272.74,"processed_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-16T08:48:23Z","rounded_local_amount":3418.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172256159}],"funded_date":"2010-01-20T20:09:42Z","paid_date":"2010-10-16T08:48:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":174012,"name":"Juliana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Juliana is a 32-year-old widow with two children who attend school.

She didn't like this idea very much because she was a bit shy, but her attituD. changed when she went through a separation from her former partner, and due to this, she had to work for the sake of her daughter who was still very young. She did this alone, because her father had died, and this led her to the decision to work as her father had taught her. \r\n\r\nIt was not easy at first, because there were not many buyers, and sometimes the merchandise was ruined because of the national strikes or landslides and mudslides (avalanches) in the area, so that the products she carried from the mountains to the cities were spoiled. However, she persisted and kept working hard until she became well-known in the neighborhood where she sells her products. This has helped her to support her mother and her daughter, whom she tries to give the best education possible. She has bought a small plot of land in a settlement that will soon be constructed. For the moment, she has set up a small wooden house. Having a sales stand of her own is one of her distant goals, which she hopes to achieve with the income from this work. She needs to keep investing in this business to achieve her goals, and it is for this reason that she needs the loan. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva

was born in 1949. He is married and a father of four children who are all above the age of 15. Despite being born into poverty, lacking education, and losing his parents at an early age, Emmanual aims to become a very rich man and give his children the good education they need to get ahead.\t\r\n       E. became a member of GHAPE in 2006 and has successfully repaid two loans. He invested his loans to sell maize and bought a maize mill which produces flour.\r\n\r\nE. started farming crops in 1975, and recently starteed buying and renting a few houses around his neighborhood. In the two years since joining GHAPE, he has dramatically increased his fortunes. His first loan helped him to buy his first corn mill (which costs about 350,000 CFA or $875), and the second loan from Kiva, together with his profits from previous business, helped him to buy his second corn mill. Corn mills are in demand in every community around Bamenda, as corn is sold in kernels and every person must take their corn to be milled before they can prepare \u201ccorn fufu\u201d \u2013 a local favorite. \r\n\r\nI asked E. how he is able to farm and operate mills in two locations, and like a modern-day businessman, he operates from a distance. He pays the rent for two shops in two busy markets and hires two young men to operate the mills. With the two mills now operating, he says he is able to earn as much as 100,000 CFA ($250) per month. \r\n\r\nHis profits from the mills have allowed him to expand his business activities into livestock. Since starting the second mill, he has been able to purchase three piglets and two cattle. His dream for the future is to start a full cattle farm. He says that he already has enough land for a herd of fifty cattle, and he has recently obtained two required grazing permits. A future loan will enable him to begin to build his herd.\r\n\r\nE.\u2019s income allows him and his wife, a civil servant working with the government, to give their four children an enviable education. His eldest is studying in a university in France, made possible in part by a scholarship. Two others are in university in Cameroon. And the youngest is in secondary school. Between the four, E. and his wife pay over 500,000 CFA ($1,250) in annual school fees and expenses. \r\n\r\nE. says that without his new business ventures, he and his wife would really be struggling with the expense of providing their children with such an income. Thus, he is very grateful to those who have financed his loan: \u201cIt is a pleasure to learn that so many around the world are contributing to my family\u2019s wellbeing,\u201d he says, \u201cand we send them our thanks.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe plans to repay this loan in 18 months and the first installment repayment begins four months after

In this business, she still does not earn enough income to support her household.  In order to improve her living, she decided to ask for a loan to buy three piglets to start breeding pigs.  Mrs. Pien H. is a 34-year-old widow with a child that helps the mother's business. \r\n\r\nSeven members in this group have end-of-term loans, and the rest have monthly payment loans.  Members with end-of-term loans are not required to pay any principal on their loans until the very end of the loan term.  End-of-term (EoT) loans are AMK\u2019s main product because it is the most beneficial to Cambodia\u2019s poor.  It allows them to repay portions of the principal whenever they are financially able to.  Most clients start making payments several months before the end of their loan term, and almost all of AMK\u2019s clients make their payments on time.

Sanabar is 46 years old. She works purchasing and reselling cows with her children. She has five children. \r\n<p>\r\nSanabar would like to request a loan of $1000 USD for a term of 12 months in order to purchase additional cows to increase her inventory and meet customer demands. She believes this will lead to greater revenue and, ultimately, greater profit for her family. In the future, she would like to reinvest the earnings generated by this loan back into her business to purchase additional cows and increase her income further. She plans to use the increased income to fund her children\u2019s education. You could become an important part in Sanabar family's life, and she deeply appreciates the trust and support you are giving her. \r\n<p>\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p>\r\nTajikistan is one of the poorer of the 15 former Soviet republics, with a GDP per capita of less than $600. The civil war, which took place soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., severely damaged the already weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in agricultural production and the manufacturing sector.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  All of these factors have resulted in a severe lack of jobs and have forced hundreds of thousands to leave Tajikistan to find work in other countries, mostly in Russia.  While Tajikistan has experienced some economic growth since the end of the Civil War, nearly two-thirds of the population still lives in abject poverty. \r\n<p>\r\nIMON International's mission is to promote sustainable economic development and improved quality of life in Tajikistan by insuring reliable access to financial services for the economically active members of the population. IMON International has 8 branch offices throughout Tajikistan, and its entrepreneurs work in many parts of the country's economic sector, including trade, manufacturing, agriculture, and services. As of October 2008, IMON International had 27,802 active clients and a total portfolio of $28,405,549.  Approximately 44% of these clients are women and 65% are from rural areas.

She lives in her own home together with her husband Hugo, 50 years old, and their 4 children. They are the reason for all their efforts. Sarita's work is to harvest carrots, potatoes and sweet peas. She works alongside her husband who has also worked very hard to provide their kids with a good education. She has seen it profitable to go to Bolivia with her products as they become available. That is where she gets the best prices. She makes sure to provide only the best care of her plantations, warding against insects and fertilize as needed.  In time she hopes to increase her productivity so that her sales will be better and her earnings increase. This is her tenth loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner). She is committed to making her payments on time, not wanting to cause any problems to her community group colleagues, where she is very well liked. With the two thousand five hundred soles she requests she will purchase more fertilizers for her fields and she will hire the help she needs in the plantations. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":900,"image":{"id":593274,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-02T13:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sarita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":381.55},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":395.02},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":408.97},{"due_date":"2010-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":423.4},{"due_date":"2011-01-03T08:00:00Z","amount":438.35},{"due_date":"2011-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":452.71}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":137.36},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":142.21},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":147.22},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":152.43},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":157.8},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":162.98}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":137.36,"local_amount":381.55,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:17Z","rounded_local_amount":383.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154567},{"amount":142.21,"local_amount":395.02,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:14:32Z","rounded_local_amount":397.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449879},{"amount":147.22,"local_amount":408.97,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:00:43Z","rounded_local_amount":411.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588581},{"amount":152.43,"local_amount":423.4,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:05:03Z","rounded_local_amount":426.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725083},{"amount":157.8,"local_amount":438.35,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:45Z","rounded_local_amount":441.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463183},{"amount":162.98,"local_amount":452.71,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:38Z","rounded_local_amount":455.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195886589}],"funded_date":"2010-09-08T15:44:32Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:52:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":231869,"name":"Virginia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Virginia B. is from the village of Tambagan, Medina, Misamis Oriental.

Talacagay, Hinoba-an, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by operating 3 business ventures: general store, livestock, and farming. Her husband Fortunato A., who is 58 years old, raises livestock and farms to earn his living. They have 1 child who is already married at 25.\r\n\r\nLolita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lolita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000 helped her increase her monthly profit to PHP 11,000, uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 7th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,000, which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell in her General Store so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs. Lolita A. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

After finishing selling the milk, she tends to her grocery shop business.\r\n  \r\nZubaida has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah for her dairy business. With the loan, she will buy another buffalo.  That will help her increase the milk quantity and fulfill the demands of more customers. \r\n\r\nShe hopes that this loan investment will help her business grow further and she will be able to provide better facilities in life to her family.

He has been in this business for eight years and he considers the most difficult part of his work to be transporting his crops from his community to the storage warehouses in the towns of Quimbiri and San Francisco.\r\n\r\nOrlando will use the loan he has requested to buy materials with which to refurbish his home.  Over time, he hopes to be able to put together enough money to buy new land so that he can then leave them to his beloved children as an inheritance.  This will be Orlando's first loan and he is very happy to know that he will have the support of each of you and thereby be able to make progress.  He will use his 3,000 soles to buy building supplies with which to refurbish his home."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1100,"image":{"id":866623,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"to buy building supplies to improve the infrastructure of his home","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-09-13T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orlando ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-25T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":206.28},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":213.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":217.91},{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":228.6},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":234.07},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":242.54},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":255.25},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":260.55},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":271.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":278.76},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":291.29},{"due_date":"2012-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":299.92}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.64},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.28},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.9},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":83.82},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.83},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.93},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.59},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.53},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":99.49},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":102.21},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":106.81},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":109.97}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":77.22,"local_amount":210.61,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:47:39Z","rounded_local_amount":210.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232851308},{"amount":76.7,"local_amount":209.17,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:57:36Z","rounded_local_amount":209.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238666492},{"amount":346.97,"local_amount":946.28,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:32:14Z","rounded_local_amount":946.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385532},{"amount":90.66,"local_amount":247.25,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:28:04Z","rounded_local_amount":247.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098616},{"amount":91.4,"local_amount":249.28,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-16T08:48:40Z","rounded_local_amount":249.35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283201947},{"amount":202.95,"local_amount":553.51,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T09:48:15Z","rounded_local_amount":553.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287097741},{"amount":214.1,"local_amount":583.9,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:11Z","rounded_local_amount":584.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301455242}],"funded_date":"2011-09-27T13:31:24Z","paid_date":"2012-09-15T10:55:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":338432,"name":"Ligia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Despu\u00e9s D. convertirse en madre cabeza D. hogar, Ligia se dedic\u00f3 a trabajar incansablemente para sacar adelante a sus 4 hijos, d\u00eda a d\u00eda se rebusca la manera D. generar ingresos que le permitan mejorar su calidad D. vida, por ello, desD. hace alg\u00fan tiempo se dedica a la cr\u00eda D. cerdos y pollos, y como ingreso adicional venD. arepas a sus vecinos y allegados.\n\nPara continuar con este negocio y esperando ampliar sus clientes, Ligia necesita un pr\u00e9stamo para comprar 2 cerdos, cuido para los cerdos y pollos para el engorD.

is a 36 year-old woman from the small town of Monte Mercedes. Her husband\u2019s name is Rogelio Sequec and she has five children. She shows herself to be a very good mother, which is demonstrated by the fact that when she married, she also adopted as her own her husband\u2019s two children from a previous marriage. Of her own five children, four are currently studying. \r\n<p>\r\nShe only made it to third grade and couldn\u2019t continue studying because she had many brothers and sisters. Her father preferred that only the boys study until sixth grade, and she was destined to work in the kitchen with her mother. On occasion, her father would take her to the fields to help out with the corn crop and to do other agricultural work. \r\n<p>\r\nWhen she was 22 years old, she married and moved to the town of Concepci\u00f3n, Solol\u00e1, which is where she lives now. She works with her family to grow onions and they also have a small store. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>Loan:<\/b> Rosita says that being able to invest capital in her business has been one of the best things that has happened to her. She realized that the amount she received almost seven months ago has made a difference in her business. She has been able to supply her store better and her sales have increased accordingly. The amount she is currently requesting is Q. 4,000.00 Guatemalan Quetzals (approx. $450.00).\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Dreams:<\/b> When asked about her dreams, she responds with tears in her eyes\u2026 \u201cI don\u2019t want my children to suffer like I have suffered from not knowing many of the things one learns in school. For this reason, my husband and I have decided to help our children get ahead, so that someday they won\u2019t have to work in the fields like we have had to do, because it is very hard work.\u201d\r\n<p> <b> Translated from Spanish by Jennifer Day, Kiva Volunteer. <p><\/b>\r\n<p>Rosita, es una mujer de 36 a\u00f1os de edad originaria de la aldea Monte Mercedes, esposa de Rogelio Sequec, madre de cinco ni\u00f1os y demuestra ser muy buena madre ya que cuando se caso tambi\u00e9n adopto como propios a dos hijos de su esposo de un matrimonio anterior, de sus cuatro hijos propios cuatro est\u00e1n actualmente estudiando<\/p>\r\n<p> Ella \u00fanicamente alcanzo el primer grado de primaria pero ya no pudo continuar debido a que eran muchos hermanos y el padre prefiri\u00f3 darles estudio \u00fanicamente a sus hijos varones hasta sexto de primaria y ella fue destinada a trabajar con la madre en la cocina y en ocasiones el padre se la llevaba al campo a trabajar en el calzado de la milpa y algunos otros trabajos agr\u00edcolas<\/p> \r\n<p>A los veintid\u00f3s a\u00f1os se caso y se traslado al municipio de Concepci\u00f3n, Solol\u00e1 en donde vive actualmente y se dedica junto a su familia al cultivo de cebolla, a la administraci\u00f3n de una peque\u00f1a tienda<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>CREDITO: Ella manifiesta que el brindarle un capital para su negocio ha sido una de las mejores cosas que le ha pasado, pues ella se da cuenta que con el monto que recibi\u00f3 hace casi siete meses ha visto un progreso en su negocio, ha podido surtir mejor su tienda y ve que las ventas igualmente han mejorado much\u00edsimo.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets; thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":427725,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pharmacy","sector":"Health","themes":null,"use":"To purchase medicines in bulk ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-11-18T13:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Helena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":66666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:45:58Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757672},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:35:05Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146766},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:39Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984911},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:14Z","rounded_local_amount":71825,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015584},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":66666.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:02:53Z","rounded_local_amount":71825.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136740590},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":66666.65,"processed_date":"2010-05-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:24Z","rounded_local_amount":71824.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773704}],"funded_date":"2009-11-18T15:16:46Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lorne Warwick","image":215175}},{"id":157479,"name":"Tsengel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tsengel J. is a 21-year-old woman who lives with her parents and two youngest siblings in Bayanhongor Province, one of Mongolia's central provinces.

","en":"The \u201cLas Bendecidas\u201d (The Blessed Ones) is represented by Amparo and made up of 14 members who are in their second loan cycle.  They have shown unity, responsibility and the desire to continue growing to get ahead and make more progress every day.\r\n\r\nAmparo C. P. (group president) has a cosmetics sales business.  Thanks to her efforts, she continues to move forward in her work day to day.  She has two children and is separated from her husband.  Because of this, she overcomes obstacles in order to get her children ahead in life.  \r\n\r\nShe\u2019s a hard-working woman and has shown herself to be very responsible.  She lives under the anticretico modality (a transaction not available in the U.S. whereby a property owner requests a \"loan\" from you in exchange for housing, which must be paid back to you at the end of your contract. If your loan is not repaid, the property owner loses the property to you) and dreams with having her own home for her and her two children.  Amparo is making a great effort to reach this goal.  She will use the funds as working capital to continue growing in her business.\r\n\r\nAll the members of this group are multifaceted; they enjoy work very much.  Some sell food; others sell groceries, chickens, soft-drinks and turnovers.  Some sell milk, others vegetables. Some sell maja blanco (a sweet).  In this case, competition is non-existent because they all have different businesses and they all do well because they go out to different points of sale both within the city and to its outskirts in order to sell their merchandise. \r\n\r\nThe funds will be used to increase their ingredients, supplies and products in order to generate better income and meet customer demand.\r\n\r\nThe members already have quite a bit of experience in the field of group loans.  This is an established, very good group.  They completed their first loan cycle well with us and, to date, continue to prove themselves as being very hard-working and responsible people.

She is currently on her 13th loan cycle. She is 41 years old, divorced and the mother of seven children: four of them attend school, one is trained as a mechanic and two are too young to go to school. It is worth noting that she provides only for her children, because her ex-husband has completely left her.\r\n\r\nMasika's business consists of small-scale production of the traditional drink \"Mandrakwa\", which is made from corn with local technology. She began this activity with a start capital of US$60, just after the eruption of Nyiragongo Volcano in January 2002 had destroyed the whole economic infrastructure in the city of Goma. Thus she produced for 8 years \"Mandrakwa\" in her traditional production style.\r\n\r\nShe came to the microfinance institution Hekima and applied for this loan, which she will use to buy 32 sacks of corn to bolster her production capacity and increase her turnover. In addition, she wants to open a small store and buy a minibus for city transportation, since her oldest son has just finished his apprenticeship in automobile mechanics.\r\n\r\nMasika is thankful to MFI Hekima for the loans granted to her without any physical guarantee, because these loans enabled her to provide for her children and gradually build up some savings for her family.\r\n\r\nThis group is composed of 12 members, 11 women and 1 man, all pictured.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Robert Mouris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4100,"image":{"id":518540,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Liquor Store \/ Off-License","sector":"Food","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy 32 sacks of corn","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CD","country":"Congo (Dem.

Abdul is 41 years old and married.  He has five children between the ages of 3 and 16 years old.  His oldest four children go to school.  Abdul also supports his 20-year-old sister-in-law, who lives with the family.  Abdul started selling used clothing about ten years ago, and with the help of past loans from Tujijenge Tanzania, he now focuses on selling second-hand shoes.  Abdul has repaid all of his loans, and his business is going well.  He earns a profit of about US$ 150 per month.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, Abdul plans to buy about 50 pairs of second-hand shoes for his shop.  He will select men's and women's shoes, sandals and boots.  With the profits, Abdul will continue to support his family and pay for food and school fees.  He hopes to reinvest additional savings into his business, and eventually open up a second location in the busy Kariako market of Dar Es Salaam. \r\n\r\nAbdul is the chairman of the Mpapai group.  The group's 17 members run a variety of businesses including salons, shops, tailoring, and charcoal sales.

In the morning she sells her merchandise in an elementary school.  In the afternoons she does the same work at a high school.  She generally sells dishes of food and sweets during the students\u2019 recess.  She makes these dishes with great care because her main customers are minors.\r\n\r\nThe business is well received, and it is growing.  That is why she believes that it is fitting to expand it with the purchase of more supplies.  Then she could prepare more dishes and increase her sales in order to achieve her goal.\r\n\r\nShe believes that is advisable to request a loan from Edpyme Alternativa for 2,000 soles, which will help her meet her objective.\r\n\r\nJuan is a responsible and honest woman.  She has previously worked with our institution, and she has demonstrated punctuality and responsibility with her payments. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva

They have seven children who are 4 to 21 years old. \r\n\r\nLeonora joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she wanted something better for her family. With the help of her past 14 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, and by the sweat of her brow, Leonora has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty. Her previous loan of 19,500 Philippine pesos (PHP) helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, improving her family's standard of living. This time, for her 15th loan, she is borrowing PHP 19,500, which she intends to use as additional capital for her fishing vending business and for fishing materials so that she can continue to save up for future home repairs.

She is married to Nonito, a salesman, and has three children. Together they manage their household while operating the business. She is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nEufemia operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling by the piece. Aside from this she also sells cooked meat for additional income. Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of Php200 in sales every day.     \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operating her business, she is requesting a Php8,000 loan. She will use it to buy groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her inventory. She expects a boost in her income as she expands her business. \r\n\r\nEufemia hopes her business grows in the coming years and dreams to be able to give her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work.

This is because her husband's income is not enough to pay for daily expenses, although all of Wayan Ratih's children are already married. To expand her pig farming business, Wayan Ratih borrowed capital from Dinari to buy pig feedsock to increase her pig population, and the rest to buy pig feed. After raising 4 pigs for 4 months, Wayan Ratih sold it for Rp 2,300,000 (Translator\u2019s note: 1 US$ fluctuates between Rp8,000-9,500.00), and profit obtaines about Rp 500,000 for 3 pigs. From this profit, Wayan Ratih decide to continue for the next loan from DINARI so that her capital increased to buy pig feedstock. Wayan Ratih plans to buy 4 piglets for fattening to be raised for the next 4 months. She hopes that would bring more profit from the next sales, so that it would increase family's economy.\r\n<p><b>Translated from Bahasa Indonesia by Gwan Liong Ang, Kiva volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nMeskipun Wayan Ratih sudah berusia lanjut tetapi masih sangat bersemangat dalam menekuni usaha beternak babi. Hal ini dikarenakan penghasilan suaminya tidaklah banyak untuk bisa memenuhi kebutuhan sehari-hari meskipun anak-anak Wayan Ratih semuanya sudah menikah. Untuk mengembangkan usahanya beternak babi, Wayan Ratih meminjam modal ke DINARI supaya bisa membeli bibit babi untuk menambah populasi babi yang telah dimilikinya serta sisanya akan dibelikan pakan babi. Setelah memelihara 3 ekor babi selama 4 bulan, Wayan Ratih menjualnya seharga Rp. 2.300.000,- dan keuntungan yang diperolehnya sebesar Rp. 500.000,- untuk 3 ekor babi.

For many years she has done this kind of work, which she began because of the enormous needs which confronted her and her daughter, who has depended on her for her entire life. Mirna has had to work very hard to bring her up, since she is a single mother. She is applying for a loan so that she will be able to buy a bigger quantity of medicines, especially those for which people have the greatest demand, which is very important for Mirna, since in this way she satisfies her clients and assures herself that they will be her steady customers.

","en":"Juan is 20 years old, single and works in automotive repair and general mechanics. He and his brother work in the same shop. He left high school after his second year, choosing to work full time, which he has done for 5 years.  Juan is a very upstanding young man who is full of life. He enjoys his work and he approaches each day enthusiastically. He is passionate about fixing cars.\r\n\r\nAs far as income, he feels like he can't complain given that he and his brother share expenses associated with the rent and maintenance of their shop.   Juan sees the need to improve in his business by purchasing tools he lacks as well as other additional materials. The money from this loan will be put towards buying pliers, wrenches, various kinds of motor oil, filters, spark plugs, pistons, brake fluid, and antifreeze, among other items. Juan invested all of his capital specifically in improving the service provided in his business. At the shop, they do very good work which is why their clients come to them and know him and his brother very well, not to mention their father who also works in the automotive business, selling tires for all kinds of cars and trucks.   \r\n\r\nJuan tells us is that the greatest challenge he faces is himself, in striving to improve each day, continuing to learn and retaining his customers. He sees each day as another opportunity to improve and promote his business.   He has never lacked for work and for that reason he has recently been in the process of growing his business. Juan wishes to have his own garage, with the necessary and appropriate equipment to facilitate their work. He wants for other young people, like him, to learn this trade, instead of taking the easy rode of alcohol, thefts and drugs. He is willing to help other young people by teaching them so that they can become self-sufficient and offer assistance to their families to improve their lives.   \r\n\r\nOne of his hopes is that God will grant him health and more life so that he can one day own his own garage. With that gift, aside from just fixing cars, he could offer employment to other people. He would also like to have his own house and in the future have his own family, but not without having something to offer them.   He is grateful to those who are instrumental in providing his loan.

The Friendship Bridge is very proud to have this group in their team.<P>When I entered the house of Do\u00f1a Zoila A., our meeting place, I noticed that this group was very mixed.  There were a combination of Indigenous and Ladina (Indigenous and Spanish) women.  This combination gives the group a very special characteristic since each member brings different aspects from their cultures.  Not only that, but there are many types of businesses that these women are doing.  In this group, we will find women who will use their loan to raise animals, to purchase inventory for convenience stores, beauty salons, to sell pork meat, to sell hot dogs and refreshments and to run a funeral parlour.  Due to the variety of businesses, there is also a variety of personalities in this group such as women who are strong, brave, conservative, extroverts or shy. Even though, there is a lot of variety within the grup, they are still very unified.<P>\r\nThe women of \"Light and Life\" like the idea of working through communal banks because they feel that it unifies the women and motivates them. They also believe that it creates leadership within the group since problems are resolved through the board of directors. Last but not least, they love to work with the Friendship Bridge due to the low interest rates and for all the support they give to all the women in Guatemala.<P>The dream of all these women is to expand their business and to be profitable.  Others want to be able to send their children to college.  These women have already made a lot of progress, but they hope for more .

The Friendship Bridge tambi\u00e9n se siente orgulloso de tener este grupo en el equipo. \r\n\r\n<P>Al entrar a la casa de do\u00f1a Zoila A., el lugar de reuni\u00f3n, me di cuenta que este grupo era muy variado. Uno encontraba una combinaci\u00f3n de mujeres ind\u00edgenas y ladinas. Esta combinaci\u00f3n le daba al grupo una caracter\u00edstica especial al grupo ya que las integrantes llevan consigo los aspectos especiales de sus culturas. No solo eso, sino que tambi\u00e9n hab\u00eda una variedad de negocios. En este grupo podemos encontrar mujeres que van a invertir su cr\u00e9dito en crianza de pollo, tiendas de consumo diario, perfumer\u00eda, peluquer\u00edas, venta de carne de marrano, venta de hot dogs y gaseosas y una funeraria. Debido a esta variedad, uno pod\u00eda encontrar distintas personalidades dentro del grupo tales como mujeres aguerridas, valientes, conservadoras, extrovertidas o un poco t\u00edmidas. Sin embargo, a pesar de esta variedad la uni\u00f3n del grupo es inigualable. \r\n\r\n<P>A las mujeres de Luz y Vida les gusta trabajar bajo la metodolog\u00eda de bancos comunales porque ellas sienten que este estilo de trabajo promueve unidad entre las se\u00f1oras. Adem\u00e1s, creen que promueve liderazgo dentro del grupo ya que cualquier problema es avocado a la junta directiva. Finalmente, a ellas les gusta trabajar con The Friendship Bridge por los bajos intereses y por el apoyo constante que la instituci\u00f3n da a las mujeres guatemaltecas.\r\n\r\n<P>El sue\u00f1o de muchas de estas clientas es que su negocio se vuelva sostenible y as\u00ed ya no tengan que depender de una deuda para poder mantener su negocio. Otras quieren que sus hijos se grad\u00faen del colegio y de la universidad.

In this way, their children can have a better quality of life through better jobs. Wives, mothers, and micro entrepreneurs, these women are employed in activities such as: selling food, clothing, lottery tickets and newspapers, fashion, fruit, crafts, chicken; recycling; and managing restaurants. \r\n<p>\r\nThe loan is an important tool for these women to strengthen their small businesses. The loans will be reinvested in their businesses and the earnings will generate important savings. Today they are asking for a new loan that will be invested in various supplies, such as: fruits, vegetables, chicken, corn, fabrics, threads, plastics and cartons to recycle. They\u2019ll also buy ingredients to make fast food, like: meat, ham, cheese, eggs, flour, etc.\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by Sarah Bishop, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nEl Comit\u00e9 de Mujeres Emprendedoras es un programa desarrollado por Fundaci\u00f3n Paraguaya orientado a grupos de mujeres emprendedoras, las cuales crean una banca comunal y a trav\u00e9s de la misma reciben que asistencia crediticia.

She lives in Jr. Huascar in the Tarapoto district in the department of San Mart\u00edn, Peru. She's a 44-year-old married mother of three, all grown up and independent. She started with 50 soles and on her own initiative decided to start her business and began selling snacks at a local school. Currently she continues doing the same job and now has a specially arranged kiosk inside the school where she sells prepared food such as tamales, different rice dishes, candy and other snacks, fried bananas, popcorn, along with soft drinks, juices and other beverages. With the loan of 3,000 soles, which she plans to repay in six months, she will purchase products such as sacks of rice and sugar, gallons of oil, and packages of soft drinks for her daily food preparation. Her main customers are the students, teachers and administrators at the school, and she makes the decisions of what to do with the earnings.

With this loan of 500 soles, she will buy molds to make large and small panetones (loaf-like cake, typically served during holidays), which she will sell throughout the streets of Trujillo and to grocery stores in her district.  \r\n\r\nMaria dreams of having her own food stand where she can sell her snacks and panetones for Christmas. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn Malaby, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":175,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":175,"image":{"id":422567,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase molds to make large and small panetones.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Trujillo - La Libertad","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.115994 -79.02998","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-12-01T08:01:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":175,"lender_count":2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Concepci\u00f3n ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":175,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","amount":125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.75},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:08:09Z","rounded_local_amount":251.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110727812},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:06:10Z","rounded_local_amount":125.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118118186},{"amount":43.75,"local_amount":125,"processed_date":"2010-02-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:27Z","rounded_local_amount":125.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123953903}],"funded_date":"2009-12-01T08:43:14Z","paid_date":"2010-03-15T10:44:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":157512,"name":"Batdorj","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"S.

She has three children ages 7, 9 and 22, who are still in school. Martha and her husband run a small general store and a video game store. They initially started business by selling clothes on demand, but currently, they also own a video game room that has been growing, as they buy more video game equipment. She has taken advantage of every request she has made to Afodenic, as she can invent more with each loan she obtains. This is her fifth loan request, which she will use to buy miscellaneous products as well a phone switchboard, to provide her customers with a new service. She would also like to invest in school supplies. And, she would like to invest in more white meat, specially chicken, as it is largely consumed by people in Nigaragua because it is less expensive and healthier than other types of meat. In the long term, she would like to attract more customers and to be able to pay for school fees for her children.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jimena Lopez, Kiva

They are all high-school graduates; however, due to lack of financial resources, they were not able to pursue their college education.  \r\n<p>\r\nEdna wants to help her husband earn an income for their daily needs. She is now asking for a loan of PHP 9,000.00 for the maintenance of their passenger tricycle. Aside from their tricycle, she is also planning to invest some of the amount in her piggery and poultry-raising business. Her goal is to have a progressive business through the financial assistance that she would like to have.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe is wishing to have a better way of life by working hard. She believes that in every sacrifice, there is a reward ahead waiting, that is why she is doing her best to achieve her simple dreams. \r\n

Some years ago, she was able to buy a motorcar, with which her husband transports passengers. He also takes care of the vehicle and keeps it in perfect condition. Marily sells clothes in different places in the area by traveling; she has set her schedule so that she works from 6 in the morning to 6 in the evening. She says that working makes her feel useful. This young couple is fighting to overcome their problems and create a future, because their dream is to offer their children a good education. She has already gotten three loans from MFP, and what she likes most about her community bank is that her colleagues are calm and well-organized people. The money that she is requesting will be used to maintain and repair her motorcar, which will cost approximately 800 soles.

N\u00e3o responsabiliza se por ningu\u00e9m e consegue por m\u00eas poupar 2.000.00MT, porque conta com ajuda de 4 empregados.\n\nErasmo apos concluir o ensino m\u00e9dio (12 classe) n\u00e3o consegue ingressar na faculdade e com ajuda do seu pai que \u00e9 um grande agricultor, deu lhe uma parte de terra e ele inicia com a pratica de agricultura. A primeira cultura lan\u00e7ada foi o morango, mas porque ele tinha falta de um sistema de rega (gota a gota) que facilita nos regadios para a diversifica\u00e7\u00e3o das culturas, ele aproxima se a hluvuku solicitando um empr\u00e9stimo no valor de 25.000.00MT para aumentar o volume de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de mais culturas.\n\nAnos depois sai da casa dos seus pais alegando que vivia longe da sua machamba e que sofria roubos frequentes, ent\u00e3o passa a viver numa vivenda abandonada que foi dos seus avos. Tem como melhor produto o (feij\u00e3o verde, repolho, tomate e pepinos) gastando uma media de 35.000.00MT e tendo de lucro 50.000.00MT quando tem vendido a kilo e de 65.000.00MT quando tem vendido a grosso, pois n\u00e3o tem muitos gastos e assegura que as culturas cheguem a bom estado.   \n\nEste \u00e9 o terceiro empr\u00e9stimo de Erasmo na hluvuku e primeiro com kiva, o primeiro de 25.000.00MT foi usado para comprar um sistema de rega gota a gota e sementes para a machamba, o segundo de 45.000.00MT foi usado para aplicar na machamba, mas n\u00e3o teve muito sucesso devido \u00e0 falta de \u00e1gua e estes 25.000.00MT ser\u00e3o usados para o mesmo fim, est\u00e1 confiante que vai pagar antes do prazo determinado e pedir um outro empr\u00e9stimo para constru\u00e7\u00e3o de um armaz\u00e9m de luz difusa para armazenamento da semente da batata para fornecer semente ao n\u00edvel do distrito.\n\n\n","en":"Erasmo was born in the village of Nammacha in the frontier of Suazilandia, he is 32 years old and lives with his wife and they have two children who are 6 and 9 years old, they all go to school.  He is not responsible for anyone besides her family and gets an income of 2.000MT because he has the help of four employees.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing middle school (12 grade) Erasmo wasn't able to get into college and with his father's help who is a great farmer, and gave Erasmo a piece of his land, he started farming. His first produce was strawberry but because he didn't have any irrigation system (drop by drop) which enables diversification of produce, he contacted Hluvuku requesting a loan for 25.000MT to increase the volume of production.\r\n\r\nYears later this is his 3rd loan with Hluvuku and his first with Kiva, his first of 25.000MT was used to buy an irrigation system drop by drop for seeds of his farm, the second of 45.000MT was used for the farm, but wasn't very successful due to the lack of water and this new one for 25.000MT will be used for the same, he is confident he will be able to pay in the determined period of time and request another loan to build a warehouse of diffuse light to store potatoes seeds to provide seeds at district level.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated

She earns her living by fishing and fish vending.\r\n\r\nMarites\u2019s husband, Vito, is a fisherman, and they have 6 children who are between 3 mos and 20 years old. 5 of her children are currently going to school and also help their parents in the business as part of their daily chores.\r\n\r\nMarites joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their family income by engaging in fishing and fish vending. Now she earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nMarites is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 was used to fund operations of her fish vending and fishing businesses, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing, for her 16th cycle loan, the amount of PHP 15,000, which she intends to use on her business activities.
