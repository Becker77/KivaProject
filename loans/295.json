It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is a head of household who works tirelessly to improve the standard of living of his family, always looking for opportunities to help himself and his family get ahead.  For these reasons, he currently works selling wood at wholesale.  It is hard work, and involves first buying the eucalyptus trees so that later he himself can cut them down into smaller pieces of wood.  His primary tools are an electric saw and an axe.  Once Felix has finished cutting, he selects what he is going to move and the amount that will fit into his truck for transport.  Felix has been in this business for five years, and this actity has allowed him to support the education of his four children.  He also plants and tends to several crops, including potatoes, on his land.  Felix makes great efforts to see his family get ahead each and every day, which is why he always seeks opportunities that may help him in this endeavor.  He seeks a loan to buy more trees so he can take advantage of the upcoming winter season when trees are scarce.  He hopes to, in this way, stabilize his earnings and have the ability to produce a greater quantity of product to offer for sale. <p>\r\n\r\n<p><b> Translated from Spanish by Mary Lynn, Kiva Volunteer. <\/b><p>\r\n\r\nF\u00e9lix tiene 39 a\u00f1os de edad y vive con  su esposa  y 4 hijos.

Twelve years ago she was forced to learn how to take on the responsibility of obtaining an education for two children alone, something that was not an easy task. Thanks to her organizational skills and care she has been able to maintain stability in her home. Oiposho\u2019s great knowledge regarding her profession has allowed her to produce good quality and variety, but it has still not been enough. That is why she would like to make a greater investment in her land so that she can increase her income. She would like to earn enough to contribute to the costs of her children\u2019s education.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>Oiposho is requesting a loan of 2200 Somoni in order to purchase high quality seeds and fertilizer for her land. She appeals to the generous hearts of those who can grant her this assistance.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/p>\r\n<p>Tajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.<\/p>\r\n \r\n<p>But, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.<\/p> \r\n\r\n<p>IMON's History<\/p>\r\n<p>Since December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

With the help of her past 6 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Marilou has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 7000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 2500 per month,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 7th loan, she is borrowing PHP 9000, which she intends to use as additional working capital for her food vending business so that she could continue to save up for future education of her children.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are both responsible for paying back the loan of their fellow group member if she is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Y\u00ean H\u1eadu 2 nh\u00f3m 12 (Nh\u00f3m 12).\r\n\r\nL. is married and has four adult children. To making a living, she raises cattle for sale.

She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5.152.000 VND from SEDA which was used to purchase baby livestock to raise and sell. She is now requesting a new loan of 6.496.000 VND which will be used to purchase livestock feed and other supplies. The loan will be the second taken out by the borrower from SEDA.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, Western culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. A civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 percent of the country is mountainous and only seven percent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients have viable business propositions. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, meaning that Fabian and his family may fall sick and become unable to work or attend school.\n\nFabian works as a peasant farmer, but has also volunteered his time to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program that enables his community to drink safe water and stay healthy. Fabian and three other promoters in his community, including Benter, Pamela and Rose, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Fabian will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. Fabian wants to be a promoter because he believes that the dispenser system will prevent water-borne diseases.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce world carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Fabian\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1804183,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To reduce the burden of water-borne diseases by providing access to safe drinking water via chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fabian ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Benter ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Pamela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rose ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1800,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":450},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":600}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":1762,"name":"Klouyibo Ayawavi","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. A.

With the revenue from her small business she significantly contributes to meeting the needs of her home for the income of her husband is insufficient and too irregular to meet the needs of the family. As a skilful salesperson, she often calls on prospects to present new cloth ranges. The strategy works very well as evidenced by the growth of the activity over the past two years; however she lacks financial resources to meet the demand from her customers. As at now, the demand remains high thanks to the approaching end of year festive period. She therefore requested a new credit to meet the needs of her clients. \r\n\r\nThe amount requested is $850. It will allow her to build up a sufficient stock of loincloth for the end of year festive period. Mrs. A. Klouyibo Ayawavi has enough experience and talent to successfully run this activity. \r\n\r\n<p> \r\n\r\nMadame A. Klouyibo Ayawavi est n\u00e9e le 28 D\u00e9cembre 1972 \u00e0 Sotouboua. Mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de trois (03) enfants, elle prend en charge 3 autres enfants de proches parents. Analphab\u00e8te mais tr\u00e8s ing\u00e9nieuse, elle s\u2019est lanc\u00e9e tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t dans le commerce de pagne et d\u2019assiette. Avec les revenus de son petit commerce de pagne, elle contribue \u00e9norm\u00e9ment au besoin du m\u00e9nage car le revenu est non seulement tr\u00e8s insuffisant mais irr\u00e9gulier pour couvrir les charges du foyer. Tr\u00e8s commerciale, elle va souvent vers sa client\u00e8le pour lui proposer les nouvelles gammes de pagnes. Cette derni\u00e8re strat\u00e9gie fonctionne bien car l\u2019activit\u00e9 a pris de l\u2019ampleur ces 2 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, mais les moyens financiers lui font d\u00e9faut pour r\u00e9pondre aux demandes de sa client\u00e8le. Actuellement, la demande est encore tr\u00e8s forte car les f\u00eates de fin d\u2019ann\u00e9e s\u2019approchent. Ce qui  l\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 solliciter un nouveau cr\u00e9dit pour satisfaire sa client\u00e8le.\r\n\r\nLe montant de $850 sollicit\u00e9 servira \u00e0 constituer un stock suffisant de pagnes pour les f\u00eates de fin d\u2019ann\u00e9e. Madame A. Klouyibo Ayawavi dispose de beaucoup d\u2019exp\u00e9rience et de talent pour mener \u00e0 bien cette activit\u00e9.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":850,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":850,"image":{"id":4371,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy loincloth","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Tabligbo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.583333 1.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":22,"posted_date":"2006-11-14T17:34:59Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":850,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Klouyibo Ayawavi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2006-11-29T08:18:29Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":850,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":850,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2006-12-29T08:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-01-29T08:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-03-29T07:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-04-29T07:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":121.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":121.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":122,"local_amount":122,"processed_date":"2006-12-28T09:32:38Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-18T19:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":122,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":3722},{"amount":122,"local_amount":122,"processed_date":"2007-01-31T06:04:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-18T19:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":122,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5752},{"amount":122,"local_amount":122,"processed_date":"2007-01-31T06:04:54Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-18T19:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":122,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5760},{"amount":122,"local_amount":122,"processed_date":"2007-03-15T10:30:57Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-18T19:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":122,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10213},{"amount":244,"local_amount":244,"processed_date":"2007-05-15T09:15:25Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-18T19:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":244,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":16405},{"amount":118,"local_amount":118,"processed_date":"2007-06-15T09:16:04Z","settlement_date":"2007-06-18T19:48:46Z","rounded_local_amount":118,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":23207}],"funded_date":"2006-11-15T08:18:29Z","paid_date":"2007-06-15T09:16:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":5858,"name":"Mariama","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariama is 37 years old and married with 4 children.

She is married and has 12 adult  children.  To make a living, Selina owns and operates a business venture in the food sector making and selling food.  While not the only means of generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling ice cream in the local community.  Selina has been engaged in this business for over 1 year and earns approximately 300 WST a month from these activities.\n\nSelina joined SPBD to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Selina is requesting a new loan of 1000 WST which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale.  The loan will be the first loan taken out by Selina from SPBD.  Selina plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\n\nAbout SPBD:\nSPBD's mission is to improve the quality of life of people living in poverty in the poor island nations of the South Pacific.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based on a respect for each individual's innate human ingenuity, drive and self esteem.\n\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they all are responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is C\u1ea7u Gi\u1eefa 1 - Nh\u00f3m 03 (3).\r\n\r\nK\u1ef7 is married and has two school-aged children. To make a living, K\u1ef7 operates a store, selling animal feed and farm-related products in the local community. K\u1ef7 has been engaged in this business for over 10 years and earns approximately 5.000.000 Vietnamese Dong a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, K\u1ef7 joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. K\u1ef7 has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4.704.000 VND from SEDA. This previous loan was used to invest in expanding the business. He is now requesting a new loan of 7.392.000 VND, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the third loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA. K\u1ef7 plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of his family.\r\n\r\nAbout the other borrowers in the group:\r\n\r\n1.

She owns a business venture, selling a variety of different products in the local community.  Maria  has many years of experience in this business.  Maria  needs a loan of WST $1500 to purchase additional products to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 750 talas or US $313 per week) to financially support immediate members of her family.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Maria  joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Maria 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Maria Y. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She will also purchase feed for her pigs. This will be the eighth loan taken out by Amalia from CEVI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees her children and supplement her family's income. \r\n\r\nAbout CEVI:\r\n\r\nCommunity Economic Ventures, Inc (CEVI) has increased its portfolio significantly over the recent years. Based in Bohol, they have numerous branches throughout the Philippines.  In 2009, CEVI was awarded a CGAP silver award for transparency in social performance monitoring. CEVI not only provides credit for its clients but additionally savings, insurance, and training which are provided through regular cluster group meetings.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":545402,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizers, seeds and other farm inputs.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Banga, South Cotabato","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.423889 124.778333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":125,"posted_date":"2010-05-25T17:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Amalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":325}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":325,"local_amount":15000,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:27:50Z","rounded_local_amount":15150,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177385736}],"funded_date":"2010-05-25T19:06:05Z","paid_date":"2010-11-15T13:27:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":207464,"name":"Judith F.","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Judith F.

Jereza is borrowing PHP 15,000 so that she can purchase raw materials. This will be her sixth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 13,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Jereza aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

He lives in his parent\u2019s house, and although he is still very young, he already knows that if you want to have a good life, you have to work very hard. There\u2019s nothing better than a meal accompanied by a good wine, and Jes\u00fas knows this well. Enjoying the great variety of our cuisine, he sells wines of very good quality. He goes door-to-door in the hopes that people will buy his product. He likes to joke with his customers and is very friendly and fun. In the future, he would like to have a liquor store where he could sell more and offer a better variety to his customers. He already has three years in this business, and it\u2019ll soon be time to grow.  Jes\u00fas feels that the most difficult part of his job is convincing people to buy the wines, but he is not daunted and continues what he does, knowing that he is on the right path.

She decided to put up a business and have her own source of income.\r\n\r\nBecause of her dream for her family, Jocelyn engaged in selling different breakfast foods in the wet market where her husband works. From this she earned a small income that helped to defray some of their family expenses. She continued her food vending business but she also continued to look at other business opportunities because she believed that expanding to other businesses will help her increase her income. In 2006, she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon to access additional capital which she used to set up a general store near the community basketball court which has high pedestrian traffic.\r\n\r\nJocelyn has been in business for the past six years and now her entrepreneurial activities earn her a monthly income of PHP 12,500. This income goes to support the family's household expenses and the education of her children.\r\n\r\nIn her previous loan, Jocelyn borrowed Php 19,500 which she used as additional capital for her business. For her 10th loan she is proposing to borrow Php 21,000 to be used again as additional capital. Whatever income she gets from this loan will be used for her family and for school expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the call of not just a few, but thousands of women.

She lives with her parent and she want to help them with the household expenses.  With a lot of work and in spite of her young age she was able to win the contract for a small coffee shop in a medical center.  With the help of her parents, who had the contract before her, she has been able to equip it well and has hired individuals to help with the service.  The food that she serves is very good and therefore the personnel of the center often frequent her establishment.\r\nShe likes to keep her business very clean.  After 10 years in this activity, she finds attending to so many people at the same time the most difficult task.  Many times she and her helpers cannot cope with all the work.  In the future she plans to improve her facility thus being able to provide her customers with better service.  This is her first loan with MFP.  She know that she has to pay all the installments on time if she does not want to cause problems for the other members of her community bank, where she has been very well received.  She will use the thousand New Soles that she is requesting to buy the ingredients for the dishes that she prepares and sells in her coffee shop, this way she will begin to better supply her business.\r\n <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laura Bobbit, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":460573,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase merchandise to stock her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-30T00:00:21Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":58.45},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":168.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124417},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:49Z","rounded_local_amount":168.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960158},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-03-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:49Z","rounded_local_amount":168.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993002},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:17Z","rounded_local_amount":168.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717788},{"amount":58.45,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:21Z","rounded_local_amount":168.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751463},{"amount":57.75,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:32Z","rounded_local_amount":166.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933920}],"funded_date":"2009-12-30T02:23:08Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Laura Bobbit","image":null}},{"id":170040,"name":"Yacine","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Yacine Ciss\u00e9 est une femme de 35 ans, elle est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 5 enfants.

In the future, Subhadra plans to grow her farming business and livestock.  She thanks you for your support. She hopes to get a larger loan. \r\n\r\nOver 70 percent of Nepal's economy is agricultural.  Typically, Nepali households grow crops on small plots of terraced land.  Rice (bhat), lentils (daal), and vegetables (tarkari) are the staples of the Nepali diet.  With a Kiva loan, BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer.  With more seeds and fertilizer, a borrower is able to grow cash crops to be sold in the local market.  Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year. \r\n\r\nThis loan was administered by Kiva's local partner MFI, Patan Business and Professional Women. Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007.  Patan BPW operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women.  In addition to providing economic opportunity to their clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community. \r\n\r\n For more information about Patan BPW, visit our partner

She would like a loan of 4,000,000 SLL to buy more business stock. Isatu hopes that this loan will enable her to increase her monthly profits by approximately  230,000 SLL. In the future, she plans to build a house and educate her children. She thanks you for your support.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":714706,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy more plastic bowls for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Bo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.5 -11.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":148,"posted_date":"2011-03-11T20:04:24Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Isatu","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-17T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":4000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":666666.67},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":666666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.34},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":158.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":666666.67,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-20T07:59:07Z","rounded_local_amount":681213.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201881920},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":666666.67,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:18:46Z","rounded_local_amount":681213.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206104851},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":666666.67,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:40:04Z","rounded_local_amount":681213.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211175231},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":666666.67,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:39:05Z","rounded_local_amount":681213.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216458022},{"amount":158.34,"local_amount":666666.67,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-16T07:50:11Z","rounded_local_amount":681213.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221796775},{"amount":158.33,"local_amount":666666.65,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T08:34:35Z","rounded_local_amount":681213.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":226991151}],"funded_date":"2011-03-18T00:21:58Z","paid_date":"2011-09-15T08:34:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Paul & Rachel Norridge","image":828426}},{"id":285337,"name":"Patricia Alexandra","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Patricia de 32 a\u00f1os, es una mujer trabajadora  que inicio hace 6 a\u00f1os en un puesto peque\u00f1o  le gusta conversar con la gente y promocionar su producto.\n\nElla sale a su local en la bah\u00eda 6 d\u00edas a la semana.

He is a resident of San Jacinto, a town in the Department of Bol\u00edvar, where he is well-known for being a good citizen and a meat vendor.  Carlos has a butcher shop where he sells meat by the ounce, by the pound, or by the kilo according to the needs of his customers.  His experience included a traditional upbringing.  Carlos learned his trade from his father and now he has his own business, which allows him to earn enough income to support his family.  However, he wants to grow his business so that he can provide for the greater welfare of his children while they are still young and in school.  \r\n<p>\r\nCarlos sells his products for cash and also on credit.  He has the necessary equipment for his job such as knives, cleavers, tables, and a freezer with very good storage capacity of which he needs to make more effective use.  His plans going forward are to modernize his butcher shop with special machines and to secure a well-equipped location near his home.  The greatest challenge he faces is dealing with the sporadic power outages that occur whenever the town has to perform maintenance and repairs.  As a result, he has to resort to the old technique of salting the meats in order to preserve them.  He encourages his customers to prepare a delicious stew that includes three types of salted meat.  In the meantime, Carlos works toward generating a profit margin of no less than 17% from his sales.  He continually strives to improve his operating capital by securing financing.  \r\n<p>\r\nFor this reason, he has come to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo to apply for his first loan.  Using the Kiva funds, Carlos will buy meat in large amounts so that he can expand his customer base and sell more products to them.

Marubeni's business is selling food such as set menus and \u00e1 la carte dishes.  She has a small sales location which she managed to set up in her own home, in which she set up the tables and chairs she needs to serve her customers comfortably.  With her delicious dishes and the good flavor that she learned from her mother, she has gained the loyalty of her customers who she has served for five years.  What Marubeni likes about her business is having an income which she can use to support her partner with the household expenses as he works for a private company and his income often doesn't reach far enough.  For this reason, she decided to start her own business.  However, her work is very exhausting and she is tired at the end of every work day.  This does not discourage her though and she continues working with a desire to make progress.  Her plans are to grow her business, improve her premises and vary her dishes.\r\n\r\nThis will be Marubeni's fifth loan from MFP.  She feels happy and grateful for the opportunity to have a line of credit which she can use to make progress in her business.  For this reason, she pledges to make her repayments on time as she did with her previous loans.  Marubeni will use the sum of 2,000 soles that she has requested to invest in improving her business premises, painting the walls, repairing the floor and finishing off the bathrooms, so that she can provide her customers with a better atmosphere and thereby keep their loyalty."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":920507,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy paint, lay flooring and improve her bathroom infrastructure","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-11-18T22:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marubeni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":301.99},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":318.67},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":317.44},{"due_date":"2012-02-17T08:00:00Z","amount":342.39},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":355.16},{"due_date":"2012-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":364.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":113.25},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":119.04},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.39},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":133.19},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":136.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":113.25,"local_amount":301.99,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T10:43:02Z","rounded_local_amount":306.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244622040},{"amount":119.5,"local_amount":318.67,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:51:00Z","rounded_local_amount":323.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250836133},{"amount":119.04,"local_amount":317.44,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:19:59Z","rounded_local_amount":322.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257245897},{"amount":128.39,"local_amount":342.39,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:31:08Z","rounded_local_amount":347.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263385926},{"amount":133.19,"local_amount":355.16,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:42Z","rounded_local_amount":360.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270099012},{"amount":136.63,"local_amount":364.35,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:39Z","rounded_local_amount":369.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276713160}],"funded_date":"2011-11-22T15:18:59Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:30:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":363231,"name":"Teresa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Teresa is 36 years old and lives in the Philippines.

Kanyakuno B village does not have a piped water supply, so the community collects their water from Ligodho well. This water is easily contaminated with bacteria that can cause diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, meaning that Linet and her family may fall sick and become unable to work or attend school.\n\nLinet works as a business owner, but has also volunteered her time to be the promoter for a new chlorine dispenser program that enables her community to drink safe water and stay healthy. Linet and another promoter in her community, Truphena, need a loan to cover the costs of installing and maintaining chlorine dispensers at the water sources in the area. Linet will encourage the community to treat their water with the dispenser and refill the dispenser with chlorine as needed. Linet wants to be a promoter because she believes that the dispenser will reduce water-borne diseases in her community.\n\nThe Kiva loan will be repaid by Evidence Action (www.evidenceaction.org) on behalf of the community, through the sale of carbon credits. Using the chlorine dispenser generates carbon credits by avoiding the need to boil water to make it safe to drink. Revenues from the sale of carbon credits to organizations and individuals wanting to reduce their carbon footprint will be used to repay Kiva lenders and also to make sure that Linet\u2019s community can have access to safe water now and in the future.\n"}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1804423,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Health","sector":"Health","themes":["Innovative Loans","Water and Sanitation"],"use":"To support an innovative water treatment technology - chlorine dispensers","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"NDHIWA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"1 38","type":"point"}},"partner_id":324,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":900,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Linet ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Truphena ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-01-14T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":72,"loan_amount":900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2017-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2018-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2019-11-10T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2020-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2018-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2019-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2020-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":225},{"due_date":"2021-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":1794,"name":"Dora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A trained fashion designer.

This is Christina K., a 38-year-old woman from Mwanza. She is married and has four children, who are between the ages of 12 and 16 years old. <p>\r\n\r\nChristina has been running a charcoal sales business since 2007: these small, black, dirty pieces of dry earth are important to the people of Tanzania because they rely on charcoal to cook meals on a daily basis. Indeed, many Tanzanians still use small coal pots, in which they arrange mkaa (charcoal) and add either paper, dry grass, old plastic bags, or kerosene in order to light them. Because there is such a high demand for charcoal across the country, the charcoal-selling business is quite lucrative. She works at her business 12 hours per day, 7 days per week, though she notes that she is assisted by one employee. By doing so, Christina currently earns approximately $55 per month from her business operations. She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $425 in order to purchase more charcoal for resale purposes. In the future, she plans to expand her charcoal business. Christina thanks you for her support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. As such, one of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To expand her business by purchasing additional charcoal ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T18:50:41Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Christina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:38Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436336},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:23Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130608},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027405},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:04Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613406},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:17Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010486},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:58Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232785},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664601},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105332},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:24:51Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022477},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:27Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867727}],"funded_date":"2008-12-16T22:09:54Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Craig Kaufman","image":null}},{"id":83738,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosa is a member of the Las Entusiastas (\u201cThe Enthusiasts\u201d) Village Bank.

She knows for sure that her children are counting on their parents to enable their continued schooling. As a mother, she wants to give her children the best life she can.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

However, her business is still too small to earn enough for their daily financial needs. \r\n\r\nTherefore, Luz is requesting for a loan through ASHI for capital to expand her business. She is very eager for this vision because, without her business, she and her husband could have no other means to earn as much as possible.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband also manages their own PUV (public utility vehicle) route for Ozamiz and Tangub City with an average net income of not less than $23 a day. She has been engaged in her variety store business for five years already and earns approximately $68 a month from this business activity.

As an active member of PMPC under the Regular Loan Program, she has successfully repaid a loan of 35,000 PHP. She is now requesting an amount of 50,000 PHP as her 2nd loan, to be used as additional capital for her business. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her general living conditions, including meeting her basic needs, savings for future use, loan repayments, children's education, insurances and possible business expansions. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n Paglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

He is 44 years-old. Oscar is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Oscar owns and operates a service-based business. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from providing coffee, rice and meat grinding services to local community members. He is also making and selling chorizzo and longganisa or home made sausage. Oscar has been engaged in his business for over one year and earns approximately 5,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Oscar joined Kiva partner HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Oscar has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to to purchase additional ingredients and to provide working capital. Oscar is requesting a new loan of 4,000 PHP which will be used to purchase raw ingredients needed for making chorizzo and longganisa. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Oscar from HSPFI.

","en":"Maria Concepcion is 43 years old.  She is a single mother and has three daughters and one son.  She lives in the San Nicolas village and is a member and coordinator of the Senda de Amor (Path of Love) Community Bank.  Mrs. Maria started by selling nacatamales and used clothing, and for the past few years works making and selling rosquillas and quesadillas.  She gets up very early in the morning to start her day's work.  Two of her daughters help her mix the ingredients while she prepares the oven.  Once the products are done baking, one of her daughters helps her deliver them.  Through the sales of her products she is able to make a good living, but when it rains a lot she is not as successful because the firewood gets wet and the bread does not bake well and then gets overbaked.  She learned this business by watching others do it and they also helped her practice.

As a result, Philip needs a loan of US $1,100 to purchase wood, foams, leathers, nails and the material used to manufacture the furniture in order to meet the demands of his customers."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1125,"image":{"id":93083,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture Making","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase wood, foams, leathers, nails and the material used to manufacture furniture in order to meet the demands of his customers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"GH","country":"Ghana","town":"Cape Coast","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"5.1 -1.25","type":"point"}},"partner_id":91,"posted_date":"2007-12-06T10:15:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1125,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Philip","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-20T16:10:01Z","disbursal_currency":"GHS","disbursal_amount":1081.55,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":154.51},{"due_date":"2008-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":154.51},{"due_date":"2008-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":154.51},{"due_date":"2008-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":154.51},{"due_date":"2008-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":154.51},{"due_date":"2008-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":154.51},{"due_date":"2008-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":154.49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160.72},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160.72},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160.72},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160.72},{"due_date":"2008-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160.72},{"due_date":"2008-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160.72},{"due_date":"2008-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":160.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":161,"local_amount":154.78,"processed_date":"2008-02-03T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-03T09:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":155.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":127561},{"amount":161,"local_amount":154.78,"processed_date":"2008-03-03T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-03T09:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":155.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":148303},{"amount":161,"local_amount":154.78,"processed_date":"2008-04-03T10:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-03T09:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":155.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172753},{"amount":161,"local_amount":154.78,"processed_date":"2008-05-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-03T09:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":155.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":200102},{"amount":161,"local_amount":154.78,"processed_date":"2008-06-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-03T09:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":155.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227099},{"amount":161,"local_amount":154.78,"processed_date":"2008-07-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-03T09:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":155.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":256339},{"amount":159,"local_amount":152.86,"processed_date":"2008-08-03T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-03T09:31:25Z","rounded_local_amount":153.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":285088}],"funded_date":"2007-12-06T16:10:01Z","paid_date":"2008-08-03T09:14:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":30483,"name":"Rufullu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rufulla is 45 year old trader who has been selling men clothes in the central Sabirabad bazaar for nine years.

works at her husband\u2019s company, carrying out sun parasols repairs, in order to sell them at the local market.  Each week she buys the metal framework of the parasols and her husband repairs these frames, she then verifies that they are acceptable.  Once acceptable, she puts bright and gaudy color fabrics on them.  This daily activity and the sale of the parasols at local markets allows Cecilia and her family to survive.  However, the family struggles and they wish to improve their difficult economic situation.  Cecilia and her husband would like to form a business where they could sell parasols wholesale, so that their 3 children can continue to study and in the future become business professionals.  Cecilia remembers that 12 years ago, she started working with her husband in parasols.  She says they have always overcome the problems that happen to business folk like low sale, little profit, among others.  In spite of these hardships, they are very happy because they believe that have a unique position in the market as one of the most important producers of parasols, which they think will be an advantage to their future sales.  Cecilia wants to increase the production of their parasols and therefore needs increased capital, hence needing a loan.

Cada semana compra el armaz\u00f3n de metal de las sombrillas y su esposo se dedica a reparar estos armazones y ella a verificar que est\u00e9n bien, luego de haber culminado este proceso les pone telas de vistosos y llamativos colores, d\u00eda a d\u00eda esta actividad permite que Cecilia y su familia tengan el sustento diario ya que depende del trabajo de toda la semana, la venta de las mismas en las ferias locales. Los deseos de que progresen en familia y mejoren su dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica la motivan a que tenga como meta formar una empresa y poder vender al por mayor estas sombrillas, a fin de que sus 3 hijos puedan seguir estudiando y a futuro se conviertan en grandes profesionales.

This is Asha B., a 45-year-old woman from Mwanza. She is married and has two children, who are 10 and 26 years old, respectively. Additionally, she is responsible for supporting another dependant (an orphan--his parents did not care about him, so Asha took him into her family). <p>\r\n\r\nAsha has been operating a beauty salon since 2006. At her beauty salon, customers are able to buy any type of hair (long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, or blue hair) for their head, then have such hair attached to their heads, woven, cut, or braided, and finally made to look like their own hair. She works at her business 12 hours per day and 7 days per week, though she is assisted by 2 employees. By doing so, Asha is able to earn approximately $600 per month from her business operations. She is now requesting a loan in the amount of $425 in order to buy more salon products (e.g., weaving materials, short hair, long hair, and curly hair). In the future, she plans to increase her inventory of hair care products. Asha thanks you for her support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typically receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. As such, one of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239657,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty Salon","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To expand and improve her business by purchasing additional salon products (e.g., weaving materials, short hair, long hair, and curly hair)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T23:01:38Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Asha ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:48Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436342},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:22Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130614},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027411},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:05Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613412},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:09Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010492},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:57Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232789},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:57Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664605},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:09Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105336},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:24:47Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022481},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:25Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867731}],"funded_date":"2008-12-17T03:41:21Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Craig Kaufman","image":null}},{"id":83754,"name":"Maria Alejandrina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Maria Alejandrina Mart\u00ednez quiere un pr\u00e9stamo para impermeabilizar su casa el cual en temporadas de lluvias se gotea y no quiere que sus mubles se deterioren con la humedad.

He has been a farmer for the past 3 years. He began with the goal of supporting his household and above all to satisfy the needs of his children. For Hamza, agriculture is an activity that he likes to do. Vegetable growing is what he enjoys most, as it is easier to cultivate these plants, which are harvested annually and the produce is profitable. The earnings are greater when buyers purchase the production in great quantities. The expense of transportation can also be avoided when buyers come to harvest and take them away the produce themselves. Hamza is requesting a loan to invest in seeds, fertilizer, fuels and lubricants.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Takeo province. She is a farmer who owns a plot of land to cultivate rice. Aside from this plantation, she owns a pig-breeding business. Since her business is doing well, she wants to expand it.

For five years she had been involved in the manufacture of polo shirts, track suits, and jerseys in the small workshop she set up in her house.  There, she works with two people who help her fill the big orders that are given to her by educational institutions.  She recalls that, at first, she was working for another person until she was able to save and begin buying her own machines.  Currently, this productive business provides her with very good earnings.  Although the work is tiring and sometimes tedious, she is very satisfied with the results because she likes it and is able to provide help to her partner with the household expenses.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a very enterprising woman with a great desire to progress, for the future she has plans to open a stall in a local market with the clothing that she makes and, thus, hopes to sell what she manufactures with so much hard work.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the first loan that she has had with MFP, and she is certain that she will be very responsible and able to pay each installment.  Pilar is planning on investing the money that she is applying for in the purchase of material in order to begin filling one of her big orders for tracksuits and jerseys which she hopes will provide very good profits.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Richard Brown, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":484261,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Manufacturing","sector":"Manufacturing","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of fabrics for making clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-07T16:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Pilar","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":139.28},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":156.53},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":164.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":171.47},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":180.02},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":187.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.78},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.02},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":48.75,"local_amount":139.28,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:32Z","rounded_local_amount":139.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993189},{"amount":54.78,"local_amount":156.53,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":156.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717972},{"amount":57.71,"local_amount":164.88,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":165.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934116},{"amount":80.25,"local_amount":229.29,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:40:13Z","rounded_local_amount":229.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886697},{"amount":42.77,"local_amount":122.2,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:47Z","rounded_local_amount":122.32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154622},{"amount":65.74,"local_amount":187.82,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:11Z","rounded_local_amount":188.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550493}],"funded_date":"2010-02-07T18:06:34Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:33:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Rick & Pat Brown","image":null}},{"id":178550,"name":"Jenny's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jenny R. is from the town of Rizaluna Cordon.

Eliana L. is one of the members.  She chatted with us and commented that she was very grateful for the opportunity that the foundation offers to be able to continue working.\r\n\r\nEliana, 24, is a young merchant with many goals.  She started in sales when she was 18 years old with her sister, who encouraged her to work.  Because of the financial situation they were in, she had to interrupt her schooling; her father became ill and she and her sister had to take charge of the household expenses.  This made her into a responsible person and she decided to become a member of the foundation.  \r\n\r\nShe started out selling clothing but now she sells Avon and Yanbal beauty products.  Since these products are catalogue sales, she doesn\u2019t have much time available between the time her customers place orders and when she has to pay for the products.  So, she decided she needed her own capital and was able to secure it through loans from the foundation.  Now, this young merchant is able to buy an assortment of products and is able to give her customers a longer period of time to repay her.  She has an average of 35 regular customers that are very responsible; to date; she hasn\u2019t been late with her own loan payments.\r\n\r\nShe will use this new loan to buy products, like perfumes, which are the best sellers, and women\u2019s costume jewelry.  \r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a firm of products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael Bujazan, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":519795,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy Avon and Yanbal beauty products.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Portoviejo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":137,"posted_date":"2010-04-05T19:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Eliana Monserrate","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":990,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2010-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-29T07:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":123.75},{"due_date":"2010-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":123.75}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":125}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":100,"local_amount":99,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:18:44Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136674836},{"amount":275,"local_amount":272.25,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:16:56Z","rounded_local_amount":275,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144709019},{"amount":375,"local_amount":371.25,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:47:00Z","rounded_local_amount":375,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151892317},{"amount":250,"local_amount":247.5,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:20Z","rounded_local_amount":250,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159632688}],"funded_date":"2010-04-07T19:50:55Z","paid_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":195222,"name":"Elna","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Elna P. is from the village of Villalin, Pana-on, Misamis Occidental.

Cars were parked on it and so she had some income from it. A few friends gave her the best idea of her life: they were evicted from a market place and, having no place to go, they proposed to Elizabeth to rent her plot of land to them and let them have their own market. This is how the Santa Rosa Market was established. Elizabeth receives a monthly rent which enables her to pay her bills and have a comfortable life. Currently she has a new project, namely roofing part of the second floor of the market and construct rooms for rent, and so have an additional income.\r\n\r\nThe loan that was granted by Edaprospo will be used to rent premises where she will launch a new business that she has always wanted to have: her own restaurant, one of her big dreams.

She currently lives with the youngest of her three children (a daughter).  \r\n\r\nLife was very hard for Martina who faced financial hardship after she migrated to the city.  She set herself up in business with just a little capital.  She sold a range of products according to the occasion or the season.  In winter, Martina sells blankets and also bedspreads depending on what her customers request.  She also crochets items.  In parallel with this, she also sells sheep in a livestock market, as well as their meat, depending on her customer demand.  Over the years, Martina gained experience and saw the profitability of these business activities.  For this reason, she doesn't hesitate to continue working in this way, so that she can keep improving.\r\n\r\nMartina has requested several loans through MFP which have been useful to her in growing her working capital.  She has been able to buy more and more merchandise and she is very grateful for this as she believes she has a good ally who helps her in fulfilling her personal goals.
