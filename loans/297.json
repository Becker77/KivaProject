The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<P>\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She is a married woman with two children. She has a diversified activity. She is developing a commercial business selling various products as well a poultry farming business. She has ten years of experience in her activities. She is asking for a loan of 300,000 francs with which she intends to buy toys, sheets, nappies, shoes, bags, hair weaves (\"greffages\") and clothes that she will sell in her shop, which lies opposite the market in Ouakam. Her goods are often adapted to the needs of her clients depending on the occasion. What interests her most in her business is the contact with her customers and the fact that she gets to attend to them. This loan will allow her to expand the range of products she can offer to her customers with a view to satisfying their needs. The resulting increase in her profits will allow her to invest more in the poultry farming business. \r\n\r\nIn line with its ongoing vision to participate actively in the battle against poverty,

She lives i nher own house with her husband, Jose, who is 42. He works as a driver and they have two small children. For three years, this enterprising woman has worked as a merchant of turrones (traditional Peruvian sweets). This activity is only popular from September through November, which are the months that the \"Lord of the Miracles\" is remembered (a tradition linked to the Liman Christ). During the other months she makes sandwiches and french fries with sausage outside of her house in her sandwich cart that she takes out of her house every day. Although she only does the work from 6 p.m. until 11 p.m., she says that it gives her good income. Since she is an enterprising woman she plans on expanding her sandwich selling business in the future so her patrons will be more comfortable. That is why she wants to buy tables and chairs. This is the seventh loan that she has had with MFP and she promises to make her payments on time.

To overcome these problems they decided to join into one group so it's easier to communicate among members of the group and more easily get funding. \r\n\r\nNi Wayan, 30, is head of the Rejasa group and runs a pig breeding business. To grow the business, Ni Wayan invited group members to participate in loan programs for small businesses from MUK. This loan will be used to buy three piglets and pig feed.

When she got sick, her son took over the business--its popularity is due to the efforts of his mother. \r\n\r\nBecause of the difficulties that Presentaci\u00f3n has faced such as the economic crisis, he is seeking a loan for working capital and to buy corn, masa (corn flour), firewood etc. His greatest dream is to expand and improve his business so that his children can continue this way of life.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jane Agg, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":349290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"working capital","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-07-08T15:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Presentacion Jesus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.13},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T15:26:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2536.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73599974},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T17:49:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2536.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87035863},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T21:34:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2536.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96948257},{"amount":0.14,"local_amount":2.77,"processed_date":"2009-11-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:32:08Z","rounded_local_amount":2.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790187},{"amount":132.73,"local_amount":2589.91,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:33:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2627.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790188},{"amount":129.79,"local_amount":2532.5,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:33:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2569.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110680854},{"amount":127.87,"local_amount":2495.01,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:35:06Z","rounded_local_amount":2531.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075390},{"amount":121.99,"local_amount":2379.81,"processed_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:15Z","rounded_local_amount":2414.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911440},{"amount":128.09,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:12Z","rounded_local_amount":2536.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128947287}],"funded_date":"2009-07-16T17:13:35Z","paid_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:12Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":124826,"name":"Shadrach","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shadrach is 44 years old and married with eight children.

provide for the future of her two young children, ages one and five years old. She hopes that by providing them with a better education, they will be able to help her and her husband in their old age. \r\n\r\nElsie and her family live in Hacienda San Jose Baling, Libacao, Himamaylan City, Negros Occidental. Her husband buys and sells livestock in neighboring towns. Elsie became engaged in food vending to supplement her husband's income. Grilled food is popular among Filipinos, and Negros in particular is famous for its barbecue chicken. Hence, Elsie decided to offer her clients a wide variety of grilled and barbecued food served hot off the grill. Elsie bought charcoal in bulk for her food business, and now also sells that to her neighbors to make extra money. \r\n\r\nFor two years, Elsie has enjoyed tending to her food business and helping her husband support their family. Her business earns an extra PHP6,000 per month. Elsie conscientiously divides her income, setting aside a certain amount for her children's future and to budget for her family's needs. She invests the rest of her money back into her business, and is a good money manager. She paid off her last loan, taken out for PHP15,000, with no problems. \r\n\r\nNow on her seventh loan, Elsie wants to borrow PHP16,000 so that she can purchase livestock, which she intends to raise and sell in the future. The income from this venture will again be saved for her children's education and to make repairs to her house. In this photo, Elsie is posing near her food business with a display of barbecued chicken parts, hot dogs and bread on a stick.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nErlinda is married and has 7 adult-aged children. To make a living, Erlinda owns & operates a business venture in the retail sector running a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Erlinda has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 6000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Erlinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Erlinda has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Erlinda is requesting a new loan of 15000 PHP which will be used to purchase new items to expand product offering. This loan will be the sixth loan taken out by Erlinda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of the borrower's family. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\nIMON's History\r\n<p>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She lives in the urban region of the city of Cuenca.  Mar\u00eda Isabel is 40; and she has four children, 22, 21, 16, and 8.  Her first child is married and lives independently with his family.  Her second child studies at CEDEC, and he works for his personal expenses.  The other two children are in elementary and high school.  Mar\u00eda Isabel\u2019s husband emigrated to the exterior, and he sends them money to pay some of the household expenses.  They do not have their own house; they rent.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Isabel raises chickens.  She has been doing this for two years, and it is going very well.  She tells us that with her business she pays debts.  With the small earnings that she gets, she increases her business to make it more productive.\r\n\r\nThis is her third cycle working with her communal bank.  She is very grateful for all of the benefits she has.\r\n\r\nWith the loan received she will buy more chicks, food, and vitamins for her chickens, and increase her business.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda Isabel\u2019s dream is to have her own house to give her children tranquility.\r\n\r\nRosa Mar\u00eda M. P. is one of the happiest members of the Novatas Communal Bank.  She lives in the urban region of the city of Cuenca.  She is 39, married, and has six children.  They are 25, 22, 20, 18, 15, and 13.  Her first two children are married and have their own families.  The four youngest children go to school and work for their expenses.  Her husband emigrated to the exterior.  Due to the world crisis, he sends them money only when he can.  She does not have her own house; she rents.\r\n\r\nRosa raises chickens.  She has had the business for three years, and it is going very well because she has orders from fixed customers.  When she has time, she works in her son\u2019s upholstery shop.\r\n\r\nThis is her third cycle with the Fundaci\u00f3n Espor.  She is very proud of the improvement she has made thanks to the loans she received.  With the loan from the Foundation she will buy food for the chickens because she wants to expand the business.\r\n\r\nHer dream is to have a business selling wood and to expand her chicken business to give her children a better future.\r\n\r\nLourdes de la Nube Zhispun P. is a member of the Novatas Communal Bank.  She lives in the Medio Ejido area, an urban region of the city of Cuenca.  She is happily married, 29, and she has four children.  She is three months pregnant with her fifth child.  She tells us that this pregnancy is giving her some complications, and she has to spend more time resting.  She lives in a rented house.  Her husband works in an upholstery shop.  They are a stable family.\r\n\r\nLourdes works in her own beauty station.  She knows a lot about cuts and styles that are in fashion because she has worked in this area of beauty for 14 years.  She has 12 years of experience.  She has her own customers.  She has worked in her own business for seven months because she bought the place.\r\n\r\nThis is her third loan with the Foundation.  She is very happy because the money the Foundation loans her pays for the installments on her place.  She also gets more beauty products to put in her showcase.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to expand her beauty location and open other branches.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny

They are his inpiration to gain a better life.  For the past 20 years, Adolfo has operated a mechanic's shop for motorcycles and moto-cars.  His shop is located on a portion of his land because there isn't a better place available for him to work quietly.  In addition to his workshop, Adolfo had the opportunity to purchase a moto-taxi for himself, and during his free time he either transports passengers with it or rents it to other taxi drivers who are without access to a moto-taxi.  When he rents his moto-taxi, his earnings also increase at the mechanic's shop because he has more time to simply interact with his clients and thus create permanent clients who return to him time after time.  Currently, he is hoping to find a different plot of land where he can build his workshop, in order to have it in a more convenient location.  This is Adolfo's fourth loan with Micro-Finanzas Prisma, and he is very reliable when it comes to his loan repayments.  He plans to invest the loan in his mechanic's workshop by purchasing new tools so that he can take better care of his clients' needs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Suzy Marinkovich, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":460981,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Auto Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of tools and renovation of mechanic's workshop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"PUCALLPA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.379147 -74.553866","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-12-30T16:20:17Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adolfo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-12-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-08T08:00:00Z","amount":228.4},{"due_date":"2010-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":232.05},{"due_date":"2010-03-09T08:00:00Z","amount":247.59},{"due_date":"2010-04-09T07:00:00Z","amount":253.61},{"due_date":"2010-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":264.1},{"due_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":274.25}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.94},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.22},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.65},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":88.77},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.43},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.99}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.94,"local_amount":228.4,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:46Z","rounded_local_amount":230.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124420},{"amount":81.22,"local_amount":232.05,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:28Z","rounded_local_amount":233.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123960161},{"amount":86.65,"local_amount":247.59,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:22Z","rounded_local_amount":249.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993005},{"amount":88.77,"local_amount":253.61,"processed_date":"2010-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:38:20Z","rounded_local_amount":255.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717791},{"amount":92.43,"local_amount":264.1,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:11Z","rounded_local_amount":266.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751466},{"amount":95.99,"local_amount":274.25,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:23Z","rounded_local_amount":276.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933923}],"funded_date":"2009-12-30T17:48:08Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:23Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Suzy Marinkovich","image":313359}},{"id":170200,"name":"Norie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Norie E. is from the village of Omunay, Damulog, Bukidnon.

The group is called \u201cMujeres Maravilla\u201d (\u201cWonder Women\u201d) and is made up of 19 very active women from the same area who show great solidarity with one another.  They have different business activities, and some group members were able to start new businesses in order to generate income and thus support their families.  For example, Mrs. Ignacia V. did not have a business, but after joining this committee she became enthusiastic and started working as a street vendor selling clothing. She travels around, visiting commercial establishments in remote areas of the city. She earns good money and feels very fulfilled. She is happy to be able to help her family improve their quality of life.

It is a small rural community with around 2,000 inhabitants, mostly producing milk and coffee beans. The area has hilly terrain and a lot of it is tropical rain forest. There are some real beauty spots, where the tropical forest meets two lovely lakes, coffee plantations and dairy farms. \r\n\r\nIn a little over two years, Alexander has developed himself into a micro-entrepreneur, with a small business producing milk and milk products such as cheese and cream. His children have helped him keep the home and business running, even helping to make and market the produce. He says he is very happy with this project: it has increased his confidence and provided income to improve their living conditions despite difficulties that have befallen the little community - indeed it has enabled him to keep his family together, as it means he has not had to leave to find work in the city. Now Alexander needs a loan of 623,000 colones ($1200) in order to buy a milk cow from his neighbour. With this cow he will be able to increase his production, generate more income, and continue to develop as an entrepreneur.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Rosa Oswald, Kiva

D., a married woman living in Prk. Indol, Brgy. Nangka, Bayawan City, Negros Oriental, earns her living by operating two enterprises:  a general Store and a chopsachem dealership. Her husband, Nestor D., 49, works as a rice operator to earn a living.  They have four children ranging in age from 14 to 23. Flora joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired to something better for her family. <p>\r\n\r\nWith the help of her past 19 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Flora has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 19,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 4,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time she is borrowing PHP 19,500 to buy more stocks and new products for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future of her children and for home repairs. Flora D. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.<p>\r\n\r\nHelp NWTF continue its mission to help the poorest in the Philippines by clicking the link to the NWTF Kiva lending team  on Kiva.org to join our

She lives in her own home with her youngest son Juan who is 23 years old.  She has eight children in all but her older children are all married and have their own families.\r\n\r\nThis hard-working lady has been selling things her whole life.  For the past 10 years she has been selling meals to salespeople in a market in a neighboring area.  From Monday to Friday she cooks her meals very early in the morning and then delivers them to her customers.  Her customers pay her weekly and she is very satisfied because she makes regular income which means that she can support herself and help her son with the household expenses.\r\n\r\nIn parallel with this business, Alejandrina also sells clothes to order on weekends and makes regular income from this activity too.  As she is a very enterprising woman, in the future she plans to set up a store selling spare parts for cars since her older children have this type of business and she knows that the profits are good.\r\n\r\nThis is Alejandrina's seventh loan from MFP and she pledges to make her repayments punctually.  She doesn't want to let down the people who made this support possible as it will enable her to continue working in search of progress.

has to learn and re-learn certain values in life in order to develop the right attitude and become successful. At the age of 50, Paciencia Pisuana is committed to re-learning many things in her life. She only attained a high school education, but she makes sure she understands and applies every lesson she receives from CCT* as a community partner. Paciencia and her husband Ferdinand, who is employed as a chauffeur, live in Dasmarinas, Cavite, where they have raised four children. One of their children stays at home, one is employed, one is in enrolled in high school, and the youngest  is in elementary school.\r\n \r\nPaciencia is a determined entrepreneur. She patiently manages her own little sari-sari (variety) store daily, which is situated near their home. Here she sells instant noodles, sachets of shampoo, and detergent, as well as soft drinks, which serve as a popular thirst quencher in the hot weather. She also runs a carinderia (small eatery), where she cooks meals for busy working people. In addition, she sells mineral water as an additional source of income. Together, these micro-entrepreneurial efforts enable her to earn Php 10,000 per month.\r\n\r\nTo help her improve her primary business, she is applying for a Php 9,000 loan. She will use this to replenish the stock of products she offers in her store. She knows she has to do this in order to offer her regular customers fresher options and encourage them to patronize her store. With additional money on hand and with a commitment to continuous learning, Paciencia is positive that she will become more profitable with her business.\r\n\r\nAs with any other entrepreneur, it is Pacienca's dream to make her sari-sari store grow. She aims to earn more in order to be able to save more and to level up her business. But her deepest dreams are as simple as they can be: amidst all the hassle of running a sari-sari store, a carinderia, and a mineral water business, she desires a peaceful, healthy life - not just for herself but for her entire family.\r\n\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":730012,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to replenish and expand the stock of goods she offers in her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Dasmarinas, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-03-12T22:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paciencia ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-04-25T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-05-09T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-05-30T07:00:00Z","amount":600},{"due_date":"2011-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:37:55Z","rounded_local_amount":3265.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201256856},{"amount":60,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:33:58Z","rounded_local_amount":2612.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206123549},{"amount":75,"local_amount":3000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T10:49:41Z","rounded_local_amount":3265.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211194878},{"amount":15,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:00Z","rounded_local_amount":653.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216474007}],"funded_date":"2011-03-13T07:09:19Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T10:43:00Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Maeve","image":1271729}},{"id":285497,"name":"Nicolas","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nicolas works hard to support his family.

She joined One Acre Fund in order to access fertilizer and hybrid seeds and ensure food security for her family. In the recent 2011 season, Alice had a very good maize yield harvesting 11 bags on 1\/2 acre of land. Before joining One Acre Fund, Alice was only able to harvest five bags of maize on 1\/2 acre of land. With this loan, One Acre Fund will purchase fertilizer, seeds, and other important inputs to distribute to Alice and her group during Kenya\u2019s next planting season in February 2012. The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance. \r\n\r\nWith income from maize sales, Alice will educate her children and invest in livestock rearing. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Mukhungula W.G group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.

Sometimes she prepares food to sell at the Saturday market in Mazocruz.\r\n\r\nWith this loan of 800 Soles, which she will repay in four months, she will buy five heads of alpaca that she will sell as meat to wholesalers.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to buy a home in the city of Ilave and support her son until he becomes a professional. She also plans to deliver grocery products to the various markets to generate more earnings.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jay Osborne, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":208885,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"five head of alpaca","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mazocruz, Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.75 -69.733333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2008-10-14T16:40:26Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yudith Roxana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-10-28T21:57:08Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":68.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-11-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-16T07:57:32Z","rounded_local_amount":204.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5331015},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2008-12-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T00:55:38Z","rounded_local_amount":204.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9951385},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-01-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T13:49:03Z","rounded_local_amount":204.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10224412},{"amount":68.75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-18T08:07:03Z","rounded_local_amount":204.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20417135}],"funded_date":"2008-10-14T21:57:08Z","paid_date":"2009-03-18T08:07:03Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jay Osborne","image":883556}},{"id":71610,"name":"Safinia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Safinia, 30 years old and divorced with two children, has been preparing and selling food in Zanzibar for seven years.

They have their own place but they rent a house that they use as a workshop for the business.  For 10 years, Esperanza has operated an auto body repair and paint shop.  They decided to start the business because her husband is skilled at repairing and painting auto bodies.  The business has grown little by little and their services are now in such demand that they have two employees to help them.  They charge up to 750 soles per vehicle, depending on what damage was done, some of which they spend on buying the materials they need to return the vehicle to good condition.  Esperanza very much enjoys the work and being a woman has never been an impediment to doing it.  She tells us that she prefers the hard work of the shop to the drudgery of her kitchen at home.  Her husband, as well as she herself, hope to continue working hard to get ahead and improve the business.

She sells sweets, and her kiosk is located on the campus of the EMI (Military School of Engineering), which is in the Alto Irpavi area.  Her family is comprised of her husband, a doorman for that institution, and their three minor children.  Two of the children are school-age and dependent upon them.  They live in a small house that the institution provides.  She has her own small house in the El Alto region.  Her two grown and independent children live there.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she gets from the institutions will do a lot.

Moses has subsisted on a produce sales business for four years. At the young age of 24 years, he is a fledgling business trendsetter whose example is bound to stand out as a benchmark for other youth in his home area of Kisiita in Mubende district. Many youth in his home area preoccupy themselves in self-destructive activity like drinking. With his hard work, he has managed to take firm root and in a week he apparently makes 50,000 shillings.\r\n\r\nWith his monthly savings, Moses has managed to diversify his small business. This has, however, not come the easy way as he has had to grapple with many adversities such as the unpredictable weather patterns which, for the most part, mean he has fewer supplies from farmers.\r\n\r\nMoses\u2019 dream is to build his own produce stalls to store and keep his surplus goods.

This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future, and target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans, and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n

He has broadened his business experience since his university studies, where in his free time he earned his living making canvas bags, taking advantage of the local market provided by his fellow students.  Afterward, he got some more experience by getting together with a friend and starting up a microbusiness selling vacuum-packed frozen goods like cheese sticks, little empanadas, and other snacks.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago his knack for innovation led him to rent an apartment garage and buy baking equipment. He has been well-received by his clients, so he has gradually been adding new products requested by his customers, like rice, oil, sugar, and grains, such that 50% of his sales are supplies and the other 50% are baked goods.  At the same time, William is using his commercial space to offer phone calling and recharge services that bring him additional income.  William works in his baking business Monday through Saturday and takes in average daily sales of 350,000 COP with an average profit margin of 35%.  \r\n\r\nThe loan William is requesting from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo DOmingo is primarily to buy merchandise and baking ingredients so he can increase his store's inventory.  He'll also buy supplies and ingredients in greater quantity so he can get discounts.  His goal is to expand his business, taking advantage of the market niche he's positioned in, which is making and selling snack foods and natural juices, a business he'd put on the terrace of his store, which is pretty big.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1150,"image":{"id":702075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy inventory, and baking ingredients.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-01-31T18:30:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1150,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Willian Enrique","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-28T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2100000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":1150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2011-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2011-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2011-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2011-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2011-08-04T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2011-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2011-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":175000},{"due_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":175000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":95.84},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:12Z","rounded_local_amount":178441.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289242},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":178441.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157381},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:25Z","rounded_local_amount":178441.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230391},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:03Z","rounded_local_amount":178441.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509253},{"amount":95.84,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:50:28Z","rounded_local_amount":178441.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673475},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:00:55Z","rounded_local_amount":178441.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320031},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:44Z","rounded_local_amount":178441.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803175},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-20T08:51:31Z","rounded_local_amount":178441.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568245},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":175000,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":178441.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250779592},{"amount":287.51,"local_amount":525000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:30:58Z","rounded_local_amount":535324.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270039317}],"funded_date":"2011-01-31T23:28:24Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T09:30:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jill Heske","image":253856}},{"id":273218,"name":"Edy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Edy, de 32 a\u00f1os, natural del distrito de Quimbiri;

Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Carlina R. is from the village of Benito Soliven, San Mariano, Isabela. She is 50 years old. Carlina is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nCarlina is single. She owns & operates a business selling fish balls and other dimsums to the local community. Carlina has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 4,000 PHP a month.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Carlina joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and her ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 4,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase raw ingredients needed to make products for sale. She is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her 4th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fishermen and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1375,"image":{"id":727680,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food

She lost her father before she was born, so her mother and her older siblings were responsible for her upbringing. She went to school until the seventh grade and got pregnant when she was seventeen years old - that lead her to move in with the baby's father, with whom she later had three more children. Twenty years later, her husband, after retiring from the company he worked for, left Gilda and took on a relationship with his fex-wife in the city of Inhambane.\r\nIn order to provide for her children she tried to find a job but had no success.She, then, came up with the idea to start up a business to sell clothes and assorted products. With the help of a friend she began traveling to South Africa - it still is the place where she buys her merchandise from. She has been able to support five people with the income generated from her business.\r\nShe became aware of Hluvuku through her son-in-law, who works at Catembe. She was approved for a 12.000,00 mt loan which she spent buying additional merchandise to strenghten her business that was dwindling financially at that point.\r\nIn the future, she intends to settle in a shop where she can accommodate and sell all of her products. Currently, she has no fixed location to sell her merchandise. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from Portuguese by Bertolt Cantalice, Kiva Volunteer\r\nCliente: Gilda Sebasti\u00e3o C.\r\nActividade: Com\u00e9rcio\r\nValor de Empr\u00e9stimo: 12.000,00mt (480.00US$)\r\nAplica\u00e7\u00e3o do Empr\u00e9stimo: Compra e venda de produtos\r\nIn\u00edcio: 10\/07\/07\r\nFim:    31\/07\/2008\r\n\r\nGilda Sebasti\u00e3o C. nascido em 10 de Dezembro de 1965 em Chibuto na prov\u00edncia de Gaza.

Soedjodo K. is a master carpenter in Gbadago, Togo. Born on Nov. 28, 1980 in Vogan, Togo, he is married and father of one child. After his primary schooling, he was not able to remain in school because of his parents' poverty, and this pushed him to pursue an apprenticeship. He has now been working in his trade for five years. An upstanding and creative man and good at managing his business, he would like to produce furniture of excellent quality for sale. For that reason, he is requesting a loan of US$ 1000 so that he can purchase wood, machines for his workshop (lathe, plane, table saw, etc.)  which will allow him to increase his income and better support his family since his wife does not work outside the home and thus has no income to add to his. <P><B>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer<p><\/B>Mr K.

This is 30-year-old Norah M. from Dar es Salaam. She is married with two children between the ages of 2 and 4 years old. Norah has been running a beauty salon business since 2006. This is the place where you can buy long hair, short hair, curly hair, straight hair, red hair, blue hair, and then have it attached to your head, woven, cut, or braided, and made to look like your own. She works at the business for 9-12 hours per day, 6 days per week. Norah currently earns about 200 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 600 USD in order to purchase hair products and a dryer. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Norah thanks you for her support.\r\n\r\nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":255861,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

She is married and has 3 daughters between the ages of 6 and 16 who are all studying in the official schools of Boane.  Leonora attended school until the 4th grade but left school due to various difficulties.  She lives with her husband, children and her mother, whom she supports. \r\n\r\nLeonora left Maputo for Swaziland (a neighboring country of Mozambique) in 2003.  There, she began a business selling clothing.  She returned to Mozambique with her husband and continued her business. She has an employee who helps her with the business.  Leonora sells a variety of clothing, shoes, and blankets, with monthly earnings of 6.000,00 MT that she uses to support her family and even save a bit for emergencies.\r\n\r\nShe has never had a loan with other banks.  When she returned from Swaziland, she learned about Hluvuku-Adsema through neighbors and came to the bank for her first loan of 20.000,00 MT which she used to increase her inventory.  With the current loan also 20.000,00 MT, she plans to purchase more merchandise (blankets, clothing, and shoes) to sell in the local market in Boane.\r\n\r\nShe plans to pay off the loan without any problems in order to be able to request future loans with the goal of expanding her business and improving her family's social condition.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from operating an e-loader \"SMART\" business. Claire has been engaged in her business for over 1 year and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Claire joined GDMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.

He is 57 years old, is a widower, and the father of one child who is 26 years old and a 7 year-old granddaughter who goes to school. He completed through 6th grade himself but stopped due to lack of funds. He lives in his own home with is family and he doesn't support anyone else besides his granddaughter. \n\nHe left Maxixe for Maputo when he was transferred. He has worked as a nurse for the Ministry of Health for more than 30 years. He does not have any employees and he makes a monthly salary of 3,000MT, which he uses to pay for his household expenses and occasionally saves some to his bank account. \n\nHe has never taken out a loan with another bank. He came to know Hluvuku through friends who were also clients of the institution. This is his 2nd loan for the amount of 12,000MT, with which he plans to purchase construction materials (plates, beams, cement, stone, etc.) to finish construction on his home. The previous loan was for 10,000MT and was used for the same purpose.\n\nHe promises to make his repayments dutifully so that he can access future loans. In the future, he'd like to take out more loans to furnish his home and purchase a motor vehicle to facilitate his trips from home to work. \n\n\n\n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by

Widowed and left alone to support her college enrolled oldest child and her youngest who is in high school. Norma works hard. By the grace of God, she has managed to support her child's schooling up to college level. At this time, she is working hard to be able to send her youngest all the way through college.\r\n\r\nNorma operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store, which retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a Php5-worth of cooking oil, or an egg. She earns by getting supplies at wholesale prices and selling at retail rates.  Her store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of Php300 in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries, and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nNorma dreams of being able to renovate her house soon, with all of her work with the business.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

They have three children ages 15, 11, and 10. She has been selling household utensils and tools for three years, during which she has increased her stock and products.  She aspires to run the business in a permanent building and offer larger quantities. \r\n\r\nShe had a challenge getting credit because the informal village savings group she belonged to did not give loans and members could only access their savings refunds upon exit or from small emergency-only loans. It was only after a friend who was a co-member in the savings group informed her about KADET that she was able to access a loan. This will be her second loan and she intends to use the money to increase her stock. She has also engaged a local tinsmith for regular supplies of cheap locally-made household tools.\r\n\r\nAbout KADET:\r\nThe Kenya Agency for the Development of Enterprise and Technology (KADET) is
