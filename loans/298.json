As an aspiring and hard-working man he has always dreamed of achieving success in whatever he does. Thus, when he joined IMON International four years ago, he was able to make much progress with his previous loan, which he invested mostly in crop farming.\r\n\r\nThen, Jamoliddin saw a new business opportunity: rearing calves, which is very profitable because of the constant demand for meat at the market. Given this loan, he will purchase calves and feed for them to expand his business.\r\n\r\nJamoliddin plans to use the profits from his business to educate his children, improve the structure of his home, and improve the standard of living of his family.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Lamulatu is 21 years-old and lives in the town of Kyotera in the Masaka area of Uganda.  She is married and has two children.  Lamulatu has a business managing a retail store, which sells various small goods, in Kyotera.  Lamulatu has had her retail business for approximately one-and-a-half years.\r\n\r\nTo expand her business, Lamulatu is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan Shillings from Kiva partner BRAC Uganda.  The loan will be used to buy goods to resell and obtain more inventory for her retail shop.  Lamulatu hopes to expand her business and gain more clients in order to generate profits for her family.  \r\n\r\nNote to lenders: BRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product to Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program.  This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. First, the ELA program provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills.  Afterwards, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses.  These loans offer youth a unique chance to access finance at a young age, improve their prospects for the future and to target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance.  Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans and give Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":559842,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

The area is in the La Libertad region, an hour from the city of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nShe is in business selling groceries and household necessities, from a store in her home. She provides her customers with all sorts of everyday products, which they used to have to go all the way to the district market to buy. Nieves likes to make sure her customers always find the quality goods they want in her shop. Together with her friendly manner, this has meant she now has a group of loyal customers who choose to make their purchases in her shop. Her husband works driving a mototaxi (which is a motorcyle with a cab on the back that is used for transporting goods or passengers). With the two incomes they share in the running of their home.\r\n\r\nNieves wants to grow her business by purchasing additional stock to offer her customers, so she has requested a loan of 2000 soles from [field partner] Edpyme Alternativa that will help her realize her aims.

She sells and makes food as a source of income and has had the business for over 10 years.  Her business is located in the market.  In the beginning, she had very little capital but had the will to get ahead since she had to pay the household expenses and give her children a good education and food.  Little by little she increased her inventory with very little earnings but her customers kept coming back since Rosa\u2019s attention to her customers is very good and she always greets them with a smile on her lips.

The following year, she was able to build an iron-roofed house for her family to expand from the thatch-roofed stone hut they had lived in for years. Since then, Larisa's business has grown even more, with a second plot of land and house for rent. Larisa is a self-sufficient farmer and businesswoman.

He has been pursuing this activity for 6 years, during which time he moved to live in the forest; he is a native the Peruvian mountains. When he came to the forest, he was so pleased with the lifestyle and his work that he decided to settle there with his family. He says that the weather is perfect, and the land is very productive. Because Ra\u00fal is a very enterprising man, he has already planned to buy his own farm in the future, where he will grow coffee, corn, bananas and yucca.

Since her children are young, she has to work to give them a better quality of life. She remembers buying clothing for herself and her children in a market in their area shortly after starting work at Gamarra [the largest commercial center in Lima] making clothing. It was then that she noticed that what she paid for the clothing she bought was twice their original price. She also discovered that the clothing makers got the clothing for less. For this reason she decided to open a business selling clothing. She started buying from the merchants whom she knew, and they encouraged her to do it because of her charisma. As in all businesses, at the beginning it was difficult because she did not have capital. Knowing the business was very helpful because she invested the money from her first loan to purchase some garments such as polos, pants and blouses. Her business has given her much satisfaction, as for example she can have various comforts in her home, buying fixtures that she did not have. With this recent loan she will be able to purchase more clothing to sell, taking advantage of the dates where there are many sales. In the future she wants to have another business that has to do with the area of food or groceries. She is working and saving up for this.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her previous loan of PHP 17,000 (which she paid off well within its term) was just another step on her journey toward economic freedom. Ma.

For her it is not difficult to repay her loan because she has work every day. She makes her sales as a street vendor, and sometimes her route is a little difficult. She doesn\u2019t have a fixed place of her own where she can offer her products, and that is why she has to move from one place to another.\r\n\r\nAmong the challenges that Carmen faces is her vision, however her problem doesn\u2019t keep her from working and making progress in her projects.\r\n\r\nCarmen\u2019s  biggest project is to establish her clothing business permanently in an adequate space where she won\u2019t have to walk or carry around her merchandise.

His business began 20 years ago when his mother-in-law proposed that they unite her good sense for cooking with his capital, since he was working for a major company in Barranquilla at the time.  So he started his business sharing profits with his mother-in-law, selling hayacas, cakes, chichas, treats, and products derived from wheat flour like cheese sticks and empanadas.  His mother-in-law passed away last year and he has continued working with the paternal family.  \r\n\r\nToday Eric has many customers from different unions.  He works only on weekends and holidays.  For the production he has all the necessary utensils to grow the business.  Eric lives with his mother and sisters and has 2 children in his care.  He also has the legacy of good cooking sense that his mother-in-law left him to continue generating income for the well being of his children.  He also generates additional income by serving as collector of a cooperative.  \r\n\r\nNow he wants to continue to strengthen his working capital and this is the reason he requests the loan.

She is married to Raniel, a laborer, and is the mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nYolanda runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Yolanda\u2019s case, she is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special kinds are displayed on hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are much cheaper compared with brand new clothes sold in malls. Since Yolanda\u2019s stall is located in an urban poor public market, her business flourishes. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) net sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand the business, Yolanda is requesting a PHP10,000 loan to buy additional used-but-quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, and also used bags and footwear. If she can roll the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\r\n\r\nYolanda hopes to to give her children a good future and a high quality education through all her hard work on her business. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week, and this is where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":988096,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

He inherited his farm from his parents, who planted peas and vegetables according to the season. The crop depends on the seasons, and his parents taught Robert how to plant accordingly. With these concepts in mind Robert began to plant, but his crop didn't do well. He tried planting flowers, but this also failed. Nevertheless, four years ago a friend proposed that Robert plant chamomile in his fields, and this crop has been profitable, because there is no competition. Robert harvests the chamomile every three months, in April, July, and November. This means that he must invest a lot of money in labor, in order to transplant,harvest, fertilize, and fumigate. Each of these jobs costs between 200 and 300 soles. Robert invested 1500 soles in this last harvest, hoping to earn five times as much. In order to realize his dreams he has to go to a lot of trouble to fertilize and cultivate large quantities of chamomile.

They plant rice and vegetables. To assist her husband in their farming needs, she is now borrowing a loan of PHP 20,000 for their farm maintenance. The amount will be of big help to purchase their needed agricultural inputs such as fertilizers, hybrid seeds and pesticides.

He describes himself as a mature and aggressive businessman that is trustworthy and innovative.  He owns two retail clothing stores, from which he sells men's jeans and shirts.  On a daily basis, he runs one of these stores, while his wife runs the other shop across town.  From this business, Francis generates approximately 30,000 KES per month. <p>\r\n\r\nFrancis explains that he started his business two years ago with a loan from Equity Bank.  He was able to obtain this loan because he was a salaried employee working in accounting.  When he left his accounting job, he opted for a loan from KADET to help him improve his business.  With this loan that he is seeking, Francis will purchase new jeans and shirts to sell in his clothing shops.  He only buys one of each style so that he can keep his merchandise unique, which he thinks draws customers to his stores.  In the future, Francis hopes to open a large retail shop and to import specialty men's clothing. <p>\r\n\r\nAbout KADET: \r\nThe Kenya Agency for the Development of Enterprise and Technology (KADET) is dedicated to economically empowering its clients.

She is in charge of running the warehouse for her father's mechanic shop. She has two children. Her oldest son Ramiro is 19 and lives with his grandmother because she lives alone. Her daughter Belen is only four years old and is in pre-school. Thanks to a housing project in the Forests of Juigalpan residential development Carolina was able to purchase her own home with a long-term mortgage. The house has an unimproved floor and because her daughter is little and likes playing on the floor she would like a second loan to improve the house using ceramic tiles and thus avoid potential illnesses for her daughter.

All of the members of the Centro Agricola de Santa Lucia Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia. They will use the microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other's guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Centro Agricola Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p> \r\n<p><em>Below is more information about Santa Lucia compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The sector is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p> \r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not count on formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and pay fair prices for their crops.  <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p> \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":34517,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To farm rice on her lands","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-07T20:28:46Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Grey","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-22T05:17:56Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-21T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-21T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-21T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":200,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2007-06-08T09:16:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T07:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":200,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21451},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-09T23:11:14Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T07:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40770},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-22T18:04:04Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T07:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":45289},{"amount":812,"local_amount":812,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T18:03:58Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T07:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":812,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99043},{"amount":100,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-01-02T21:42:54Z","settlement_date":"2008-01-03T07:15:38Z","rounded_local_amount":100,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":106803}],"funded_date":"2007-05-08T05:17:56Z","paid_date":"2008-01-02T21:42:54Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":13934,"name":"Identity","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"The entrepreneur is 26 years old.

","en":"Buenaventura Ojetaciano C. is 43 years old and single.  His goal is to keep his business going because he totally depends on it as his only source of income and a means to help his brother, nieces and nephews, his only family.  He most wants to set the business up in a better place because he would like to have his own shop, preferably in his house, a grocery where he can sell his merchandise.  He dreams of remodeling his humble house and teaching his nieces and nephews the importance of hard work in reaching your goals.  Buenaventura has borrowed from Fundacion Leon 2000 before and his performance has been very good.  He's made a success of the business because he's persistent and because he knows that he can get what he wants if he works hard.\r\n<p>\r\nBuenaventura makes a living selling snacks and cold drinks.  His business is located on the northern edge of UNAN, just outside the university.  He's operated the business for 20 years.  He started it on his own, having learned to work hard from the time he was a boy, with only a few products kept in a basket, selling cigarettes and candy to passers-by.  He worked as a street vendor around Leon where he met a lot of students who were customers for the cigarettes he sold.  The work was exhausting because his house was far away, so he decided to find a spot to set up permanently.  He had to find a place with a lot of passers-by so he decided on the street near UNAN.  Buenaventura has borrowed from Fundacion twice and has a good payment record.  He's now applying for a loan which he will use for working capital.  He'll increase the range of products he sells to meet customer demand and buy from different distributors in Leon so that he can get a favorable return for Fundacion Leon 2000 and the organizations that are interested in helping small businessmen.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":267348,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Working capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-02-07T03:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Buenaventura Ojetaciano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":6000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":1000},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.95,"local_amount":1158.94,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:38:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1158.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27092059},{"amount":42.05,"local_amount":841.06,"processed_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:36:46Z","rounded_local_amount":841.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35985441},{"amount":50,"local_amount":1000,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T23:08:23Z","rounded_local_amount":1000,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44446057},{"amount":50.73,"local_amount":1014.56,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:42:11Z","rounded_local_amount":1014.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52956694},{"amount":99.27,"local_amount":1985.44,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:32Z","rounded_local_amount":1985.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63174117}],"funded_date":"2009-02-07T20:11:30Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T14:00:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":91782,"name":"Rk","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"RK A. is a 70-year-old married man with six children.

She wants to make her business grow and because of this, she would like to borrow PHP 5,000.00 so that she can buy more stocks of groceries for her store and hopefully be able to sell meat and fish. She is also engaged in selling eggs and ducks in their public market for additional income. She hopes that her business will continue to grow so that her two children will finish their studies.\r\n <p>\r\nAccording to Marivic, she is now content with her life.

She lives with her husband and her four children whose ages range between 12 and 27.  The three youngest go to school.  She isn't responsible financially for anyone else and saves 1,500 meticais a month.<p>\r\nLina left Gaza for the town of Namaacha on the border with Swaziland with her oldest brother, who was working for the registry office in that district.  When she arrived to Namaacha, she enrolled in school.  In that same year, she became pregnant and had to stop studying because at that time it wasn't allowed to go to school while pregnant.  She got married, and five days later, her husband abandoned her and left for South Africa.  He left a letter that she only discovered 6 months later claiming that he was going to look for a job.  Her life was difficult, so she asked her brother for help, and he got her a job at the registry office where she worked for 5 years.  After she finished her contract, she married her current husband who now lives with her in her home.  With the money she made from her job, she started her own business selling capulanas (robes\/dresses) which she acquired in Maputo and resold in Swaziland.  Her business has grown and she can't satisfy her customers' demand anymore.  She is turning to Hluvuku and Kiva for her fourth loan so she can increase her stock of merchandise.  Today she has better products (sheets, blankets, duvets, pants, and curtains).  She buys these items for 400, 500, and 350 meticais and resells them for 1,000, 1250, and 600 meticais.  She makes a monthly profit of 8,000 meticais.<p>\r\nThis is her fourth loan with Hluvuku and her second with Kiva.  Her first one was for 11,000 meticais to buy various types of clothing like blouses, sheets, duvets, blankets, pants, and curtains).  Her second one was for 15,500 meticais to increase her volume of merchandise.  Her third was for 20,000 meticais to expand her kitchen, which is now complete.  This one is for 25,000 meticais, which she will use to increase the volume of her business.  She is building a boutique because at her age she doesn't want to make deliveries to people's homes anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Tanya Harper, Kiva

The reason why she was consistent in paying her dues was because she used almost all the money she borrowed as added capital for her food business.  Her business lets her earn a profit of PHP 18,000 per month.  \r\n\r\nNow, with your help, she would like to apply for a PHP 12,000 loan. This amount will be mostly used as a source of added capital for expanding her business by buying different food ingredients and seasoning for the food that she sells in her food stand.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that one day her mini food stand will become a restaurant for their family business. \r\n\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

The main source of income for the business comes primarily from harvesting and selling wild-caught fish in the local community. Lilybeth has been engaged in her business for over six years and earns approximately 2,500 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Lilybeth joined PMPC, a Kiva partner, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Lilybeth has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,500 PHP from PMPC. This previous loan was used to purchase construction materials for a house repair. Lilybeth is requesting a new loan of 14,500 PHP, which will be used to purchase fishing equipment, including hooks and nets. This fishing activity is managed by her husband. This will be the ninth loan taken out by Lilybeth from PMPC and this is her third time published on Kiva. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva

","en":"This group is called \u201cTIACAQUE\u201d because that\u2019s the name of the community and the name means \u201cplace where the water rises between cliffs\u201d because the community is located on top of a small hill and between some dams.  \r\n\r\nIt is located in the community of Tiacaque, M\u00e9xico, which has a tourist center of the same name noted for its trout hatcheries.  Adjacent are the communities of San Francisco Cheje and Ejido de Malacota.  It\u2019s a place where residents, for the most part, raise livestock: sheep, calves, doves and wild animals in general.\r\n\r\nThe group has 12 members.  One of them is Mar\u00eda Cristina O. M., 28.  She finished secondary school and she comments that she wants to use her business to help her husband so that their children can become professionals as well as learn to run a business so that some day they can have their own.\r\n\r\nShe is married and has two children, a boy and a girl.  She raises sheep that she sells in the Ixtlahuaca market on Mondays and also to neighbors and relatives primarily.\r\n\r\nShe started four years ago not thinking it would become a source of income.  She enjoys the business because profits she earns from it provide a few comforts for her children but especially guarantees that they have enough to eat.\r\n\r\nHer dedication and perseverance will make good sales possible because she has faced difficulties, like animal disease and death, in the past.  However, with help from the loan she will rise above these problems and keep her business safe.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3225,"image":{"id":621590,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To restart her cattle raising business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"Atlacomulco, Estado de M\u00e9xico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":158,"posted_date":"2010-10-21T19:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3225,"lender_count":86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adriana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Griselda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria De Lourdes","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Maria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magdalena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ma Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Antonia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Irais","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":40000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":3225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2053},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":2106},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2160},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":2215},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":2272},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":2331},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":2390},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":2452},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":2515},{"due_date":"2010-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":2579},{"due_date":"2010-12-28T08:00:00Z","amount":2645},{"due_date":"2011-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":2713},{"due_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":2783},{"due_date":"2011-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":2854},{"due_date":"2011-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":2928},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":3004}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":165.52},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":169.8},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":174.15},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":178.58},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":183.18},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":187.94},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":192.69},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":197.7},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":202.77},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":207.93},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":213.25},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":218.74},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":224.38},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":230.1},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":236.07},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":242.2}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":335.32,"local_amount":4159,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:29:29Z","rounded_local_amount":4177.22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177387602},{"amount":916.54,"local_amount":11368,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T13:40:40Z","rounded_local_amount":11417.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182525498},{"amount":821.65,"local_amount":10191,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:48:36Z","rounded_local_amount":10235.65,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188660041},{"amount":1151.49,"local_amount":14282,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T02:39:51Z","rounded_local_amount":14344.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191403310}],"funded_date":"2010-10-22T15:29:13Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T02:39:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":244228,"name":"Fatimatou","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"G. est une femme de 36 ans, elle est mari\u00e9e et m\u00e8re de 3 enfants, son mari est un chauffeur de camion, elle exerce comme activit\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ratrice de revenu le commerce de  ma\u00efs, mil et sorgho. elle s\u2019approvisionne \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du pays dans le march\u00e9 local d'ani\u00e9.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

in 1962 in Ahonlogo\u00e9, Mr. Yawo A. is the father of seven children, some of whom are apprentices and others are in school. He specializes in market gardening and has a business growing chili peppers and vegetables. But when the water dries up, he can no longer run his business and has to temporarily cease trading. His ability to manage his income has, until now, allowed him to meet the needs of his household. Hoping to increase the area he farms in order to make more profit, he plans to buy a motorized pump to make it easy to water his garden. He also needs fertilizer. To do this, he is asking for a loan of $1,000. \r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n<p>\r\nN\u00e9 en 1962 \u00e0 Ahonlogo\u00e9, Monsieur A.

When she first borrowed money, she used it to breed chickens and pigs. Her income from breeding pigs and chickens was used for expanding the farm, increasing the number of animals. In 2006, Mrs. T. switched from breeding pigs and chickens to investing in building material such as bricks, cements, tiles, etc. Her store provides materials for many building projects and also satisfies local needs. Besides, she collects wasted material. In 2007, Mrs. T. was able to build a 3-storey house of 150 meter square area. This time, she wants to borrow 1200 USD to buy more bricks, sands and gravels.

She is 40 years old, and is married with two children. She puts a lot of effort into the development of her farming efforts because she is aware that they can help her children. The unconditional support that she receives from them provides her with optimism, and despite the financial shortcomings at home, she tries to alleviate those shortcomings efficiently. Her wish is to improve the living conditions of her family and is requesting a loan to increase the quality and quantity of her products. She requests 2000 Somoni ($ 600 USD). She wants to purchase seeds for wheat and onions and mineral fertilizer. Arofat is very grateful to everyone who is helping her to achieve her dreams. \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and with it\u2019s famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Marie was born around 1950 in Adjohoun, a village of Porto-Novo, the administrative and political capital of B\u00e9nin.  She is married and the mother of five children, who are all in school.  She sells various goods (soap, pasta, milk, 5-kg sacks of rice, etc.).  Her work generates income for her and allows her to cope with family expenses for a time, short though it may be.  But due to the financial means needed for acquiring supplies on time to respond effectively to the demand, Marie is losing customers.  This is why she needs a loan, so as to bolster her business and to retain her customers.  \r\n<p>\r\n<i>Alid\u00e9 means \u201cthere is always a path for the poorest\u201d in Benin\u2019s local language of Fon.

She was born on the 8th of September 1963. M. and her family live in a four-room house in the Baingo neighborhood in the Belo subdivision in the North Region of Cameroon. Because she is the breadwinner of the family, she finds it very difficult to take care of the family single handedly. In addition, she sustained a serious accident and she was robed by thieves.  Faced with her low level of education, she could not secure a good job for herself. Thus, she embarked on the sale of second-hand dresses, which she has been doing for 2 years.\n\nBecoming a member of GHAPE in 2008, she was fortunate to have acquired some techniques which have helped her to improve her business. She has proven successful with her previous loan, which she had conscientiously managed and repaid. Her business is going to help her community in that she will be able to supply the market with second-hand dresses. She plans to repay the loan in 12 months and repayment shall commence on the date of disbursement.\n\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.

clothing and a RTW (ready-to-wear clothing) business. She lives in Poblacion, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her businesses, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 7,100. \r\n\r\nDebbie is now borrowing PHP 20,000 so that she can fund her business activities. This will be her 16th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 18,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Debbie aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

She is married and has 4 children who range in age from 19 to 29.  She has a small general store where she sells office supplies, clothing, and many items that her customers buy from her with cash and on credit.  Her main customers are housewives and young people in her neighborhood and neighborhoods to the east.  She learned her business 30 years ago when she lived in the municipality of Maicao, a border area characterized by formal and informal commercial activity.  At first, she started selling clothing and toiletries that she distributed among a few customers.  When she moved to Malambo, she continued her business with the goal of helping with her family's finances.  Only her husband was contributing to their income.  He is an electrician and travels the majority of the time.  For 4 years, she has had her business in her home and although she started it without physical infrastructure, she currently has 2 display cases and a photocopier where she offers photocopying services.  This is her first loan, which she will use to strengthen her business.  With it, she will be connected to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She saw this as an excellent opportunity to start her credit history.

She is married and has four school-aged children.  To make a living, Luy\u1ebfn owns & operates a business venture in the services sector providing waste management services.  While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes from hauling second-hand goods for local businesses and community members.  Luy\u1ebfn has been engaged in this business for over five years and earns approximately 8,000,000 VND a month from these activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Luy\u1ebfn joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve  her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Luy\u1ebfn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,184,000 VND from SEDA.  This previous loan was used to purchase scrap metal to sell.  Luy\u1ebfn is now requesting a new loan of 9,632,000 VND which will be used to purchase additional scrap metal to sell.  This will be the 6th loan taken out by the borrower from SEDA.  Luy\u1ebfn plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business  to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout SEDA:\r\n\r\nThe mission of SEDA (Center of Small Enterprise Development Assistance) is to provide microfinance services to the low income and disadvantaged people in rural areas of Hanoi and the Northern provinces of Vietnam.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Mariam is proud to be the only Hajjat in the group of Nkokonjeru. Her business is buying and selling mukene (small silvery fish) from Nkombwe landing site in Ngogwe Sub County for eight years now. Before this business, Hajjat used to sell tomatoes and onions, but because they were perishables, she was always losing money.\r\n<P>\r\nWith the small fish, it\u2019s a matter of drying them properly; do so and they will last for a very long time. Mariam says the prices of the fish keep fluctuating depending on the season, and this influences her selling price. Mariam is a widow who cares for five orphans and three other orphans (her stepchildren), who are all in school; two are in candidate classes.\r\n<P>\r\nSince she started getting loans, Mariam has managed to care for her family and has bought some land for farming hence reducing the cost of buying everything including food. She has also bought some goats which she sells and has a dream of buying a cow (a good one costs about one million Uganda shillings). A cow would provide milk for sale, and Mariam hopes this will happen for her and her family soon. She plans to buy more small fish for her stock once she has access to a loan."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2200,"image":{"id":217591,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy more fish for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UG","country":"Uganda","town":"Nkokonjeru","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.3 32.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":84,"posted_date":"2008-10-28T21:30:25Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2200,"lender_count":70,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mariam","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Zalia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Babirye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Steven","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betty","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Harriet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cissy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-12T02:31:05Z","disbursal_currency":"UGX","disbursal_amount":4350000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1087500},{"due_date":"2009-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1087500},{"due_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1087500},{"due_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","amount":1087500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":550},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":550}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":550,"local_amount":1087500,"processed_date":"2008-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T02:26:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1091750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9966511},{"amount":550,"local_amount":1087500,"processed_date":"2009-01-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1091750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14882708},{"amount":550,"local_amount":1087500,"processed_date":"2009-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":1091750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20432242},{"amount":550,"local_amount":1087500,"processed_date":"2009-03-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:21:25Z","rounded_local_amount":1091750,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27126581}],"funded_date":"2008-10-29T01:31:05Z","paid_date":"2009-04-15T21:21:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jason Groce","image":null}},{"id":75430,"name":"Vu Thi Kieu","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. L. is 30 years old and lives in the Nghe An Province, in Vietnam.

She puts the damask and scarves into dyes, which she learned to do from a friend.  She has a spot at the Sikasso bus station, where she is in high demand.  Because of this location, her business is doing superbly, with her customers composed essentially of drivers and employees working there.  \r\n\r\nIn her search for supplemental financial resources, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso three years ago.  After three solidarity loans (group loans), all correctly repaid, with a women's association in her district (Association BADEYA de Sanoubougou I), she is on her second PIC (an individual commercial loan).  She intends to use this loan to buy 18 lengths of damask, 50 packets of scarves, 5 bags of caustic soda, and 5 containers dyes of different colors.  She buys the damask, caustic soda, and dyes locally, and the scarves -- in Niono by special order.  \r\n\r\nWith this loan, she envisions realizing a monthly profit of 80,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to increase her working capital and to help cover family expenses.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":255078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy clothing ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-01-15T05:00:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatoumata ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-19T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":31250},{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":31250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.63},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:28:34Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889537},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-02-15T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:13:17Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440324},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-03-17T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:09:59Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135698},{"amount":65.62,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:32:07Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033499},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620867},{"amount":65.63,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-06-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:23:21Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53019832},{"amount":65.57,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-07-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:20:48Z","rounded_local_amount":32228.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242599},{"amount":65.66,"local_amount":31250,"processed_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:44:01Z","rounded_local_amount":32228,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678122}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T11:27:18Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T22:44:01Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":87718,"name":"Nang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Nang P. lives in Pong Ror village in Kampong Cham province.

The loan will be used to buy supplies and materials necessary for the members' various businesses.

Her one big dream is to improve her family's standard of living, to have enough capital to expand her business, and to prepare her four children for a better future. Her dream started to become a reality when she became a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon.\r\n\r\nEmelinda is 52 years old and is married to Artimio G., who helps her manage their business. They have four children, aged 22 to 29 years old. Two of their children already have their own families and the other two still live at home -- one works as a seaman and other is a student.\r\n\r\nEmelinda and Artimio started out selling pork to retail customers. They bought pigs and had them butchered, and then her husband delivered the pork meat to various meat shops on consignment. This earns them a good living, but they are always on the lookout for other business opportunities, so in 2000 she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon and opened a new business selling spare parts and electronic gadgets. \r\n\r\nThey continued with their pork retail business, earning a combined monthly income of 10,000 Philippine pesos (PHP). They use their income to support their household expenses and pay for school tuition, and they have some left over for savings. Emelinda had a previous loan of 29,500 PHP, which she used for both her spare parts and her pork retail business. She repaid this loan in full within its loan term and without any delays. She is now borrowing for her 23rd cycle the same amount of 29,500 PHP. She will use this loan as additional working capital and to purchase additional spare parts inventory. \r\n\r\nIn the accompanying picture, Emelinda is shown in her spare parts and electronics business with her husband in the background.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just of a few but thousands of women. Through the alleviation program, these women have progressed from earning less than a measly $1 a day to surpassing realities beyond their dreams. This is Project Dungganon.

The group members, such as the highly sought-after Awa Traor\u00e9, sell cereals and fabric, firewood and atiek\u00e9 (a manioc-based food). Awa Traor\u00e9 aims to use her loan to buy 30 cartloads  of manioc, which will be processed to atiek\u00e9; she sources her goods from the Loulouni market and from the neighbouring villages. \r\nThe atiek\u00e9 is sold retail and wholesale for cash at the Loulouni market, to a male and female customer base. Awa envisages generating an average monthly profit of 18, 000 FCFA - a portion of this will be saved to pay for her children's education and the family's food, and the rest will be re-invested in
