He has a cabinetmaking workshop there, which came out of his experience working in a carpentry shop for 10 years. For the past 5 years he has run his own business venture, building on his experience, and has made each one of his work tools little by little and bartered his furniture for the newest tools. At his business, he makes living room sets, entertainment centers, doors, and kitchen counters in his own community and in others.

Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He is married with three children. All of his children are single and school-age. Mr. Sam has worked as a local cultivator as well as a mortar maker for many years. From mortar making, he typically earns $4.50 USD per day. His wife also assists him in the same occupation. The heavy rainfall is a good sign for him to grow rice crops.

They live, together with their five children, in their own home in the community of Camunachari.  Simona is a farmer, whose parents taught her this trade when she was a very young girl.  She has been farming and raising animals for 20 years since then.  In times of the festivities, she has hens and pigs that sell quickly, due to the good breeding and diet that she provides them.  She surpasses the competition and, for this reason, she has good profits.  What she likes most about her job is buying her animals when they are very young and then watching them grow large and robust with time.  What she considers the most difficult is when the animals contract diseases as this may place the others at risk.  In the future, she hopes to buy new animals in order to increase production.  This will be her second loan with MFP; she feels that the money from the loan will help a lot with the progress of her business.

She is a woman with great desires to succeed, so she holds various jobs but the most important is selling beverages and food at the entrance of the market, something she has done for 2 years. Thanks to an opportunity that they provided her she installed her stand and has large earnings, as she is located in a very highly frequented area. Now, in the summer, people are going to the market more frequently, but to be there the greatest number of hours Lucila has to prepare her refreshments and food early in order to be in her stand and start selling at midday, to then return home very tired but content because of the work she has completed.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Rodel has been engaged in this business for over 4 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Rodel joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rodel is requesting a loan of 5000 PHP which will be used to repair a transport vehicle used in the business. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Rodel from ASKI.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

They decided to give it that name because that is the name of the neighborhood they live in and also because they are very united women.  This story is about Mrs.Marisela L\u00f3pez Hern\u00e1ndez, who is a part of this group. She is married and has two children, a 3 year old son and a 9 year old girl. Her daughter goes to elementary school and Marisela has been selling handmade tortillas for a year. \r\n \r\nMarisela decided to start this business out of neccesity. She wasn't financially stable enough to educate her 2 children. She decided to invest the loan in purchasing more ingredients for the torilla preparation, such as: corn and firewood, which are the most indispensable things.  \r\n \r\nHer business is benefitting her a lot since with her earnings she is able to pay for her children's education. She is also saving up to invest in a locale to be able to open a tortilla shop and provide work for the people in her community.    \r\n \r\nShe wants to keep investing in the business to open her tortilla shop and she also wants to keep supporting her children so that they can keep going to school and finish their studies and have a better future. \r\n \r\nShe remarks that all of her fellow members are responsible people who make their payments. They all know each other and have no problems among themselves. She says that she is very grateful to the Kiva lenders and to FRAC, since thanks to them she is getting ahead and has been able to have her own business, and support her children's educations. \r\n\r\nThe people in the Mariposas de la Posta group and the activities they invested their loan in are:  \r\n\r\nDivina G.

She is 46 years old and the group leader of a fifteen-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Leticia F.'s group.\r\n\r\nLeticia is married and has three adult-aged children. To make a living, she owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. She has been engaged in her business for over nineteen years and earns approximately $138 a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Leticia joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. \r\n\r\nLeticia is requesting a new loan of 20,000 PHP which again will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 4th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to continue to improve her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolk and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3050,"image":{"id":705921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General

is a 49-year-old widow who supports her family by operating a general store.

With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Roqueta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 11,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to buy soft drinks, rice, canned goods etc for her general store so that she can continue to save up for the future expansion of her business.

He is a simple man and lives in his own house with his wife, Marlene.  They have been married for two years but had lived together for 12 years before tying the knot.  They have two children, Luis and Maycol, who they care for lovingly.  The Cayan farm lands are known for their different variety of potatoes.  There Emilio began growing potatoes eight years ago and puts into practice everthing he learned from his parents.  He plants twice a year.  The first during the rainy season when crops grow without having to be watered, and the second in the watering season when they grow any time but with irrigation.\r\n\r\nWhat he enjoys most about his work is taking care of his produce because he feels like he has done a good job each harvest time when he goes to the wholesale market in town.  He also has two young oxen (3 years old) that he uses to plow the fields.  He plows for himself and for others who pay him extras money, around S\/.60 per day.  He is now preparing to plant the \"andina\" variety and is sure he will get good results.  He belongs to the communal bank \"Coraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas\" and this is his second loan through MFP, where he counts on your help for his projects.  He is committed to paying back the loan on time.  The loan will be used to buy various sacks of organic fertilizer to begin planting his \"yungay\" potato.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":807028,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"To buy several sacks of organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-11T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":750,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Emilio ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":11,"loan_amount":750,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-17T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":750}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":750,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:46Z","rounded_local_amount":2061.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098513}],"funded_date":"2011-07-12T07:56:23Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:27:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":318424,"name":"Cesar Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El Sr. Cesar es un cliente antiguo, vive en la zona el Tejar vive en la casa de  su madre en la misma direcci\u00f3n tiene su taller de soldar escapes don cesar esta muy contento de  haber sido  aprobado su cr\u00e9dito El Sr. cesar esta  casado con la se\u00f1ora Noem\u00ed que tambi\u00e9n tiene su propia actividad  ella vende caf\u00e9 tiene un puesto en la misma avenida.

is divorced and has two children. Her main source of income is from a small business she runs selling sewing, quilting and embroidery supplies in one of the local markets.

Financial assistance has promoted growth in her sales and the expansion of her business. Competitive prices and top-quality merchandise have helped her gain many loyal customers. Currently, Alla has about $2,800 of working capital. Her monthly net profit amounts to $500.   \r\n\r\nAlla would like to receive a loan of $900 to increase her working capital. \tShe is planning to purchase buttons, fringe, elastic, feathers, lace and sequin trims, thread, zippers, needles and pins in bulk for further retail sale. Alla believes a wide assortment of ethnic textiles, dancewear fabrics, beads and different accessories will attract many more potential clients to her kiosk.

pesticide-selling venture. During that season, Bahodir acquired adequate income which was used to improve his home and saved for the children\u2019s education expenses. Since during the season he was diligently selling fertilizer, his land is nearly derelict. The current rainy season is an appropriate time for planting. Bahodir has taken the initiative to resume working on his land while selling fertilizer. He requires funds to purchase farm supplies such as seeds and fertilizer. Bahodir is optimistic his venture will be successful and all the effort he has expended will better the family\u2019s welfare.   \r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets as: Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":750,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":750,"image":{"id":319840,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

She wants to grow to become a clothing distributor and expand her sales to a larger area.\r\n\r\nPlease help us support Carmen and the rest of this group with this Kiva loan. Thank you!\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":328550,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more clothes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"DO","country":"Dominican Republic","town":"San Pedro de Macor\u00eds","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"19 -70.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":44,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:29Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Blas ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rufina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Regina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Evelin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"DOP","disbursal_amount":35000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-27T07:00:00Z","amount":2904.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2906.61},{"due_date":"2009-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2908.84},{"due_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":2911.07},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2913.3},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":2915.54},{"due_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","amount":2917.77},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":2920.01},{"due_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":2922.25},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":2924.49},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":2926.74},{"due_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":2929}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.91},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.97},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.03},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.09},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.16},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.22},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.28},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.34},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.41},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.47},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.53},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.59}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":291.86,"local_amount":10477.13,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:12:34Z","rounded_local_amount":10477.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52951040},{"amount":32.14,"local_amount":1153.77,"processed_date":"2009-07-08T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:03:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1153.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63168223},{"amount":81.16,"local_amount":2913.3,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:07:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2913.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63168224},{"amount":81.22,"local_amount":2915.54,"processed_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:23:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2915.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73593488},{"amount":81.28,"local_amount":2917.77,"processed_date":"2009-08-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:29:40Z","rounded_local_amount":2917.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73593489},{"amount":81.34,"local_amount":2920.01,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:02:30Z","rounded_local_amount":2920.23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87028834},{"amount":81.41,"local_amount":2922.25,"processed_date":"2009-09-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:09:43Z","rounded_local_amount":2922.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87028835},{"amount":81.47,"local_amount":2924.49,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:16:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2924.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87028836},{"amount":81.53,"local_amount":2926.74,"processed_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T19:19:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2926.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96940874},{"amount":81.59,"local_amount":2929,"processed_date":"2009-10-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-15T19:35:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2929.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96940875}],"funded_date":"2009-06-10T01:53:14Z","paid_date":"2009-11-15T19:35:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jeff Avery","image":233371}},{"id":116810,"name":"Maria","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Maria is 44 years old, married and has four children.

The care that she takes feeding the animals and supplying them with occasional medical visits from the veterinarian has increased their population and so now she guides them into the field each day for feeding.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nCarmelita is married and has three school-aged children. To make a living, Carmelita runs a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. Carmelita has been engaged in her business for over seven years and earns approximately 5,000 Philippine pesos a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Carmelita joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Carmelita has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. Carmelita is requesting a new loan of 9,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase new items to expand her product offering. This will be the third loan taken out by Carmelita from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\n<b>About ASKI:<\/b>\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful micro-finance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva. Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and

The house is located in the La Holleria sector, one of many rural areas of the Morrope district of the Lambayeque Province, one hour from the town of Chiclayo.\r\n\r\nHe is a potter by trade, crafting clay pots and pans by request of a middle man who comes to take his products every now and then. With money he had saved he opened a general store in his home. That is where he and his wife attend their customers and offer them basic good for which they would otherwise have to travel to the central village (20 minutes away) to get. \r\n\r\nHe also has a construction job but just as with his pottery job, it is not a permanent position. Because of that, Jose strives as best he can to move ahead with his business. Currently he wishes to expand it by buying more inventory and has requested Edpyme Alternative a loan for 1,500 nuevos soles. \r\n\r\nJose has worked before with Kiva and with our bank. Thanks to his previous loan he was able to supply his general store with inventory and increase his income. He is thankful to the people who supported him the first time and wishes to keep working to accomplish his goals and move ahead. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Betyna Almeida-Covarrubias, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":550,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":550,"image":{"id":470836,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of basic goods to expand general store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Caser\u00edo La Holleria - C.

This is a great activity for parties, corporate gatherings or church events because so many people can participate at one time. Jason D. used this loan to buy two consoles and two generators.\r\n\r\nJason has been a serial entrepreneur since he was 11 years old when he started mowing grass for people in his community. By the time he was 18 years old, he ran a lawn care service making $600 a day, 3 days a week, \u201cYou can imagine the kind of trouble I got in\u201d, says Jason. Jason subsequently attempted to start two other businesses which did not take off. He says, \u201cI will be a serial entrepreneur until I\u2019m successful and I will keep trying. I have ideas all the time.\u201d\r\n\r\nJason started working for Perot Systems, which is now under Dell, as an analyst. He currently works for Dell and has recently had another entrepreneurial urge. He kept all of his landscaping materials so that when his three sons were old enough, they could start landscaping themselves. It was important to Jason that his sons learn a trade and he therefore created another business, Cowboy Irrigation. Every Saturday, Jason was teaching his kids how to irrigate, but they said, \u201cDad, this irrigation stuff is hard. Why can\u2019t we do something else?\u201d Jason told his children, \u201cLet\u2019s think about what you\u2019re good at, and then let\u2019s figure out a way to make money from that.\u201d Out of this discussion, Jason and his kids developed the idea for Gameboys.  \r\n\r\nJason\u2019s kids, Jack, Trent, Beau and Shealan, had invaluable input in designing the trailers. \u201cThis is me being a father and finding a way to be involved with my kids and teach them something that is productive. My purpose in life is to give them the best possible chance of being successful. I\u2019ve led by example.\u201d\r\n\r\nJason\u2019s bank referred him to ACCION Texas-Louisiana and Jason was shocked by the reasonable interest rate. Jason says, \u201cThere are a lot of people out there who have great ideas. We need people and companies that will stand behind those people\u2026. I applaud ACCION for finding avenues to trust me.\u201d\r\n\r\nJason eventually would like to build these mobile video game trailers and sell them to franchises and help them set up across the country.

Its members are Victoria, who will use the loan to buy corn and corn husks to make tamales, Aleja and Edna who will buy seasonal fruit like avocadoes, pomegranates and peaches, Minerva who will buy piglets to fatten up and Luisa who will buy flour, sugar and yeast.\r\n\r\nLuisa is 55 years old.  She completed second grade.  She\u2019s married and has 9 children, all married and independent.  She sells bread and is asking for the loan to buy flour, sugar, shortening, firewood, eggs, butter and yeast.  She offers her customers sweet bread, \u201cteleras\u201d (rolls used to make tortas) and \u201cbolillos\u201d (French rolls).\r\n\r\nShe started her business 30 years ago because of need and poverty.  She already had little children and her mother-in-law taught her how to make bread.  She used to help her make it and she stared little by little to make bread and gradually grew.  Now, she sells more.  With money earned by her husband working in the fields she bought raw materials to start the business.  Now her husband and son help her make the bread and she goes to downtown Jumiltepec to set up her sales stand to sell it.\r\n\r\nHer business is important because she gets income to cover needs and for food.  She is proud because she has many customers that buy her bread because they like the flavor of the bread they make with such joy.\r\n\r\nThe challenges she faces are the high price of ingredients.  She uses profits from the business for food, to pay back the loan and part as savings.  \r\n\r\nShe is happy with the loan that she\u2019ll get that she\u2019ll use to buy ingredients to make bread.  It will strengthen her business.  Her dreams and hopes are to stay in business making and selling bread and that her children have everything good that life has to offer.\r\n\r\nJumiltepec is a pretty town with mild temperature.  There is a lot of vegetation.  Fruits like avocadoes, peaches, pears, vines, \u2018capulines\u2019 (similar to sour cherries) abound.  Residents celebrate February 2 as \u201cOur Lady of Candlemas\u201d day.  Food is prepared for all the pilgrims who climb the hill where the Virgin of Candlemas chapel es located.

She is married and has one eleven-year-old child.  Maria owns a photography business where she takes pictures for a variety of local events.  She has been a photographer for 20 years.  <p>\r\nClotilde is 59 years old.  She is a widow and has six children between the ages of twenty-four and thirty-six.  Cotilde travels 10 hours to Lima every three or four months to buy clothing, which she sells in the city of Ayacucho.  She has this business for 18 months.  Previously, in the 1980s, she owned a small grocery store, but do to civil unrest and astronomic levels of inflation she was forced to close.  <p>\r\nAmerica is 30 years old.  She travels to different markets in the region selling clothing, which she buys in Lima.  She has had this business for one year.

called Hialeah.  Walter is a professional photographer; he is married and his wife sells clothing and cosmetics.  They have three children aged 12, 14, and 16 years who are all students and help at home.  Walter wishes to finish construction of his home with this, his fifth loan.  He has used previous loans for home improvements and to provide greater security for his family.  Because of a lack of capital, he has been unable to invest in his business as he would have liked.  He started twenty years ago taking photos during the civil war in the eighties as he was working as a photographer for the counter-revolutionaries which was quite an experience as it was risky, but it was his work.  His goal in business is to gain more clients and offer his services, so that he can make enough money to meet the needs of his family.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":229476,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","themes":null,"use":"To buy construction materials to plaster and repair his home.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Managua","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.150833 -86.268333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":98,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Walter Mauricio","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-21T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":48.15,"local_amount":912.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-15T09:58:18Z","rounded_local_amount":953.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9893546},{"amount":48.5,"local_amount":919.03,"processed_date":"2009-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T09:23:27Z","rounded_local_amount":960.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14816641},{"amount":45.84,"local_amount":868.64,"processed_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-15T08:21:57Z","rounded_local_amount":907.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20351330},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-03-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T09:07:01Z","rounded_local_amount":940.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27038663},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-04-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T09:43:46Z","rounded_local_amount":940.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35928961},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-05-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T20:21:55Z","rounded_local_amount":940.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44383884},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T16:28:05Z","rounded_local_amount":940.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52890356},{"amount":47.51,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-07-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T09:35:53Z","rounded_local_amount":940.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63111669},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-08-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T09:44:49Z","rounded_local_amount":940.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73533099},{"amount":47.5,"local_amount":900,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T09:52:17Z","rounded_local_amount":940.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":86964511}],"funded_date":"2008-12-23T01:49:01Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T09:52:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":79962,"name":"Edalia","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Edalia tiene 36 a\u00f1os, vive con su esposo y sus  6 hijos.

Most of them live in monogamous families in Mancourani I, a district of Sikasso City (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  They do a diversity of work, including selling fabrics, Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West African cloth), fruit, firewood, beauty products, etc.  \r\n\r\nCollaborating with the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso in order to satisfy customer needs and to increase their profits, the group members are on their third solidarity loan, after having correctly repaid the preceding two.  With this new loan, they intend to buy 3 cart-loads of firewood, 25 bolts of Wax <i>pagnes<\/i>, 6 bunches of bananas, 10 basins of mangoes, 10 outfits for children, and 15 packages of beauty products.  Supplies are gotten at the grand marketplace of Bamako, from M\u00e9dine in Sikasso City, and in neighboring towns.  The merchandise is sold mostly in cash transactions at different marketplaces of Sikasso, within families, to customers composed of men and women.\r\n\r\nThe group members each envision realizing an average monthly profit of 20,000 francs CFA.  A portion of the profits will be used for family needs, and the other portion will be invested in business and for repaying the loan.  Their ambition is to become wholesale merchants.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":525,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":525,"image":{"id":319860,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy various goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:23Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":525,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maimouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Makani","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Aichatou ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariam ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":250000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":525,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":105},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":105}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:22:35Z","rounded_local_amount":50522.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020265},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:20:10Z","rounded_local_amount":50522.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63243020},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":50522.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678829},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:56:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50522.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112630},{"amount":105,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:09:27Z","rounded_local_amount":50522.78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028197}],"funded_date":"2009-06-02T10:05:51Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T07:09:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":112730,"name":"Emelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Emelyn manages an eatery business in the public market of Cauayan City.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Evelyn has been engaged in her business for over two years and earns approximately 9,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Evelyn joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Evelyn has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used as her additional working capital. Evelyn is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase more ready-to-wear clothes to sell. This loan will be the second loan taken out by Evelyn from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines.

A married mother of two adult-aged children, L. owns and operates a butcher shop whose main income is derived from butchering and selling pork in the local community.  Engaged in this business for over 21 years, she earns approximately 3.200.000 VND a month.<p>\r\n\r\nIn 2009, L. joined SEDA to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities.  Having repaid her previous loan of 5.152.000 VND from SEDA that was used to invest in expanding the business, she is now requesting a new loan, her second, of 8.288.000 VND to purchase additional inventory and use as working capital.

Elsa successfully repaid a previous loan of 9,000 PHP from ASKI. This previous loan was used to purchase additional products to sell. She is requesting a new loan of 11,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be her 4th loan from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 29 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Following the example of the other group members, her goal is to buy a mill with her savings through this partnership with Soro Yiriwaso."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2100,"image":{"id":702655,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy plastic cookware (cups, bowls, and pots)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"S\u00e9gou","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"17 -4","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:33Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2100,"lender_count":56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Dj\u00e8n\u00e8ba     Mah    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Habibatou                   ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Heleine                 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tenin                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Foun\u00e8                       ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa                ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Magnama                     ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sitan        Dia          ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Bintou      Bah    ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"S\u00e9tou               ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-01-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.67},{"due_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":166666.65}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":350}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":350,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2011-02-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:19:59Z","rounded_local_amount":167558.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195918220},{"amount":350,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2011-03-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T12:12:36Z","rounded_local_amount":167558.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201361179},{"amount":350,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2011-04-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:48:26Z","rounded_local_amount":167558.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206226461},{"amount":350,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2011-05-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T12:00:00Z","rounded_local_amount":167558.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211301301},{"amount":350,"local_amount":166666.67,"processed_date":"2011-06-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:51:58Z","rounded_local_amount":167558.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216580882},{"amount":350,"local_amount":166666.65,"processed_date":"2011-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:17Z","rounded_local_amount":167558.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221750706}],"funded_date":"2011-02-06T16:11:37Z","paid_date":"2011-08-15T09:30:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":273378,"name":"Lita","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Lita L. is from the village of Bolisong, Kinoguitan, Misamis Oriental.

Allan has been buying and selling tropical fruits like bananas and pineapples for quite some time now.  He buys these fruits in bulk from wholesalers and sells them individually for profits.  On average, he earns approximately 11,000 PHP of net income per month. <p>\r\n\r\nTo help him continue operations of his business, he is requesting a loan in the amount of 14,000 PHP ($325).  He plans to use the loan proceeds to purchase more fresh fruits to replenish his current inventory. Allan expects a boost in his business income as he expands his business in this fashion. <p>\r\n\r\nIt is his fervent prayer to live a life of abundance and good health together with his entire family.

She lives with her partner, the father of her 2 children, in the home of her in-laws.\r\n<p>\r\nSince starting her family, Nilda has been in the business of breeding and selling small animals (guinea pigs and rabbits).  Every Thursday and Sunday she brings 8 to 12 guinea pigs to market in the town of Tarma.   Most of the time, each guinea pig sells for 10 or 12 soles while a rabbit sells for 25 soles.  Her sales come to an end when competing merchants start liquidating and lower their prices to 8 soles per guinea pig and 15 soles per rabbit.  Before returning home, she stops to buy food concentrates to fatten her remaining animals. \r\n<p>\r\nMeanwhile, Nilda\u2019s husband is engaged in the planting of potatoes and peas.  She sometimes helps with the planting, but her main responsibility comes at harvest time when she is responsible for gathering the potatoes.  Nilda is very happy with her business, so she is eager to buy more animals and acquire more farmland to grow oats for animal feed. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is her tenth loan with MFP. During her previous loan periods, she was punctual with her payments.  She is respected by her communal bank group and gets along well with the other members.

same purpose in the amounts of 7.000,00MT and 16.000,00MT, which were paid without any issues.\r\n\r\nShe plans to pay back the loan without incident to be able to access further loans and achieve her goal of seeing her house finished and equipped.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Portuguese by Michele Magrino, Kiva

For this reason, she is choosing to seek financing to buy basic grains, candy, sodas, and dairy products so that she can attract customers.

In 2009 he took out his first Kiva micro-loan through ACCION USA. In only seven months since his first loan he has already increased his sales by 50%, opened up a storefront, and is now married.\r\n\r\nJoshua works full-time in his business and has been able to increase his income. He will continue doing online sales but would like to focus on his storefront and designing a new website.\r\n\r\nJoshua will be using his second micro-loan to purchase a new computer that will help him process orders more efficiently, and to purchase new inventory. \r\n\r\n\r\n About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2475,"image":{"id":537592,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing

Five of the children are currently attending school.\r\n\r\nAndrew has requested this loan from Juhudi Kilimo of 45,000 Kenyan Shillings to purchase and insure a dairy cow.

She earns her living by operating 2 business ventures:  buying and selling fruit and selling Avon products.  Her husband Pepito, who is 47 years old, earns a living as a carpenter and also helps with his wife's business activities.  They have three children between 5 to 12 years old. \r\n\r\nVicenta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1999 because she aspired for something better for her family.  With the help of her past 9 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Vicenta  has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 12,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, improving the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 10th loan cycle, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use as additional working capital for fruit-selling and for livestock.  This will allow her to continue to save for the future education of her children.  Vicenta Paradeo is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  \r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable).

The majority of these products are clothes, such as jackets and blouses, which are purchased in the city and sold in the country.  There are no stores of any kind in the country, leaving the rural populations to depend on feriantes like Sady for all their purchases. This is why, every single day, Sady makes the 2 hour trip to the country with a large load of clothing. She carries mostly smaller items such as blouses and skirts because it allows her to carry much larger quantities, which allows her to sell to a much larger client base.\r\n\r\nFor the past 2 years, Sady has been involved in the \u201cferiante\u201d business. Her mother is involved in the same trade, buying and selling a special type of colorful skirt, traditional to Ayacucho, Peru. Sady passionately explains that the motivation to continue working so hard everyday in such an incredibly tiring profession comes from her two children. She diligently saves her money in the bank in anticipation of funding the education of her 1 and 4 year old all the way through university. Education is the most important gift Sady could possibly give to her sons, she explains, and the only way to surpass poverty in the long run. Professionally, Sady is working towards opening a clothing store in the city of Ayacucho. This has been a dream of hers for some time now and would allow her to travel less and spend more time with her children as they grow up. \r\n\r\nSady has been involved in her village bank for the past 2 years, ever since she was invited by her mother, who has been taking out loans from there for more than 10 years. Apart from the huge economic help the bank has provided, she loves the knowledge she has gained from the weekly classes and all the friendships she has made. Sady is currently requesting a loan of $300. With this money she will buy even larger quantities of clothing to sell, allowing her to generating a larger client base and ultimately a larger profit."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":94290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To buy even larger quantities of clothing to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2007-12-07T23:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sady Yanina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-22T00:31:46Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":890,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":222.5},{"due_date":"2008-02-21T08:00:00Z","amount":222.5},{"due_date":"2008-03-21T07:00:00Z","amount":222.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":222.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.5,"processed_date":"2008-01-22T10:15:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":224.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":120124},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.5,"processed_date":"2008-02-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":224.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":140287},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.5,"processed_date":"2008-03-22T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":224.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":163856},{"amount":75,"local_amount":222.5,"processed_date":"2008-04-22T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-22T09:36:37Z","rounded_local_amount":224.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188845}],"funded_date":"2007-12-08T00:31:46Z","paid_date":"2008-04-22T09:10:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":30819,"name":"Naseem's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"My name is Naseem A.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Cuando ella inici\u00f3 esta actividad no hab\u00eda terminando su bachillerato y lo hizo ayudando a ni\u00f1os de sus vecinas sin cobrarle dinero, pero ellos llevaban los pupitres donde sentarse; poco a poco con el nivel de progreso de estos ni\u00f1os,  muchas madres tomasinas  requer\u00edan de sus servicios;  fue as\u00ed como decidi\u00f3  con la ayuda de ellos, ampliar los salones y  adecuar lo que hoy son 3 salones, donde los ni\u00f1os aprenden en un mejor espacio. Por eso en aras de continuar brind\u00e1ndole un mejor ambiente formativo a los ni\u00f1os, solicita un cr\u00e9dito por valor de $2.000.000 que  invertir\u00e1 en adecuaciones de sus instalaciones como: repellar paredes, cambiar la cubierta, adecuar las zonas h\u00famedas, e invertir en meriendas econ\u00f3micas y sanas para ofrecer a sus peque\u00f1os.\nSu sue\u00f1o a mediano plazo es ampliar la cobertura y entrar al sistema educativo formal, para lo cual se est\u00e1 preparando, pues aunque no tiene hijos biol\u00f3gicos, su vocaci\u00f3n maternal y educadora,  est\u00e1 volcada especialmente  hacia los ni\u00f1os y los que est\u00e1n  en su proyecto de escuela, no son la excepci\u00f3n; en este sentido ella estimula la finalizaci\u00f3n de sus niveles integr\u00e1ndolos con sus padres, mediante peque\u00f1as ceremonias de cumplimiento de logros, con la que todos se sienten muy felices de su progreso, especialmente \u201cLa Se\u00f1o\u201d como todos la conocen en Santo Tom\u00e1s.\n\n","en":"Mar\u00eda Mercedes P.

To her, Santo Tomas is a municipality of people willing to help each other and even outsiders; they like festivals and that is why they have the Carnaval Intermunicipal del Atl\u00e1ntico that integrates the entire Department; but beyond dancing, the \u201cTomasino\u201d (as people from Santo Tomas are called) is a human being who likes to study and has great capacity to improve herself or himself. \r\nMar\u00eda Mercedes has a facility next to her house where she takes care and prepares children to get through pre-kinder, kinder, and transition period; she also conducts activities to reinforce and compliment the work of students brought by their parents; the students are coached to exceed their school achievements through guided work. She had not finished high school when she started this line of work, and she begun by helping the neighbor\u2019s children without charging them, but they brought their own desks to sit on; little by little, with the level of progress achieved by these children, many \u201ctomasina\u201d mothers sought her services; for this reason and with their help, she decided to expand the classrooms and she equipped what are now 3 classrooms, where the children learn in a better space. In the interest of continuing to bring a better learning environment, she is requesting a loan of $2.000.000 that she will invest in improvements of her facilities, such as: plaster walls, change roof cover, accommodate ecological areas and buy inexpensive and healthy snacks for her children.\r\nHer mid-term dream is to expand the coverage and enter the educational system officially, for which she is preparing; even though she has no biological children, her calling as a mother and a teacher is completely dedicated to the children, and the ones in her school project are no exception. She stimulates the completion of the different levels by integrating the children with their parents through small ceremonies for fulfilled achievements, in which all participants feel happy with the progress, especially \u201cLa Se\u00f1o\u201d, as she is known by everybody in Santo Tom\u00e1s.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Carlos Morales, Kiva

She plans to use the additional revenue to financially support immediate members of her family. \r\n\r\nMiriam is the leader of a 12 member group accessing a loan offered by ASKI.

She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 400 talas or about $167 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Mele joined SPBD. This is her first loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Mele's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\n<b>About  SPBD<\/b> \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.
