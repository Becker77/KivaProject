","en":"Telica, one of the principal municipalities of the city of Leon, where the streets are made of cobblestone, the houses of adobe, and the roofs of tile, is precisely where Edgar is from. He is a simple but hardworking businessman, 40 years old, a father of a family, and married. He has three children who are 18, 17, and 6 years old. The oldest of his children is taking the first year of an accounting course. His second child is in the third year of high school and his youngest child attends kindergarten. His wife is a housewife but she helps him with his retail clothing business.\r\n\r\nEdgar rents a small place near the town church where he sells clothing for children, juniors, and adults, including pants, blouses, shorts, and men's shirts. Every day he leaves his home carrying all his merchandise to fit it all into his humble carts and begin to sell--to be able to gather his strength and supply for the needs of his family. He tells us that he started this business three years ago with some savings he had, as before that he worked in the city's mayor's office and also worked for different companies. But the scarcity of work became intense and he couldn't get a formal job so he decided to start his own business when he saw very few possibilities of getting work. The needs of his family couldn't wait, and thank God it has gone well for him and this is how he earns a living and gets his children ahead.\r\n\r\nHe needs the loan to buy new clothing such as shirts, men's and women's jeans, blouses, girdles, t-shirts, and trousers. The Christmas season is coming and he wants to take advantage to sell all of his merchandise, in this way improving his sales to pay off his debt and invest in buying mannequins, display cases, and more variety of merchandise to sell. In the future he would like to have his own place to create a clothing store and hire people to help him sell."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":920498,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"to buy new clothes such as shirts, men's and women's jeans, blouses, girdles, t-shirts, and trousers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2011-11-18T19:50:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Edgar Francisco\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-20T08:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2012-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2012-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.34},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":333.33},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":333.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":333.34,"local_amount":333.34,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:47:44Z","rounded_local_amount":333.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250832707},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:16:06Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257242629},{"amount":333.33,"local_amount":333.33,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:42Z","rounded_local_amount":333.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263381900}],"funded_date":"2011-11-18T23:56:59Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T10:27:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tamara Hellgren","image":null}},{"id":363225,"name":"Fe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Fe is 52 years old and lives in the Philippines.

This allows him to earn up to 30 soles a day, and on a good day he can earn up to 50 soles, which helps him with additional household expenses.  He believes his business is doing well because he does a good job and, thanks to this, his customers recommend his service to others.\r\n<p>\r\nHe is infinitely thankful to Kiva lenders because, thanks to their support, he is going to be able to buy 2 electric machines.

She is an active member of Queen Esther Group and has benefited a lot from the group through loans she has been getting. Her first loan from KIVA of USD 300 enabled her to install electricity in her rental rooms. This lead to increment of monthly charges from USD 7 to USD10. She was also able to install power in her house which made a significant change in her life. Her family was touched by the loan because since she got married she had not seen electricity in her house. The whole family was touched by the loan and their living standard changed abit. Her grandchildren work as a team and they grow varieties of vegetables for sale and they help her in loan repayment. She supports the children with the income she get from rental rooms and she has housed them. She believes knowledge is power, thus it\u2019s her responsibility to pay fees for her grandchildren as their father is not bothered.

Annamary M. is a 52-year-old widow with four children. Her children are between the ages of 19 and 34 years old. In 2004 Annamary established a bar and she now seeks a loan in order to purchase additional stocks of beer, liquor, and soft drinks. Undoubtedly, Coca Cola\u00ae is one of the most recognized symbols or 'words\" in the world. Even in the most remote villages in Africa, there is usually some kind of \"bar\" selling Coke, Fanta, and Guinness; Annamary notes that Pepsi has made it to most African capitals but not to the less-populated areas, but she is sure that Pepsi is working on expanding into those areas too!). The hot weather makes soft drinks all the more appealing, which explains why selling soft drinks is such a popular venture regardless of whether you\u2019re the CEO of Coca Cola Ltd. in the United States or a micro-entrepreneur in Tanzania!\r\n\r\nAbout SELFINA:\r\nSELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through leasing and leaseback facilities as a practical way to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women. SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services. SELFINA thanks you for your support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":123260,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pub","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To

Her general store has been in business for three years. She noticed that this business was a good opportunity for her because there is a bus stop for a transportation company near her house, and the drivers are always looking for food to eat throughout the day. Thus, Adelaida and her husband decided to put their savings together and open a general store. It started out with only a few goods, but as time went by, it has grown. Adelaida would like to keep expanding her business because it contributes to the education of her children\u2014the most important people in her life. The problem she is currently facing is that the road on which both her house and the bus stop is located is being repaired, but when the road work is finished, the drivers will once again come through there. This is the first time that Adelaida requests a loan from MFP. She was invited to join her microfinance institute because her desire for self-improvement and her responsibility in managing her finances are evident. She will invest this loan in purchasing more goods for her general store. She will purchase yogurt and other drinks in wholesale bulk, which cost 50.00 PEN each, as well as sacks of legumes, rice and sugar, among other products.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elizabeth Casian, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":255419,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Increase goods","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-15T08:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adelaida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":167},{"due_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":165}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.28},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.6}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-01-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:09:44Z","rounded_local_amount":168.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228391},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-02-23T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:08:09Z","rounded_local_amount":168.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423626},{"amount":54.28,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-03-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:40:10Z","rounded_local_amount":168.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116894},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:49:52Z","rounded_local_amount":168.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011816},{"amount":54.27,"local_amount":167,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:59:34Z","rounded_local_amount":168.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595409},{"amount":53.62,"local_amount":165,"processed_date":"2009-06-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":166.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989650}],"funded_date":"2009-01-15T12:15:43Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:43:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elizabeth Casian","image":845142}},{"id":87828,"name":"Salvador","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1or Salvador A. acaba de adquirir su vivienda por medio de un cr\u00e9dito gubernamental.

She is married with 4 children and lives in a rural area where there are no jobs. Her main sources of income are agriculture and the remittances that her elder son sends from Russia. However, due to the economic crisis, for the past two months he has not sent any money. Mahabbat sold a bull and was planning to buy a dairy cow but then she realized that keeping a cow would be even more expensive. Therefore she came to Microinvest to inquire about the conditions of the loan. Having received the loan, she bought a cow. Now she already owns several dairy cows.

The main source of income for the business comes from selling daily use products such as shampoo, soap and toothpaste, in the local community. Elvie has been engaged in her business for over a year and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month from these activities.\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2009, Elvie joined Kiva partner, GDMPC, to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Elvie has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from GDMPC. This loan was used to invest in expanding her business. Elvie is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be her second from GDMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve her family's general living conditions. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>About GDMPC<\/b><br>\r\nGDMPC is one of the most progressive cooperatives in Mindanao, Philippines.

P. is 24 years old and resides in San Pedro Perulapan in Cuscatl\u00e1n. William lives with his wife and owns a bakery, having approximately four years experience. William puts all his efforts towards producing bread seven days a week, for which he's well known. He provides bread to many shops in his area but, unfortunately, his production is coming up short each time when compared with the demand that he has. It is for this that he is requesting this loan to buy a new oven that will allow him to produce more bread.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kate Divjak, Kiva

She owns a business venture, planting & harvesting taro for sale.  Folo has many years of experience in this business.  Folo needs a loan of WST $1500 to invest in expanding the business.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 600 talas or US $250 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Folo joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Folo's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Folo M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

This loan will be the second loan taken out by Emily from PMPC.

Her previous loan of PHP15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom.

Her business is the traditional one of making all types of clothing, but mostly school uniforms and outfits for women, and pants.  Since 1995 when she began the business with her daughter with 10 sewing machines and her son-in-law who was in charge of marketing strategy, she has succeeded in getting a lot of business from customers.  For 5 years the results of this business were very good, but her daughter lost her husband  and Maria Cristina couldn't continue working the same way because her daughter got involved in other things, so her sales dropped.\r\n\r\nMaria Cristina has an overlock sewing machine and an industrial machine, and although she handles contracts with businesses and department stores, her market is more domestic with the making of uniforms, multiuse clothing and items taken on order.\r\n\r\nHer goal for the future is to expand the market and generate higher earnings, although her big problem is insufficient working capital to make it happen.

Maksudakhon works at a local school and is known as a principled and demanding teacher.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a teacher's salary is not high, so Maksudakhon decided in parallel with her main work to do a trade business. Using a sum of 20,000 Kyrgyz Som (KGS) as starting capital, Maksudakhon made every effort to develop the activities -- she harvest and purchases apples from the local population for resale. For these purposes, a specially sealed barn was built, where fruits are stored at a certain temperature and a car was purchased for transportation to the local market. This allows Maksudakhon to earn a monthly profit of 20,000 som. \r\n\r\nIn order to further develop her business, \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0445\u043e\u043d contacted the company Bai-Tushum and Partners for a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) to buy five tons of apples. Procurement of these goods will allow her to expand the number of customers and increase sales. In the future, Maksudakhon plans to build a large warehouse for storage of fruit."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2150,"image":{"id":929350,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fruits & Vegetables","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase fruits for resale","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Nookat town","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2011-11-28T18:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2150,"lender_count":64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maksudakhon","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":100000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":2150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1075}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1075,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-16T08:14:31Z","rounded_local_amount":50170.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276816161},{"amount":1075,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-15T11:07:11Z","rounded_local_amount":50170.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":283072186}],"funded_date":"2011-12-17T14:46:46Z","paid_date":"2012-06-15T11:07:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"JD Bergeron","image":1751016}},{"id":367337,"name":"Everline","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Everline is a married woman with 3 children, 2 of whom attend school while 1 is still too young for school.

She has two children between the ages of 15 and 17 whom she loves much too much.  They are now in the fifth year of secondary school, and Rosy is very proud of them.  Her husband, a miner, lives with her.  He supports her a lot, and he is her right hand in everything.\r\n\r\nRosy lives in Caman\u00e1, an oasis on the other side of the long and dry Sechura desert, which dominates the coast in the southeastern part of Peru. Caman\u00e1 has historically been an important tourist destination in Peru. Nevertheless, the frequent and strong earthquakes and tsunamis in the past decade (an 8.4 in 2001 and an 8.0 in 2007) decimated the city, destroying the tourist industry in Caman\u00e1 and costing many of the residents their jobs.\r\n\r\nThe result of unemployment is that it creates an atmosphere that is ready for microfinance.  Its beaches, which are beautiful, are Caman\u00e1\u2019s most striking feature.  As it is well-known, Per\u00fa is known for having the most delicious food in the world.  One of the dishes that Rosy likes a lot is \u201cPescado Frito\u201d (fried fish).\r\n\r\nRosy only went to school until the fourth year of secondary school because her parents did not have adequate finances.  However, she would have liked to study cosmetology.\r\n\r\nRosy sells groceries.  She devotes about ten hours a day to her business, waiting on an average of approximately 40 people.  In one day she is able to earn up to 50 soles.  However on a very good day she is able to earn 60 soles.  This helps her with the additional household expenses.  She believes that her business is going well for her thanks to her friendly treatment of the customers and because she offers good quality products.\r\n\r\nShe is currently more than pleased with the Kiva lenders.  Thanks to the support they have given her she will be able to buy more products to offer in her business.  Because it is the Christmas season she will buy Christmas products to offer her customers.  She will have a much greater variety, and this will improve her business.  That will give her more income and improve her quality of life.

Y por si no fuera poco ella ayuda a su esposo en la venta del restaurant que tienen solo los fines de semana, este esfuerzo les est\u00e1 permitiendo salir adelante.\n\nUna de las debilidades que afronta actualmente Graciela es que no cuenta con un monto de dinero considerable para por generar la compra al por mayor de algunos abarrotes como  arroz, aceite, az\u00facar, gaseosas, dulces, etc. es por eso que desea que los prestatarios Kiva puedan ayudarla con un pr\u00e9stamo de S\/.1,000.00 y as\u00ed ella pueda comprar los abarrotes que necesita a un precio muy c\u00f3modo. Sabe que si ella hace buen uso del dinero podr\u00e1 llegar a su meta, la misma que consiste en que su hija contin\u00fae estudiando y tener una nueva y mejor bodega.\n","en":"Graciela is a 51-year-old woman who has six children.  She currently lives just with her youngest 11-year-old because all her other daughters are adults living independently.  She is a hardworking woman who very much wants to get ahead and see her young daughter become a good professional.  Her husband, who is a merchant at a restaurant located near the beach in the city of Mala, gives her unconditional support.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Graciela works on average 12 hours a day hoping to generate the necessary income for the home and to buy new and better products.  Her daughter helps her every day.  Graciela believes that the main reason why she has so many customers is the charisma and good humor her daughter has while helping her in the grocery store they have.  This business allows her to earn a daily income of 50 soles but if there is a lot of public she can earn up to 80 soles.  This profit is attained because she tends to an average of 12 customers daily.  If that weren\u2019t enough, she helps her husband with the sales in the restaurant which they only have on weekends.  This effort has made it possible for them to get ahead.\r\n\r\nOne of the weaknesses Graciela faces currently is that she does not have a considerable amount of capital available to be able to buy supplies like rice, oil, sugar, soft-drinks, candy, etc. at wholesale and this is why she\u2019d like Kiva lenders to help her with a loan of 1,000 soles so that she can buy the groceries she needs at a more comfortable price.  She knows that if she makes good use of the money she\u2019ll reach her goal which is that he daughter continues going to school and to have a new and better store.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":978555,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy stock merchandise for her store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Mala","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":139,"posted_date":"2012-01-13T19:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Graciela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":67.03},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":71.85},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":72.25},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":75.94},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":77.82},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":81.55},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":83.82},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":86.98},{"due_date":"2012-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":90.73},{"due_date":"2012-11-06T08:00:00Z","amount":93.67},{"due_date":"2012-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":97.45},{"due_date":"2013-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":100.91}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":25.14},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.94},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.09},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.48},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":29.18},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.59},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.43},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.62},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.02},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35.13},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.54},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.84}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":25.14,"local_amount":67.03,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:57:23Z","rounded_local_amount":67.67,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263271195},{"amount":26.94,"local_amount":71.85,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:45:14Z","rounded_local_amount":72.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269993845},{"amount":322.92,"local_amount":861.12,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T08:58:29Z","rounded_local_amount":869.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276601751}],"funded_date":"2012-01-18T01:04:46Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T08:58:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":383726,"name":"G.s.

Hawa thanks you for your support! <p>\r\n\r\nABOUT SELFINA: SELFINA is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback micro-finance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normA. make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are not considered to be credit-worthy by financial institutions because they lack tangible assets that can serve as collateral. As such, low income women in Tanzania typicA. receive poor financial support and in turn only limited access to basic needs and services. Fortunately, SELFINA has been a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing to achieve the economic and social emancipation of women in Tanzania. Simply put, SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women through an arrangement called a sale and leaseback transaction. More specificA., when a client needs working capital, SELFINA buys equipment from said client, extends a loan to her to facilitate the transaction, and then leases the equipment back to her. As such, one of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":239655,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To expand her business by purchasing additional women's cosmetics","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2008-12-16T22:50:30Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hawa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-15T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-02-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:02:46Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20436341},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:21Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130613},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:23:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027410},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:03Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613411},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:16Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010491},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:37:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232788},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:51:56Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664604},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:06Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105335},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:24:39Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022480},{"amount":42.5,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:29Z","rounded_local_amount":52700,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867730}],"funded_date":"2008-12-17T15:17:17Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Craig Kaufman","image":null}},{"id":83748,"name":"Antonia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Antonia is a member of the Suni (\u201cStrength\u201d in Quechua) Village Bank.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

She owns a business venture, selling ice-cakes (flavored ice in styrofoam cups).  Leutogi  has 2 years of experience in this business.  Leutogi  needs a loan of WST $1250 to buy sugar, styrofoam cups, and codial (flavoring).  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Leutogi  joined SPBD.  This is her 2nd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Leutogi 's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Leutogi  A. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

He buys his phones from a Nigerian wholesaler, and says that one day he'd like to be able to import phones from China himself and sell them wholesale.\r\n\r\nAdolphus is 32 years old and married.

Thanks to his wide experience in cultivating vegetables, he was able to open a selling point at the local market, which became known for its high quality products. With the starting capital of 5,000 KGS, he managed to earn about 15,000 KGS in a month.\r\n\r\nNow Baktybek has applied for a loan of 50,000 KGS to broaden the assortment of goods by purchasing garlic and cucumbers.

She lives with Nilton, her partner of 12 years.  They have two daughters, Tatiana and Jocelyn. She started farming at an early age, since \"agriculture\" is the main economic activity in the area.  But for the last 12 years, she and her husband have been farming coffee, avocados, and bananas independently. Every morning, they drive to their fields, where they clean, plant, and harvest their crops.  When the crops are ready, they sell them to Alicia, who has a depot in the area.  From there, their fruit is taken around the country.   What they like about the work is that they can be together as a family for most of the day.  But they hate seeing their crops ruined by the weather.  At the moment, they have begun the coffee harvest; they will use the money they get to improve their home and thereby give their children a better quality of life.  \r\n\r\nElsa is a member of the \"Flor de caf\u00e9\" community bank, and this is her third loan with MFP.  She promises to pay her installments on time, as she has always done before.  She is glad to be part of the community bank because all the members are responsible and very friendly people,  She will use the loan to buy bags of organic fertilizer to spread around her coffee plants and \"island\"-variety bananas.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":788369,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Green"],"use":"to buy bags of organic fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-06-13T18:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elsa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-05-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-06-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2020.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270098484}],"funded_date":"2011-06-13T21:39:12Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T10:29:17Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ross Forman","image":1172721}},{"id":309951,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan is married and is 47 years old.

Cows are never raised for beef, but for their milk, from which curd (duy) and fresh cheese (paneer) are made. Jersey cows are the preferred breed for milking. On average, a dairy cow in Nepal will produce about 10 liters of milk each day.  In the local market, a liter of milk sells for about USD $0.50. In addition to producing milk, cows provide dung that is used in home construction, as fuel for fires, and can be captured in methane storage tanks. The purchase of a dairy cow, made possible through a Kiva loan, is an investment that will repay itself many times over.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":450,"image":{"id":825141,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Milk Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a young cow.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NP","country":"Nepal","town":"SainbuBhaishepati","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"28 84","type":"point"}},"partner_id":62,"posted_date":"2011-07-29T17:00:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":450,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.36,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nirmala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NPR","disbursal_amount":30000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":450,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-09-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-10-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-11-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2011-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-01-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-04-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-05-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-06-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500},{"due_date":"2012-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-19T08:18:14Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227594796},{"amount":75,"local_amount":5000,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T11:18:11Z","rounded_local_amount":5259,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238691536},{"amount":36.77,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:05:59Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.73,"payment_id":244647901},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-29T09:03:29Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250865033},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:13Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257275018},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-30T07:55:22Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263416484},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-25T08:04:17Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270131285},{"amount":36.65,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-26T08:27:37Z","rounded_local_amount":2629.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.85,"payment_id":276947086},{"amount":106.72,"local_amount":7500,"processed_date":"2012-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-06-26T08:09:56Z","rounded_local_amount":7888.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.78,"payment_id":283296478}],"funded_date":"2011-07-29T21:45:41Z","paid_date":"2012-06-26T08:09:56Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Tammea Arthur","image":1739710}},{"id":326345,"name":"Rufina","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Rufina se dedica a la venta de comida espec\u00edficamente sopa de pescado y su esposo trabaja como ayudante de alba\u00f1il.

Maria saw a great opportunity in her community to open a phone center, where the locals could go to her phone booths and make calls. This is a particularly good business in these sectors of Guayaquil because people cannot afford to install phone lines in their homes. Therefore, these phone call centers are very popular throughout Guayaquil, especially because they also offer the ability to make international calls to family members who are overseas which can be very expensive, even for those who do have phone lines. <\/p>  \r\n\r\n<p>Maria\u2019s husband has been extremely supportive in this new venture. They slowly accumulated their savings in order to buy the substantial start up investments necessary to launch this business. Maria now wants to put in two computers that have internet connections. Before she can do this she has to add a gate to her entrance and put in an alarm system in order to deter criminals from robbing her. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maria has four children, one of which works at the business at night.

His wife only draws a meager income from her work.  In his household are three people, including two children, all of whom are his responsibility.  Educated through secondary school, he farms as his principal business activity, something he had formal training in.  And it has done the trick for him financially.  But the soil is poor, and it must be  fertilized and otherwise treated.  This requires money he does not have.  And so he is requesting a loan of $950 to stock fertilizer for a successful harvest.  The income will allow him to take better care of his children's health, nourishment, and schooling.  \r\n<p> <b>Translated from French by Daniel Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/b><p> \r\n\r\nN\u00e9 en 1962, Monsieur M.

She lives with her kids in Ashaiman, a suburb of Tema in the Greater Accra region of Ghana. Ramatu loves selling goods, the business through which she makes a living. More specifically, for the past 8 years, she has been trading goods such as maize, groundnuts, and millet in the Ashaiman market. Notably, she treks to Yendi (in the northern part of Ghana) to purchase her goods in bulk from farmers, and she then resells such goods to her customers. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, she does not have an adequate amount of working capital to purchase enough goods to generate sufficient profits to support her family. As such, she is seeking a loan to purchase additional goods (e.g., maize, groundnuts, millet, and sweet potatoes) in bulk and to thereby increase her sales.

She earns her living by making native handicrafts such as bags, wallets, baskets, etc. from pandan and by fishing.\r\n\r\nVergie\u2019s husband Jose, who is 47 years old, is a fisherman and sometimes helps her run the business. They have 2 children who are 16 and 18 years old. The older one helps her parents in business and the younger one is currently going to school.\r\n\r\nVergie joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life of their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD she has been able to increase their family income by making native products made from pandan leaves and from fishing. Now she earns an average monthly income of Php 8,000 from her business activities.\r\n\r\nVergie is a member of good standing. Her previous loan of Php 9,500 was used to fund operations of her native products and fishing, and it had a positive impact in both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is borrowing for her 12th loan, the amount of Php 10,500, which she intends to use to sustain the operations of her handicrafts production and also help fund the fishing operations of her husband.  Vergie is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which is to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest

He is 49 years-old. Carolino is married to Dulcineta, his business partner and  they are blessed with two children who are both studying in college. To make a living, they sell chemicals wholesale and retail and most specifically \u201chypo\u201d (calcium hypochlorite) and chlorine to be used for cleaning, disinfecting and for anti-stain. They\u2019ve had this business for ten years  and earn approximately 2,600 PHP a month from this buy and sell activity. \r\n\r\n In 2009, Carolino joined Kiva partner PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve his living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Carolino is now requesting a second loan of 7,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional stocks of hypo for their business.

Now, the couple is earning an average net income of not less than Php 3,000 a month which is so helpful to their family.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, upon hearing the good news about Paglaum MPC being one of the most outstanding cooperatives in northern Mindanao (awarded for being the Most Outstanding Cooperative in the Philippines during the search for the COOP-LGU Partnership Award in 2006) Lydia joined the cooperative.\r\n\r\nAs an active member of the PDP-LP (Paglaum Development Program for Landless People) program of Paglaum MPC, a micro-finance program that reaches out to the rural poor, Lydia has successfully repaid a loan of Php 3,000.\r\n\r\nLydia is now requesting a loan of Php 5,000 as her 7th loan, to be used as additional capital for her doormats and okay-okay business. The future income from this loan will be used to improve the living conditions for her family, to meet their basic needs, for loan repayments to PMPC, savings, insurances, her grandchildren\u2019s education and for possible business expansions.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model.\r\n\r\n\r\n<font size=\"1\"> <b>*Note:<\/b> To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

Despues de un tiempo Luz decidi\u00f3 dedicarse a la venta de condimentos, y aprendi\u00f3 de una de sus hermanas. \n\nSus hijos la ayudan a preparar los condimientos y luego ella sale a las Aldeas cercanas a venderlos, se transporta a jalon por alguien conocido. Las ventas las realiza cada 15 dias pero en su casa vende de forma permanente. Sus mayores dificultades son el clima y que cuando no encuentra a nadie que le de jalon tiene que caminar grandes distancias. \n\nCon el apoyo del prestamo comprar\u00e1 condimentos como ser: achiote, especias, canela, clavos de olor, romero, linaza, y tambien comprar bolsitas, grapas para el empaque. Con el apoyo de este prestamo podr\u00e1 surtir su negocio y espera que sus ventas aumenten. \n\nSu meta es seguir apoyando a sus hijos para que estos se graduen, dos de ellos ya lo hicieron gracias a su esfuerzo laboral.

Luz is 43 years old and a single mother of four children.  She lives together with her children in San Nicol\u00e1s community.  Many years ago, her father loaned her some money which she used to buy second-hand clothing to sell to her neighbors.  Her sales made her some profits and so she bought some more merchandise.  After a while, Luz decided to start selling seasonings and learned from one of her sisters.  \r\n\r\nLuz's children help her to prepare her seasonings and then she goes out to nearby villages to sell them.  She hitches a lift with somebody she knows.  She makes these sales every two weeks but she sells from her home all the time.  Luz's main difficulties are the weather and when she can't find somebody to give her a ride because this means she has to walk long distances.\r\n\r\nWith the support of this loan, Luz will buy seasonings such as annatto, spices, cinnamon, cloves, rosemary and linseed.  She will also buy small bags and staples with which to package them.  With the support of this loan, she will be able to stock her business and she hopes that her sales will increase.\r\n\r\nLuz's goal is to continue supporting her children so that they graduate.  Two of her children have already done this thanks to her work.  Luz has been a FAMA client for more than 15 loan cycles and she has been very punctual in making her loan repayments."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2575,"image":{"id":864523,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase seasonings.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Juticalpa, Olancho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":168,"posted_date":"2011-11-20T13:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2575,"lender_count":81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Luz Benita ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Elvia Rosa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nanci Jakeline ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rosa Celenia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Leidy Liceira ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Suyapa Argentina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Wendy Geraldina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatima Yolesmy ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yohana Lizeth ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":false}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":48500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":12125},{"due_date":"2012-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":12125},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":12125},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":12125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":643.75},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":643.75},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":643.75},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":643.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":1287.5,"local_amount":24250,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:52:50Z","rounded_local_amount":24398.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250758119},{"amount":1287.5,"local_amount":24250,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":24398.12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257165404}],"funded_date":"2011-11-20T21:33:27Z","paid_date":"2012-02-15T10:03:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":363273,"name":"Jessivel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jessivel is 32 years old and lives in the Philippines.

El problema m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil que enfrenta es que no tiene una vivienda propia, y los directivos de la escuela le dieron permiso para que construyera una habitaci\u00f3n dentro de las instalaciones de la misma y gracias a los pr\u00e9stamos obtenidos en FAMA pudo hacerlo, aunque la habitacion es muy peque\u00f1a para su familia. Su reto es ahorrar aunque sea de poco en poco para comprar un solar y poder construir su casa, seguir manteniendo a su familia porque hace dos a\u00f1os su esposo muri\u00f3 y no tiene ning\u00fan otro soporte econ\u00f3mico. Elbia solicita el pr\u00e9stamo para comprar papas, chiles, cebollas, zanahorias, pataste, repollo, coliflor, brocoli, entre otras verduras. y as\u00ed ofrecer una mayor variedad de productos a sus clientes. Una de sus ventajas es que su hijo mayor le ayuda a transportar en una carreta las verduras desde la escuela hasta el mayoreo y no tiene que pagar transporte ni empleado porque \u00e9l tambi\u00e9n le ayuda a atender a los clientes. Con el apoyo del pr\u00e9stamo espera obtener mejores ganancias para ahorrar un poco, seguir llevando el alimento a su casa y seguir pagando el estudio de sus cuatro hijos menores.

Elbia is one of the members.  She\u2019s 51 years old, a widow, and has five children.  She has a steady job as a school advisor from Monday to Friday and sells vegetables on the weekends.  Her biggest problem is that she doesn\u2019t have her own home and the school managers have allowed her to set up living quarters within the school.  Thanks to the loans she\u2019s gotten through FAMA, she\u2019s been able to set it up, although it\u2019s too small for her family.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a challenge for her to save money, but she\u2019s saving a little at a time to buy a lot on which to build, while continuing to support her family.  Her husband died two years ago and she has no other means of financial support.\r\n\r\nElbia is asking for this loan in order to buy potatoes, peppers, onions, carrots, chayote squash, cauliflower, broccoli, and other vegetables, so that she can offer the greatest variety of products to her customers.  One of her advantages is that her oldest son helps her transport her vegetables from the school to the marker in his cart, so she doesn\u2019t have to pay for transportation or for an employee because he also helps to serve the customers.\r\n\r\nWith the support of this loan, she hopes to increase her income to be able to save a bit, continue feeding her family, and continue paying for her four youngest children\u2019s school expenses.  Her dream is to also have a place to sell clothing so that she can have another source of income and be able to build her house and graduate her children.\r\n\r\nElbia feels very grateful because this loan she obtained through FAMA has allowed her to improve her financial situation.

Their goal is to increase their capital to buy better quality packaging and improve the presentation of their products so they can reach more demanding markets and buy more supplies to increase their production, so they can create more income for the good of their children.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Spanish by N.D., Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\n\r\nEn la ciudad de El Alto  se encuentra a la asociaci\u00f3n \u201c\u00c1guilas de Oro\u201d que trabaja junto a la familia de Pro-Mujer con mucha responsabilidad un grupo muy simp\u00e1tico y unido sobre todo.

Fatmata was born in Makeni, in northern Sierra Leone. She is married to a businessman and the two have two children. One is in secondary school and the other has dropped out of school and is now training to become a motor mechanic. Fatmata sells cloth: cottons and \u201cLaise\u201d cottons. She has been in business for over twenty years now. She began the business when she was a little child with her mum. This will be her very first loan from SMT. She is requesting a loan of Le 3,000,000 to help her strengthen her business.<P>\r\n\r\nWith this loan, Fatmata will expand her business by buying two bales of cottons to add to her current stock. She will need additional money from her capital to enable her to buy the two bales. A bale of cotton in Freetown costs Le 1,500,000 and a bale of Laise cotton costs Le 1,700,000.  The fare to Freetown is Le 24,000 round trip. There is a Le 1000 delivery charge for each bale transported with her from Freetown.  <P>\r\n\r\nBusiness is going fine for Fatmata. The only challenge she has been facing is that of low capital, but with the loan she now receives from SMT, that challenge has been overcome. With this loan she receives from SMT, Fatmata is expecting a vast improvement in her business and an incremental increase in the amount of profit she makes. The increase in profit will make her feel good.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":975,"image":{"id":267783,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":["Conflict Zones"],"use":"Buy one bale of cotton and one bale of laise cotton","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SL","country":"Sierra Leone","town":"Makeni","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8.883333 -12.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":57,"posted_date":"2009-02-09T15:40:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":975,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Fatmata","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-05T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"SLL","disbursal_amount":3000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2009-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2009-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2009-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","amount":300000},{"due_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":300000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":97.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":121.87,"local_amount":375000,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-17T07:56:31Z","rounded_local_amount":376590.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20434528},{"amount":73.12,"local_amount":225000,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:10:08Z","rounded_local_amount":225954.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36025726},{"amount":170.63,"local_amount":525000,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T23:54:11Z","rounded_local_amount":527226.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53008529},{"amount":121.88,"local_amount":375000,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":376590.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63230866},{"amount":195,"local_amount":600000,"processed_date":"2009-09-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:16:07Z","rounded_local_amount":602545,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87102872},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2009-10-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:02:24Z","rounded_local_amount":301272.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97019888},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2009-11-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:34:53Z","rounded_local_amount":301272.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103864733},{"amount":97.5,"local_amount":300000,"processed_date":"2009-12-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:36:55Z","rounded_local_amount":301272.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110754542}],"funded_date":"2009-02-09T23:24:13Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:36:55Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":91972,"name":"Chanry","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Chanry T. lives in Angk village, Kandal province.

For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

ago, he found that demand for the products he carried grew quickly. He can attribute much of his success since then to excellent rapport with his customers and high receptiveness to their suggestions. \u201cI receive a lot of help from my customers. In this business, particularly, you have to treat people well, and then they\u2019ll come back.\u201d \r\n\r\nBefore he began selling \u201ceverything for the woman,\u201d as he describes it, Javier worked in construction and sold vegetables at the market, but he had a strong desire to be his own boss. He knew that he had the customer service skills, as well as the strong work ethic, to open his own stall. Javier sells his products at the market on the weekend, and works at a factory full-time during the week. He explains that he gets anxious if he has too much free time on his hands and enjoys his full work schedule. \r\n\r\nJavier learned about Opportunity Fund years ago from a friend that also operates a stall. This is Javier\u2019s second loan with Opportunity Fund, and he will use the $4,500 to increase his inventory. By making monthly trips to Los Angeles, he will be able to purchase more goods at a cheaper price to bring back to his customers in San Jose. He hopes that the loan and his increased earnings will allow him to hire an employee to help manage the stall.

Cruz, Tangub City. She is married to Manolo M., a carpenter, and is blessed with three children who all are now of school age.\r\n\r\nTo help her husband in supporting their family, Lilia decided to engage in business. She has a sari-sari (variety) store located near the government elementary school of her village. For six years, already, she has been able to manage her business and now she is earning an average net income of not less than P3,500 a month, which is so helpful to her family income.\r\n\r\nLilia joined the cooperative in 2007. As an active member of the PDP-LP Program (Paglaum Development Program for Landless People) of Paglaum MPC, a micro-finance program that reaches out to the rural poor, she was able to obtain multiple loan amounts. Her previous loan was P14,900.\r\n\r\nThis time, Lilia is requesting P20,000 as her 7th loan to add to the capital of her sari-sari store. The future income from this loan will be used to improve the living conditions of her family, to meet their basic needs, and for the education of her children for their better future.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About PMPC:<\/b>\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

He lives with his wife, Cecilia, and his four children. His oldest son works with him on the farm to grow their products, while the other three still go to school. He is a native of Salitre and has been raised in agriculture his entire life. He also has a small butcher shop in the small town of Salitre. He hopes that with this loan he will be able to invest in feed for his cattle and possibly buy some more steers. With the profits he will continue to educate his kids and feed his family.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":35635,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Farm Rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-11T18:01:31Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Carlos","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-29T01:26:17Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-28T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-12T22:26:06Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T20:26:20Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31436},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:30:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T20:26:20Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40410},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T19:48:45Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T20:26:20Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53270},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-29T23:29:39Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T20:26:20Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73634},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T00:38:21Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T20:26:20Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":88538},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T17:46:46Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-18T20:26:20Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99034}],"funded_date":"2007-05-15T01:26:17Z","paid_date":"2007-12-18T17:46:47Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14140,"name":"Alia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Alia lives in district 15 of Kabul, Afghanistan.

Having lacked the chance to go to school due to societal reasons, she tried many kinds of work to earn an income.  Seven years ago, she opted for commerce in various goods, buying and selling Wax <i>pagnes<\/i> (colorful West Africa cloth), kitchen utensils (\"Super\" basins, nickel basins, frying pans, etc.)  She is in high demand by her customers (composed essentially of women) for the quality of her goods.  Given that her shop is located on the roadside of one of the busiest arteries in town, and it has easy access, her business is booming.  And her customers are very satisfied.\r\n<p>\r\nWanting to do better in satisfying this ever-growing customer base, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso over six years ago.  After six solidarity loans (group loans) in a women's association in her area, she is now on her eighth individual loan.  All the preceding loans have been correctly repaid.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe intends to use this loan to buy five bolts of Wax <i>pagnes<\/i>, three sets of \"Super\" basins, four wristwatches, a dozen frying pans, five handbags, and ten dolls.   The merchandise is gotten in Dakar (Republic of Senegal) and is resold in her shop in Sikasso.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 150,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to augment her working capital, to help cover family expenses, to pay the loan interest, and to invest the rest in her business.  <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":290078,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy various goods ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2009-04-01T07:00:27Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Assitan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":28571.43},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":28571.43},{"due_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":28571.43},{"due_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","amount":28571.43},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":28571.43},{"due_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":28571.43},{"due_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":28571.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.14},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":57.14,"local_amount":28571.43,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:18Z","rounded_local_amount":28760.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033730},{"amount":57.14,"local_amount":28571.43,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:50Z","rounded_local_amount":28760.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44621097},{"amount":57.14,"local_amount":28571.43,"processed_date":"2009-06-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:21:29Z","rounded_local_amount":28760.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53020063},{"amount":57.14,"local_amount":28571.43,"processed_date":"2009-07-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T19:19:04Z","rounded_local_amount":28760.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63242808},{"amount":57.14,"local_amount":28571.43,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T22:42:18Z","rounded_local_amount":28760.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73678417},{"amount":57.14,"local_amount":28571.43,"processed_date":"2009-09-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T03:55:05Z","rounded_local_amount":28760.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87112456},{"amount":57.16,"local_amount":28571.42,"processed_date":"2009-10-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T07:07:59Z","rounded_local_amount":28760.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97028103}],"funded_date":"2009-04-05T22:57:31Z","paid_date":"2009-11-16T07:07:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":100180,"name":"Rebeca Noemi","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La sra.

To make a living, Glenda farms rice and has been doing so for over 23 years, earning approximately 4,000 PHP a month.  Glenda joined ASKI last year to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Glenda has successfully repaid a 7,500 PHP loan from ASKI and is now requesting a second loan of 14,000 PHP to be used to purchase fertilizers.\r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

sub-prefecture of the Koulkioro region (the second administrative region of Mali).\r\n\r\nThey know each other as relatives and neighbors; their line of business is selling food condiments, clothing and shoes. The Tiesseri group is on their third solidarity loan; the women excel at their business retailing condiments, fabrics and shoes. \r\n\r\nMinata S., one of the group members, plans to use her part of the loan to purchase packs of food condiments. She usually stocks up in Bamako and sells her wares from her home, at the Fana market and at other nearby markets, retail, for cash and on credit, to a customer base composed of both women and men. She plans to achieve a monthly income of 40,000 West African Francs, which will be used toward everyday family expenses, with the rest reinvested in her business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from
