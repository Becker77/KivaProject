She operates his shop in his absence but mainly she stays at home and does her household responsibilities.  \r\n\r\nShe has applied for a loan from Asasah to help her son in expanding his grocery store business. With the loan investment, he will buy grocery items to sell through his shop.  \r\n\r\nNaseem is hopeful that her son will be able to increase his income by making positive use of the loan money.

She is a woman that has always worked hard to advance in life. She lives in her own home together with her son Oswaldo, 40 years old. What she wants most is to have a comfortable old age. Together with her son she works the fields every day. With a great deal of effort she has managed to keep her fields productive. She cultivates all kinds of things now, taking pride that every product will be of the highest quality. Her principal plantation is potatoes, alfalfa, and sweet peas. These are the products that sell best in the markets. Her favorite part of the work is warding her plantations for insects that may harm them. She has 44 years experience in the field. The most difficult part is having to transport the harvest all the way to the wholesale markets in Tarma, where she sells her products. In the future she hopes to purchase more land to increase her production. This is her sixth loan with MFP (Kiva Field Partner) and she sees this loan as a great help in the development of her business. She is a very responsible and proud member in her community bank. With the two thousand nuevos soles she requests she will purchase fertilizer to improve the productivity of her fields. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Erika Lindig, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":597341,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase fertilizer.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-09-08T19:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juana ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:09Z","rounded_local_amount":2029.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206195552}],"funded_date":"2010-09-11T12:18:07Z","paid_date":"2011-05-15T11:32:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":233940,"name":"Cleofe","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Cleofe E. is from the town of Banga.

With the help of her past loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Lilia has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 14,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 9,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  \n\nThis time, for her eighth loan, she is borrowing PHP 17,000, which she intends to use as additional capital for selling fruits and vegetables so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children.

Petrovka. She was born in the Osh region (south of Kyrgyzstan) in a farming family, and from the early years was involved in growing fruit and vegetables that were then sold at the local market. At the same time the family raised calves, sheep and goats for sale, and this constituted their main source of income.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, Aida graduated from hight school and began to study for a job as a seamstress. Upon completing her studies, she worked for two years in the \"Ak-Kuu\" sewing factory. Over time, her close relatives began relocating to the Chuisk region in the north of the country. This was caused by the fact that in the area where they had lived, very little land was allocated per family member - a family would have 6-10 hundredths of a hectare (roughly one quarter of an acre), which didn't allow to produce sufficient harvest. Meanwhile, agriculture was the main source of income in the countryside where manufacturing and industry were not developed.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Aida's family moved to the village of Petrovka in the Chuisk region, where they live to this day. Having moved to this new location, the family experienced many difficulties - living in a rented apartment, they engaged in farming, cultivating watermelons, peppers and tomatoes. After two years, Aida's family could finally buy a house. Today, Aida is engaged in raising cattle - she keeps two cows and sells the milk to producers of dairy products, which brings her around 10,000 som per month. In order to expand her business, Aida has turned to Bai Tushum & Partners for a loan of 80,000 som (KGS) to purchase more cattle. Aida plans to use her revenues to repair the house.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1725,"image":{"id":983824,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cattle","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase more cattle","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KG","country":"Kyrgyzstan","town":"Petrovka village, Chui region","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"41 75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":171,"posted_date":"2012-01-17T02:50:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1725,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aida","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-12-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KGS","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":1725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-23T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-23T07:00:00Z","amount":40000},{"due_date":"2012-07-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":40000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":862.5},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":862.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":862.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T08:30:26Z","rounded_local_amount":40387.43,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287370811},{"amount":862.5,"local_amount":40000,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T12:18:09Z","rounded_local_amount":40387.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":322938422}],"funded_date":"2012-01-17T11:25:50Z","paid_date":"2012-12-15T12:18:09Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Nikita Avvakumov","image":945112}},{"id":750896,"name":"Chantrea","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"A villager from a rural area located in the Battambang province\u2019s Bovel district, Chantrea is 32 years old and married with three children.

He is still single. He abandoned his studies during high school and became an auto mechanic. He had trouble working because he did not have the financial means to open a garage. To earn his daily wages, he was forced to help a friend who has opened a small computer training centre. He quickly took interest in computing and initiated himself rapidly. This passion for computing led him to open his own multi service centre in Lom\u00e9 in the Super Taco area. With his three previous loans obtained and repaid without incident, he has succeeded in opening his own computing and word processing centre with some secondhand equipment. However, in order to work with an increasing and insistent clientele, he needs to upgrade his computer equipment.\r\n\r\n<p>To achieve this, Mr. Komi K. is asking for a loan of $1200, which will serve to acquire a personal computer and to re-outfit his centre.

Il prit go\u00fbt rapidement \u00e0 l\u2019informatique et s\u2019initia tr\u00e8s vite. Cette passion pour l\u2019informatique le pousse \u00e0 ouvrir son propre centre de multi service \u00e0 Lom\u00e9 dans le quartier Super Taco. Avec ses trois cr\u00e9dits obtenus et r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement  rembours\u00e9s, il est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 ouvrir son propre centre informatique et de traitement de texte avec quelques mat\u00e9riels d\u2019occasion.

For this reason the few boxes that Nancy owns are a great limitation.  Nancy hopes to count on your collaboration in order to increase her production.  She needs a loan that she will invest exclusively in the purchase of boxes and other materials to facilitate the transport of fruit.\r\n\r\n<p><b>Translated from Spanish by Debra Faszer-McMahon, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\n\r\nNancy, se dedica al dep\u00f3sito de frutas para  seleccionarlas y ser luego trasportadas a las ciudad de Santa Ana   y    a la capital de su pa\u00eds.

Maquiling, Sagay City Negros Occidental. Her husband helps her in managing their diversified microbusinesses. They have three children and hope that all their children will be able to earn college degrees and get good jobs so that they can have comfortable lives.\r\n\r\nTo help her husband achieve this dream, she is helping him in their meat vending business. She sells pork and beef meat in the local market. They also buy and sell livestock, such as pigs, cows, carabaos (water buffalos) and many others. They go around the nearby villages and towns to buy livestock and then resell them for meat processing. \r\n\r\nDory joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 1997, in order to have access to loans to help Dory and her husband sustain their business activities. With the help of loans, she also put put a Carinderia (an eatery) as another source of income for their family, and was also able to buy a small piece of rice land, which her husband now farms. Dory earns an average income of 36,000 PHP per month, some of which she adds to her revolving working capital and saves for the education of their children, after spending for their household expenses.\r\n\r\nHer previous loan of 35,000 PHP contributed a lot to expanding the businesses. She used it as additional working capital for her meat vending business and as revolving capital to buy livestock. The said amount was fully paid on time without any delay. Now Dory is borrowing 40,000 PHP, which she intends to use as revolving capital to buy livestock and as additional capital for her food business. She plans to use the income from this loan to start another business so that she can save for a better future for her family.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros  Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the  lives of thousands of women through Project \"Dungganon\" (a Hiligaynon word that means \"Honorable\"). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

L. is a 38-year-old mother of five from Sarapiqui, Heredia, located near the Caribbean region of Costa Rica. Her highest level of formal education attained is the completion of primary school. Maria is a member of a group of women with the name Banco Mujer La Esperanza, which translates as \u201cThe Women\u2019s Bank of Hope\u201d. \r\n\r\nMaria\u2019s entrepreneurial idea is the rearing and selling of pigs. She will use this loan to start her business by investing in animal feed and piglets and to make general investments conducive to maintaining the good health of her animals.\r\n\r\nThe land Maria and her family live on was allocated to them by the Costa Rican government\u2019s Instituto de Desarollo Agrario which translates as \u201cThe Institute of Agrarian Development (IDA)\u201d. Through the IDA, the poorest citizens of the country were given land to live on and use for subsistence purposes such as farming and animal rearing. Many IDA land recipients have faced challenges in being able to effectively use their land due to a lack of agricultural knowledge and a lack of startup capital. Fundacion Mujer acts as an extension of the IDA program by providing much needed loans as startup capital for investment in various productive activities.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the amount of time it will take in order for the pigs to grow to a profitable value, Maria will be not be required to make immediate repayments. This means she will only repay once, at the end of the loan term.\r\n\r\nThe values Maria expects to be displayed by the group are responsibility and punctuality. She hopes to expand her business in an effort to earn more income and provide a better standard of living for her children. Specifically, she would like to be able to finance their studies.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":489009,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Underfunded

Narantsetseg operates a small shoe shop at the local market in her town. She retired from her career in 2007; however, she has worked at the market selling imported goods and operating her current shoe business to supplement her income.

Furthermore, Narantsetseg previously received a 1,000,000 tugrug (~ 705 USD) loan from XacBank, and used the loan funds to effectively expand her business. Narantsetseg is a very open and hardworking person. The most important thing to her is being able to provide for her children's education. She says, \u201cMy two daughters will graduate soon and my son plans to enroll in university after high school. I want to ensure that I can financially support them.\" Narantsetseg hopes to continue to expand her business in the future. She is now making plans to open a small shop from which to sell Korean products next year.

Her two children, ages 19 and 21, are the inner force that pushes her to work harder each day and increase her income through a small business. She receives financial support for her business from ASHI loans. In 1997, she opened a small variety store with a loan.  At the time, she only sold a few items. Despite the small scale, Irenea has been able to make a small profit from her store. Making a profit from her store allowed her to augment her husband's income from working as an electrician. Their combined income enabled her to support the needs of her two children, especially their education.\r\n\r\nOver the years, Irenea\u2019s business has grown a bit through the support of loans received from ASHI. Using the proceeds of her business she was able to finance her eldest child to attend college.  Irenea is supporting the needs of her children, especially those of the 19 year old, who only finished high school. Irenea never gets tired of supporting her family because it keeps her alive. She wants to increase her store's profit by expanding her variety store into a huge grocery store.  This would allow her to support the education of her youngest child if he considers going back to school and attending college.

She is 57 years old. Julia is married and has 4 adult children. To make a living, Julia owns & operates a sari-sari (variety) retail shop. The main source of income for the business comes from selling both food & daily use products in the local community. Julia has been engaged in her business for over 8 years and earns approximately 3,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Julia joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Julia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 5,000 PHP from HSPFI. This previous loan was used to  purchase additional products to sell. Julia is requesting a new loan of 8,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional inventory and as working capital. This will be the 7th loan taken out by Julia from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to supplement the income of the family. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is an accredited partner of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and reaches out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

For several years she has had a general store. Before having this store she did not have anywhere to buy food because she lived very far from the market.

She is very well known in town where the crafts fairs and feast days of San Luis Beltr\u00e1n are the busiest days with highest demand for all types of business.\n\nBecause Glenis also knows how to sew clothes she started out precisely doing this but gradually added miscellaneous items to sell together with her clothing items.  This is a business with a very specific market that is enriched by the miscellany.\n\nHer $1.500.000 COP Kiva loan is her second with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  Her prior loan allowed her to increase her income because she tells us that new capital to work results in profits for her.\n\nHer greatest challenge is her business\u2019 security and that is what she\u2019s working on to feel more relaxed because she's located just at the outskirts of town.\n\nShe will use these funds to buy stock items for her store during the month of love and friendship so that she can be prepared for the year\u2019s second semester, a very good time for commerce, when customers increase and there is better flow of money.  She will take advantage of this resource to also make some adjustments to her home to provide it with better security for the end of the year.\n\n\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Michael

At this time, she is working hard to be able to send all her children all the way through college -- a dream for most Filipino parents like Roselyn as she herself has been a college undergraduate and believes that a college diploma is the best inheritance parents could leave to their children.\r\n\r\nRoselyn operates a variety store. In the Philippines, a variety store is basically a small convenience store that retails groceries, toiletries and beverages piecemeal to the local neighborhood. It is the place to go to buy one sachet of shampoo, a 5-pesos worth of cooking oil or an egg. Juanita earns by getting supplies at a  wholesale price and selling them at a piece rate. Roselyn\u2019s store is located adjacent to her house. Her regular customers are her neighbors and the local community.  She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine pesos (Php) in sales every day.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue operations of her business, she is requesting a Php12,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nRoselyn dreams to be able to give all her children a good and high-quality education through all her hard work on her business. She also hopes to have her own house and lot someday. She faithfully meets up with her fellowship co-members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital and pay microfinance loans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":589474,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Buy more quantities of products like groceries, toiletries and beverages to expand her product inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Caloocan City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-08-25T21:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":275,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Roselyn ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-17T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":275,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-10-19T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-11-09T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.34},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":18.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":36.67,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T09:56:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1660.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166821772},{"amount":73.33,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:53:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3321.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172089016},{"amount":73.33,"local_amount":3200,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:21:04Z","rounded_local_amount":3321.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380382},{"amount":91.67,"local_amount":4000,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:22Z","rounded_local_amount":4152.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816720}],"funded_date":"2010-08-25T22:03:33Z","paid_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Michelle Archer","image":162079}},{"id":229859,"name":"Carla Vanessa","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Carla Vanessa,  tiene 22 a\u00f1os, ella es casada  y tiene un hijo de 1 a\u00f1o de edad.

It is a group of optimistic women who are fighters. This group was formed four years ago with 9 members who are exemplary. The trust between them exists not only because they are in the group together, but because they are also neighbors and live in the Catalina Huanca area, and that is where the group's name comes from.  \r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to comment on each member, but there aren't enough words. Therefore, we'll mention Mrs.Giuliana S\u00e1nchez, a 40 year old member who is a wife and mother of 3 children. She starts her daily work selling natural products. This has given her a lot of economic benefit for more than 3 years. She has been able to save for household expenses and her children's high school educations. With this loan, she will invest in business improvements and the outfitting of the same. Catalina Huanca is a group of women with care and dedication who know how to get ahead every day.

Juan has been farming for 55 years.  He learned this activity from his father when he was just 12 years old which kept him from going to school.\n\nJuan states that his prime objective is securing his family\u2019s food needs.  He has shown himself to be a very responsible person.  It\u2019s been 8 years now since he became a widower and was left in charge of providing education and nourishment for his two children.  Today, it\u2019s his two children that help him farm the land.\n\nDespite never having gone to school, Juan is a visionary man who struggles from sunup to sunup to be able to buy a piece of land to farm with his children in the future.  He has much faith that he\u2019ll accomplish this since his children share the same wish.\n\nJuan is asking Fundaci\u00f3n Campo for a loan to buy fertilizer and pesticides to be able to control infestations and crop diseases in his corn and bean plants that he planted during the last week in August.  With the loan, he\u2019ll be able to buy supplies at a better price and pay transportation costs just once to take them to his community.  Juan must travel almost two kilometers from his community to the place where he buys the supplies and then an additional two kilometers to the place where he does his planting.\n\nWith the sale of his harvest he plans to repay the loan granted by the Fundaci\u00f3n and also to buy some pigs to fatten up and have another source of income during the dry season.  He plans to save the remainder in order to be able to buy the land he currently farms.  Juan wants to be able to leave his children an estate that will make them proud of their father.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":871676,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farm Supplies","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy fertilizer and pesticide.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":"Anamoros","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":199,"posted_date":"2011-09-19T17:30:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Juan","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-03-13T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":500}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":500,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:46Z","rounded_local_amount":500,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263317635}],"funded_date":"2011-09-22T02:02:56Z","paid_date":"2012-03-15T09:28:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":340524,"name":"Babylin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Babylin is 38 years old and lives in the Philippines.

She is married and has three sons. Her husband is a Palestinian National Authority employee with a decent salary. Manal wants to purchase new home furniture such as living room seats and wants to make some repairs to her house by changing the windows. She hasn't enough money to pay for these expenses, so she needs to take a loan from FATEN. When Manal gets the loan, she will be able to purchase new home furniture and to pay for changing her home windows. This will make her live with her family in better living conditions. Manal is a conservative woman, so her husband Ramzi is photographed instead in the FATEN branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this loan product:\r\n FATEN offers loan products that are designed to serve borrowers all over Palestine, including some religiously conservative areas. A key tenet of Islam is the prohibition of interest in the lending or accepting of money. This prohibition is based on the belief that money should be seen only as a medium of exchange and that it has no value in itself. FATEN has adapted the terms of this loan to fit the cultural context by attaching a 0% interest rate to the loan. In order to cover its costs, FATEN does charge a servicing fee. The amount you see fundraising includes both the principal loan and the loan servicing fees. As with all Kiva loans, you should expect to have your funds returned to you in accordance with the repayment schedule attached to this loan.

As with most families in her neighborhood, her husband has a hard time finding consistent work in the off-season for sugar cane, and so Francisca works hard to make up the difference. She is requesting this loan to purchase chickens to prepare and sell in her community.\r\n<p>\r\nFrancisca is very involved with the local Club de Madres, or Mothers' Club, and her Catholic church.

She sells plates, cups, glasses and other disposable goods at very good prices. This has given her more costumers than other stores in the area. Work is very important for Jessica, because she knows that through it she has been able to provide her family with the necessary resources. She has been working at the store for a year and enjoys selling and being able to persuade the costumers who come into the store to buy something. The least favorite part of her work is to stay at the store all day without being able to go anywhere. She would like to enlarge her business and knows that this will require hard work. \r\n<p>\r\nThis is Jessica\u2019s first loan with MFP. She is committed to pay it on time as not to cause problems to the other members of the communal bank where she is appreciated. Jessica plans to use the nine hundred nuevos to buy more disposable goods to better supply her store.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Elsa  Mejia Connelly, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":313075,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Plastics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to increase the amount of merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-05-09T12:50:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Jesica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T00:54:06Z","rounded_local_amount":152.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44596185},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-06-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:11Z","rounded_local_amount":152.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52990463},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:38:43Z","rounded_local_amount":152.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63211574},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":152.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641087},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:29:12Z","rounded_local_amount":152.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73641088},{"amount":50,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:53Z","rounded_local_amount":152.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87080536}],"funded_date":"2009-05-09T16:39:42Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:53Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Elsa Mejia Connelly","image":null}},{"id":110208,"name":"Nestor","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"\"I work on a 1-hectare farm.

He has operated this business for more than 21 years, so this is not the first time that he has taken out a loan. He feels very motivated to continue working, since the loans have allowed him to keep his business active. He works in his home using simple tools, and his two younger sons, who are still in his care, help him as best they can with the business, which makes Reynaldo feel very proud.

She owns a business selling lava-lavas (bottom-half wrap-around prints worn by both men and women).  Tia has many years of experience in this business.  Tia needs a loan of WST $1,500 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 450 talas or US $188 per week) to improve\/expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Tia joined SPBD.  This is her second loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Tia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nAbout  SPBD:\r\n \r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.  SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.

Many years of experience, from a very early age on, and  hard daily work have allowed him to   become a successful farmer.\r\n\r\nHaving launched his business by planting potato seeds for the total sum of about 2,000 KGS, Nurlan has been able to develop a farm with a monthly income of 15,000 KGS. Today he has three horses and 10 sheep, as well as 1 ha [2.5 acres] of workable land, where he  grows potatoes as well as plants used for animal feed.\r\n\r\nIn order to develop his business further, Nurlan turned to \u201cBai Tushum and Partners\u201d for a loan in the amount of 100,000 KGS to buy sheep.

They all live in the city of San Antonio. \n\nAdela is the president of the community bank and in the picture she is sitting down in front of the group. She is wearing glasses, a white scarf, a black jacket and black trousers. She has been making and repairing clothes for 30 years. She works from home, where she has two sewing machines - one for straight stitches and an overlock one. She makes working clothes for fishermen, aprons and sleeves, as well as repairs on demand all year long. She buys her materials in the city of Santiago. Before she used to make ceviche and seafood soup, but her business was shut down because she didn't have purpose-built premises. In order to continue with the business she has to have spacious premises, even if that means occupying the kitchen in her home, to ensure high levels of hygiene. \n\nWith the loan she will buy pots, containers, bags and cans of lemon juice to prepare seafood dishes. Her goals are to expand her two businesses, the sewing business and in the future to have stable premises for her seafood selling business. \n\nAdela lives with her husband, her two daughters aged 29 and 24 and two grandchildren. Her dream is to generate more income to provide her family with a better quality of life. She is very happy and grateful for the services received from Fondo Esperanza. She is also very pleased with Grupo Adela, because the meetings are  fun and the group is committed, trustworthy and enthusiastic about the training. San Antonio is a port in the Valparaiso region, located in the central coast of Chile. The main industries are fishing and trading in fish and seafood. In spite of the commercial and shipping activity there is a high rate of unemployment at the port.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2825,"image":{"id":871561,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy pots, containers, bags and cans of lemon juice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"San Antonio","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-09-20T17:00:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2825,"lender_count":85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Adela ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristian","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lorena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"M\u00f3nica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Angelica","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Susana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angela","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Anali","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Loreto","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jeannette","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cecilia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Flora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-08-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1332660,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2825,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":89414},{"due_date":"2011-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":90269},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":91124},{"due_date":"2011-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":91998},{"due_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":92872},{"due_date":"2011-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":93765},{"due_date":"2011-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":94658},{"due_date":"2011-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":95570},{"due_date":"2011-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":96482},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":97394},{"due_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":98325},{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":99275},{"due_date":"2011-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":100225},{"due_date":"2011-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":101289}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.54},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.36},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.16},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":195.02},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.87},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":198.77},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":200.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":202.59},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":204.52},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":206.46},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":208.43},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":210.45},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.46},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":214.71}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":965.95,"local_amount":455677,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:00:18Z","rounded_local_amount":459069.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232796007},{"amount":806.54,"local_amount":380475,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:11:45Z","rounded_local_amount":383307.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238606928},{"amount":837.8,"local_amount":395219,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:50:30Z","rounded_local_amount":398161.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244561296},{"amount":214.71,"local_amount":101289,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:00:41Z","rounded_local_amount":102043.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250772291}],"funded_date":"2011-09-20T23:23:48Z","paid_date":"2012-01-15T10:00:41Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Alba Sort","image":550650}},{"id":340540,"name":"Erlinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Erlinda is now 53 years of age and lives with her five children.

He has been selling seafood for seven years. He distributes to all of the eastern region; fish and shrimp, mostly to restaurants. He gets up every day early in the morning, to get to the beaches and buy fresh seafood at wholesale. Then he visits the restaurants that have previously put in orders for him to deliver his product. \r\n\r\nHe gets around in his vehicle that he bought from the proceeds of his seafood sales. He has been gradually paying it off with a lot of effort, being responsible and on time with his payments. He himself comments that this makes him feel very proud; because he understands the importance of having an excellent record with his loans.  \r\n\r\nMario needs his loan in order to have working capital and to buy the product he sells; but in large quantities so that he can sell it by the pound. This way he earns profits that help him support his wife and children from day to day.  He is extremely well-known in the area, and has a lot of friends who buy seafood from him. \r\n\r\nOne of his fundamental aims in life is to provide his children with a good education, and that way make sure that they can get by in the future, and have the opportunity to improve themselves;

They are blessed with two children: Mark Edison, 9, is in grade 4 in primary level, and Mark Joseph, 5, is in the nursery level. According to Ma. Magdalena, the expenses for the schooling of their two children is not much right now. However, she wants to save early for their future needs in school. Hence she is pursuing her sewing business, which is their main source of income. She has been running this business for two years with help from her husband, who is also a sewer. With both of them working, they hope to increase their income.\r\n\r\nWhen she joined the Kiva field partner Ahon sa Hirap Inc. (ASHI), she used the loan as additional capital for her business; now she will do the same. She plans to use the loan to buy one sewing machine, which is a five threads machine.

She owns a business venture selling baked goods in the local community and has one year of experience in this business.\r\n\r\nSootaga needs a loan of WST 1,000 to buy raw ingredients to make more cooked foods. She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 250 talas or approximately US$93 per week) to improve and expand her business.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Sootaga joined SPBD and this is her first loan. SPBD's loans are Sootaga's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>About SPBD:<\/b>\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and, since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults. The official name of this borrowing group is Lydia B.'s Group.\r\n\r\nTo make a living, Norma owns and operates a general store, selling a variety of different products in the local community. She has been engaged in this business for ten years and earns approximately $50 a month. \r\n\r\nIn 2011, she joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. She is requesting a loan of 3,000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products for her retail store. This will be her 1st loan from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family.\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC: \r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao. It reaches out to the rural poor using the Grameen model. \r\n\r\n*Note:\r\nTo maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

She has a gas stove, firewood, serving trays, and metal pots.  Her workday is flexible and the summer season is when her foods are in highet demand because of the local festivities and fairs.  She buys ingredients at the supermarkets where prices are lower.  With the loan she will buy gas, potatoes, flour and a dough stretching machine.\r\n\r\nHer goals are to expand her business and build a stand where her customers can enjoy the food directly.  Nilda makes lard out of pork that she butchers locally and mixes with other foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nNilda lives with her husband and her two children, ages 19 and 17, who help her market her food and attract customers.  One of her dreams is to see her children finish their education so they can get a better job.  She also wants to travel around the country and visit different locations.\r\n\r\nShe is very happy and grateful for the services she receives through the Fondo Esperanza, since this allows her to have the necessary capital to invest in her business.  She also enjoys the cheerfulness and affection at the meetings at the communal bank, since the group is very united and supportive.\r\n\r\nCastro is the capital of the island of Chilo\u00e9 (the largest in South America), in the region of Los Lagos, in Chile's austral south area.  Its natural landscape is almost totally preserved from human intervention.  It also has a richly mythical, traditional culture.  One of the great attractions are the houses called Palafitos which are built on wooden stilts out over the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2800,"image":{"id":820092,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy gas, potatoes, flour and a dough stretching machine.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CL","country":"Chile","town":"Castro","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-30 -71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":157,"posted_date":"2011-07-25T16:30:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2800,"lender_count":103,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Nilda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Rebeca","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jose","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Debora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ninfa","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Marcia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karin","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Tania","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Cristina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Karla","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Betzabe","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Mariana","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yanara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Doris","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Manuel","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"CLP","disbursal_amount":1292580,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":2800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":88365},{"due_date":"2011-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":87443},{"due_date":"2011-07-20T07:00:00Z","amount":88276},{"due_date":"2011-07-27T07:00:00Z","amount":89120},{"due_date":"2011-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":89970},{"due_date":"2011-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":90833},{"due_date":"2011-08-17T07:00:00Z","amount":91700},{"due_date":"2011-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":92569},{"due_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","amount":93455},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":94352},{"due_date":"2011-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":95255},{"due_date":"2011-09-21T07:00:00Z","amount":96162},{"due_date":"2011-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":97080},{"due_date":"2011-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":98000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.42},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":189.42},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":191.22},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":193.05},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.9},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":196.76},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":198.64},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.53},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":202.44},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":204.39},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":206.34},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":208.31},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":210.29},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":212.29}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":765.11,"local_amount":353204,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:45:15Z","rounded_local_amount":353943.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221666449},{"amount":993.27,"local_amount":458527,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-15T09:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":459486.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227035306},{"amount":619.04,"local_amount":285769,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:00:22Z","rounded_local_amount":286366.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232795963},{"amount":422.58,"local_amount":195080,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T10:11:27Z","rounded_local_amount":195488.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238606884}],"funded_date":"2011-07-29T02:10:19Z","paid_date":"2011-11-15T10:11:27Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sherry Bess","image":833485}},{"id":324148,"name":"Jane","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Jane is 38 years old and married to Evans.

Su horario de atenci\u00f3n es de 7:00 am a 7:00 pm, y cuando sus hijos regresan de clases le ayudan a atender la pulperia.

Her husband is in charge of working their land.  Their home is located in the community of Las Am\u00e9ricas in the town of Patuca.  Do\u00f1a Santos started earning her livelihood by selling tamales.  Sometime later she bought a bag of donuts and came up with the idea of starting a new business.  She used her earnings to begin placing bags of donuts on the front wall of her home so that children passing by on their way to school could buy them.  Santos later thought about selling groceries and set aside a small space in her house for installing a few shelves so that she could begin selling all types of products.  She was not able to buy many products since she did not have sufficient capital, but now that she has access to loans from FAMA, Santos is able to gradually stock her store.  Her schedule of operation is from 7am to 7pm.  When her children come home from school, they help with managing the store.  The greatest challenge that Do\u00f1a Santos faces is the location of her home, which is some distance from the main road that leads to town.  This makes it difficult to have products delivered and the cost of transportation is expensive.  For this reason, her goals are to acquire a small pick-up truck and to help her children finish their studies.  \r\n<p>\r\nDo\u00f1a Santos is requesting a loan to buy products such as rice, sugar, lard, laundry detergent, dish soap, soft drinks, beans, coffee, bread, donuts, candy, juices, and other products.

International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

joining the TYM Fund, Mrs. U. faced a lot of difficulties in doing business because her husband passed away and her 2 children were still going to school. In 2003, she joined the TYM Fund to borrow money. At first, she invested in raising chickens. However, later on, she realized that growing decorative plants brought more profits. Therefore, she decided to invest in growing plants. Because she has learned lots of experience from other people, she has a lot of customers. Currently, her 2 children are all grown-up. She and her children work on growing the plants to meet local people\u2019s needs. With an earning of 200 USD\/month, their living conditions have improved. This time, she wants to borrow 1100 USD to invest in both raising animals and growing decorative plants. \r\n<b><p>Translated from Vietnamese by Duy Hua, Kiva volunteer.<\/p><\/b>\r\n\r\n\r\nTr\u01b0\u1edbc khi tham gia Qu\u1ef9 t\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng gia \u0111\u00ecnh ch\u1ecb U\u1ea9n g\u1eb7ph r\u1ea5t nhi\u1ec1u kh\u00f3 kh\u0103n v\u1ec1 kinh t\u1ebf do ch\u1ed3ng ch\u1ecb m\u1ea5t s\u1ee1n, c\u00e1c con \u0111ang tu\u1ed5i \u0111\u1ebfn tr\u01b0\u1eddng.N\u0103m  2003 ch\u1ecb b\u1eaft \u0111\u1ea7u tham gia v\u00e0o Qu\u1ef9 t\u00ecnh th\u01b0\u01a1ng \u0111\u1ec3 vay v\u1ed1n ph\u00e1t tri\u1ec3n kinh t\u1ebf gia \u0111\u00ecnh. .

She will use this loan to buy a greater quantity of products, including nativity scenes which are very popular during the Christmas season.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Laure Kwon, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":247318,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To increase the stock of her store","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-12-27T02:00:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-12T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","amount":175}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.38},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.34}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2009-01-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:04:55Z","rounded_local_amount":183.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10228259},{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T20:04:23Z","rounded_local_amount":183.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20423491},{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2009-03-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:35:51Z","rounded_local_amount":183.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27116753},{"amount":59.37,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2009-04-13T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:45:36Z","rounded_local_amount":183.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011684},{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:00:59Z","rounded_local_amount":183.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595293},{"amount":59.38,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:39:36Z","rounded_local_amount":183.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989509},{"amount":59.39,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:41:41Z","rounded_local_amount":183.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210727},{"amount":59.34,"local_amount":175,"processed_date":"2009-08-10T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:22Z","rounded_local_amount":183.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640352}],"funded_date":"2008-12-27T04:34:12Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:20:22Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"L K","image":355766}},{"id":85664,"name":"Rosalie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalie S. is a 29-year-old married woman with 3 children.

Her family is actively helping her with her business, which she started about 4 years ago.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

He has always had an inclination for driving cars, since he was fascinated by them as a kid.  Walter says he began working as a public bus driver and later as a chauffeur of a rented car.  He takes pleasure in all of his jobs because they have provided a distraction from reality and he gets to travel to different parts of the city.\r\n<p>\r\nWalter begins his day in the early morning hours and returns home tired very late at night.  He has encountered problems with passengers who refuse to pay their cab fare.  Fortunately, he loves his job and wants to continue succeeding through his hard work.

The hamlet is located in mountainous terrain and is very close to the northern border of Costa Rica.  The area\u2019s principal economic activities are farming and agriculture of which staple grains, sugar cane, and oranges constitute the main crops.  Eight months ago, Freddy secured a job at a pineapple plantation.  However, the plantation is located at some considerable distance from his home and Freddy finds it difficult to get to work due to the poor state of local roads and public transportation.  Due to the time spent travelling to and from work, Freddy has been unable to tend to the allotment he owns.  Therefore, Freddy has decided to buy a moped to solve his transportation problems and to save on money and time.  He is asking for a loan of \u00a2654 (six hundred and fifty four Costa Rican Colons) to buy the moped and, thus, equip him with his own form of transport.  Freddy forms part of the Community Lending facility Emcrecoba, one of 100 affiliated organisations of EDESA in Costa Rica.  This is his first loan and Freddy expresses thanks for the opportunity to focus on productive activities that such organisations and loan facilitators provide him.           \r\n<br

She sells food from a \"salchipapera\" cart (especially fried foods), and with it she goes out to work in an area close to her home.  Her sales are good, thanks to her tasty dishes, which are the delight of her guests.  She offers fast food such as salchipapas (sausages and fried potatoes), fried chicken wings, and others.  She has attracted various customers, not only because of the exquisite dishes, but also because of her charm and unassuming nature.  In the mornings she works alongside her sister selling condiments, which gives her additional income.  She prefers to work all day.  In the future she wants to continue to work; she wants to set up a place of her own where she can offer her dishes in greater comfort.  This is her 2nd loan with MFP, and she promises to be very punctual with all of her payments, because she wants to get ahead.  She is planning on investing the money requested in the bulk purchase of the ingredients she needs to continue making her delicious dishes.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Lisa Grobar, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":557976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy supplies for her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:34Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bernalda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":300,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-11-15T08:00:00Z","amount":50},{"due_date":"2010-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":50}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:49Z","rounded_local_amount":58.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159673473},{"amount":32.92,"local_amount":79.01,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:25:57Z","rounded_local_amount":93.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172154303},{"amount":29.58,"local_amount":70.99,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T15:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":83.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177449601},{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:01:39Z","rounded_local_amount":58.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182588302},{"amount":20.83,"local_amount":50,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:58Z","rounded_local_amount":58.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188724805}],"funded_date":"2010-07-01T07:21:29Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Lisa Grobar","image":264298}},{"id":213519,"name":"Irma Deisy","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La sra.

The most difficult part is dealing with the insects which infect the new shoots.\r\n\r\nWith the loan money Miryan plans to buy cocoa and coffee seeds, but her first priority is to buy more land so she can grow more crops. This is her first loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she knows that she must be punctual with the repayments if she wishes to get another loan in the future. She is very happy to be a member of her community bank and will contribute to its development. With the 1,000 soles Miryan will buy cocoa and coffee seeds.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":753267,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to buy cocoa and coffee seeds","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-04-19T15:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":375,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Miryan ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":185.24},{"due_date":"2011-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":191.48},{"due_date":"2011-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":200.18},{"due_date":"2011-08-08T07:00:00Z","amount":206.98},{"due_date":"2011-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":216.12}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":69.47},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":71.8},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.07},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":77.62},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":69.47,"local_amount":185.24,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:41:36Z","rounded_local_amount":195.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211270229},{"amount":71.8,"local_amount":191.48,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:32:33Z","rounded_local_amount":202.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216550248},{"amount":75.07,"local_amount":200.18,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T09:13:33Z","rounded_local_amount":211.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221718923},{"amount":77.62,"local_amount":206.98,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:14:16Z","rounded_local_amount":218.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227350391},{"amount":81.04,"local_amount":216.12,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:18Z","rounded_local_amount":228.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232850891}],"funded_date":"2011-04-19T20:03:20Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:49:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jane A"}},{"id":295475,"name":"Susan","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Susan is 42 years old and married with six children.

Everything they make is based on orders from their customers.  Her husband is a woodworker and works every day to produce the furniture.  This business previously belonged to a relative and they took over six years ago.  Their work is driven by orders and their products are sold for cash.  To generate extra income, Blanca makes and sells bread every day.  \r\n<p>\r\nBlanca has received eight loans to invest in the purchase of wood and supplies for making furniture.  Part of the money was used to buy supplies for making bread.

Sherbek is from the Shahrituz district, where he works in livestock and agriculture by raising cattle and planting vegetables. Later he reaps the benefits of this, thereby surviving with his family, which includes his wife and five children. It should be mentioned that this young man is a hard worker and has now redoubled his efforts because he wants to have better income to fulfill the needs of his family. Therefore, Sherbek has asked for the support of Kiva partner IMON International and a loan that will allow him to buy materials for planting his crops as well as to invest in purchasing and raising cattle in his area.\r\n<p> \r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n<p> \r\nTajikistan is perhaps best known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road; the end of Alexander the Great's rule; and its famous great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n<p> \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war that ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R. further damaged its already weak economy. 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable--conditions that have resulted in high levels of unemployment and forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n<p> \r\nIMON's History\r\n<p> \r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
