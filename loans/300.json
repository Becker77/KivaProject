Dana pinjaman tersebut dipakai untuk mengembangkan usaha Warung makannya. Untuk menjalan usaha ini, Girah harus berjualan selama 24 jam nonstop,sebab warung terletak di daerah dermaga yang setiap saat ada nelayan yang berlabuh untuk beristirahat. Dengan setia Asbullah, suaminya, tetap menemani Girah di warungnya siang dan malam karena anak-anaknya sudah semua menikah. Semua kegiatan untuk menjalan usaha, baik memasak dan istirahat, dapat dilakukan diwarungnya. Dengan keuletan inilah Girah dapat memperbaiki warung sehingga layak untuk ditempati."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":187788,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Needs working capital to better equip the stall","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ID","country":"Indonesia","town":"Melaya, Bali","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-5 120","type":"point"}},"partner_id":82,"posted_date":"2008-08-08T09:10:19Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":125,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Girah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-08-22T10:43:03Z","disbursal_currency":"IDR","disbursal_amount":1000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":125,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-09-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":200000},{"due_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","amount":200000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":25},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":25}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-09-22T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-29T07:22:36Z","rounded_local_amount":228192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":334322},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-10-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-11-16T08:42:03Z","rounded_local_amount":228192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":368756},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-11-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-19T08:05:16Z","rounded_local_amount":228192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5308521},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-22T08:55:55Z","rounded_local_amount":228192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9925447},{"amount":25,"local_amount":200000,"processed_date":"2009-01-22T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-08T09:05:18Z","rounded_local_amount":228192.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14849744}],"funded_date":"2008-08-08T10:43:03Z","paid_date":"2009-03-08T09:05:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":63220,"name":"Alfonso Vicente","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"Alfonso is 38, lives with his wife and three children.

She lives with her godmother, and works hard to improve her current economic situation.  She has been working for 3 years, selling clothing on weekends at the Laguna Temporal Esplanade (the location where the markets of the city of Juliaca take place).  She enjoys selling clothes, and especially helping out people who are looking for something new, eye-catching, and of good quality.  Beatriz wants her business to prosper and grow a great deal.  The most difficult part for her is acquiring the garments, given she only buys the best because she has a reputation to uphold that helps her make more sales.  Beatriz is in her second loan with MFP, and is one of the youngest members of her cooperative bank.  For this reason, she gets support from all the other members so that her business goes well.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

What she likes best about selling fruit is that her daughters are at home with her.

She will use the money from the loan to invest it well, buying more fruit to sell wholesale.  Above all, she wants to buy grapes because of the demand there is for this product at the end of the year.

She owns a business venture, selling wood handicrafts to tourists and local community members.  Malia has many years of experience in this business.  Malia needs a loan of WST $1750 to purchase additional handicrafts to sell.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 500 talas or US $208 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nYou can view pictures\/video of fine mat weaving, taken by a Kiva Fellow, at:   http:\/\/picasaweb.google.com\/agnes.p.chu\/WeavingFineMats#\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Malia joined SPBD.    This is her 4th loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Malia's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Malia M. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.65 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.5 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.5 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is married to Edwin C., a waiter, and they are blessed with five children. She makes sure that she helps her husband earn so that their family can have a better life.  She has been managing her wooden furniture shop for quite some time now.\r\n\r\nGerlie has been a regular member of Center for Community Transformation* (CCT) for more than a year now. She regularly attends their weekly fellowship meetings and pays her weekly dues consistently. Because of her good repayment performance with her previous loans, she was able to borrow quite a few times in CCT\u2019s Cooperative.  She is consistent in paying her dues because she used the money she borrowed to expand and improve her furniture business.     \r\n\r\nTo ensure the success of her business, she would like to apply for a PHP 16,000 loan. This amount will be used as a source of added capital to her expanding business by buying raw materials needed to continue production of her furniture.\r\n\r\nShe dreams that her business will continue to grow so that she can provide for her children\u2019s education. She also wants to live out her years with her family in peace.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":375,"image":{"id":511081,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Furniture

Patan BPW became Kiva's first field partner in Nepal in 2007. It operates throughout the Kathmandu Valley, offering microcredit and business training programs to low-income women. In addition to providing economic opportunity to its clients, Patan BPW seeks to empower Nepali women within the home and community.\r\n\r\nWith a Kiva loan, Patan BPW's borrowers are able to purchase greater amounts of seed and fertilizer, which enables them to grow cash crops to sell in the local market. Such crops allow households to move beyond subsistence and provide much-needed cash income throughout the year.\r\n\r\nFor more information about Patan BPW, visit our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/partners\/62\" target=\"_blank\">Patan BPW partner page<\/a> to keep an eye out for new loans and borrower updates.

She lives in Sitio Mahayahay, Brgy. Daan Lungsod, Medellin, Cebu. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2005 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fishing business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 12500. \r\n\r\nCelsa is now borrowing PHP 20000 so that she can fund her business operations. This will be her ninth loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey towards economic freedom. Celsa aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well being by following the Dungganon way.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means \"honorable\"). Through the program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

SELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through micro-leasing whereby SELFINA buys and leases equipment to women. Specifically, when a client needs working capital, SELFINA will purchase equipment from said client, extend a loan to her, and then lease the same equipment back to her \u2013 a process called a sale and leaseback arrangement. Customs and traditions in Tanzania normally make it difficult for women to own land and assets; therefore, financial institutions do not consider Tanzanian women to be credit-worthy because they lack tangible assets that could serve as collateral. As a result, Tanzanian women with low income receive poor financial support and meager access to basic needs and services. SELFINA thanks you for your

All are very excited and happy to start their own businesses so that they can support their families. They all have large families and need to help their spouses with the household costs, especially since the majority of them have children who are old enough for school, but they do not have the money to give them a proper education. <p>\r\nThere are several types of businesses within the group. For example, Don Carlitos has a public taxi service. Also, members sell clothing, condiments, produce, and cosmetics. They sell these goods retail, and have to purchase them wholesale in order to sell them as street vendors. \r\n<p>The entire group needs a larger loan to be able to get the products wholesale and, thus, expand their businesses and increase their profits.

He is the father of two young children and has been married for approximately ten years.  Efra\u00edn has always seen to the well being of his family.\r\n\r\nMore than fifteen years ago Efra\u00edn and his sister took a course on textile manufacturing thanks to a state program called PROJOVEN.  Using their knowledge of clothes manufacturing, Efra\u00edn and his sister operate a small textile business.  For four years they have produced clothes to sell in different markets, specializing in winter clothing.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, Efra\u00edn works as a contractor for civil construction projects, managing a group of people who work under him.  At the same time, in order to get ahead, he started taking classes at a university one year ago and is studying to be a civil engineer.  He conducts his studies at night, in the little free time he has.

Having lacked the chance to advance in school due to societal reasons, she got started in the business of dyed damask fabrics and their sales.  She learned how to do this from a friend over ten years ago.  She is in high demand by her customers, who are composed essentially of women, for the quality of her products.  \r\n<p>\r\nGiven the location of her shop, found along one of the main arteries of the city of Sikasso, she receives many customers.  She also ships her dyed damask to Abidjan (capital of the Cote d\u2019Ivoire) by special order.  \r\n<p>\r\nWanting to do better in satisfying her burgeoning customer base, she decided to join the loan program of the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso and is now on her first individual loan.   \r\n<p>\r\nWith this loan, she plans to buy eight bolts of white damask, ten containers of dye of different colors, ten packets of caustic soda, ten cloth suits for men, five bolts of light-weight cloth, ten containers of ointment, etc.  She supplies herself in Bamako and then resells the goods in her shop, not far from the Sikasso bus station.  \r\n<p>\r\nShe envisions realizing a monthly profit of 100,000 francs CFA that will be used essentially to augment her working capital, to help cover family expenses, to make loan interest payments, and to invest the rest in her business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva

As his salary is not enough to feed his family, he also runs a retail business making furniture. \r\n<p>\r\nIn 2007, Erdenebat started renting a room to run his furniture-making business. He makes a variety of wooden furniture for gers, such as chairs, tables and beds. Ger furniture is a bit smaller than house furniture. Most of his customers are local residents who live in the ger district. Erdenebat purchases planks at wholesale prices and dries them for 15 to 30 days, depending on how sunny it is.

She plans to use the earnings from her business o improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Koreti joined SPBD.  This is her 3rd loan with SPBD. SPBD's loans are Koreti's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Koreti F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.87 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

With respect to the businesses which the rest of the organization's members carry out, they are varied and include: guest house, hand-made wool pictures, making braided rugs, embroideries, dressmaking, cosmetics sales, buying and selling of silver and gold, and grocery sales.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":2325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":2325,"image":{"id":631255,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of supplies, rice, noodles and oil","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2010-10-31T22:30:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":2325,"lender_count":75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Virginia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Yola","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Candelaria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Judith Milenka","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ivan Gonzalo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Roxana Jimena","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martha Benita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abigail Lidia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-10-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":16161.6,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":2325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1616.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":1616.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1616.16},{"due_date":"2010-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1616.16},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":1616.16},{"due_date":"2011-01-27T08:00:00Z","amount":1616.16},{"due_date":"2011-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1616.16},{"due_date":"2011-02-24T08:00:00Z","amount":1616.16},{"due_date":"2011-03-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1616.16},{"due_date":"2011-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":1616.16}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.5},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.5},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":232.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.5},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.5},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":232.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":232.5,"local_amount":1616.16,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T15:33:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1620.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182607992},{"amount":697.5,"local_amount":4848.48,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:35:24Z","rounded_local_amount":4861.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188747052},{"amount":465,"local_amount":3232.32,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T05:27:34Z","rounded_local_amount":3241.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191485233},{"amount":465,"local_amount":3232.32,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T12:16:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3241.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195912080},{"amount":465,"local_amount":3232.32,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-22T08:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":3241.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":202161042}],"funded_date":"2010-11-06T08:08:18Z","paid_date":"2011-04-22T08:14:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":248473,"name":"Edilberta","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Edilberta B. is a married woman who lives in Barangay Lagunde, Oslob, Cebu.

They have 7 children who are 10 to 21 years old with one already working while the other 5 children are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nEdilberta joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2005 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 10 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Edilberta has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 8,000, thus uplifting the family's standard of living. This time, for her 11th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 which she intends to use to purchase more stock to sell so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. Edilberta B. is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path towards the achievement of her dreams.  \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

ventures:   pig fattening, livestock and basket weaving. She lives in Danao City, Cebu. Gregoria joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2009 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past three loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Gregoria has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 10,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 13,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her fourth loan, she is borrowing PHP 12,000 to buy medicines and vaccines for her pigs so that she can continue to save up for the future renovation of house. Gregoria is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

With her traveling papers in hand, she also brings with her merchandise such as clothing, sandals, silver jewelry, and other accessories to sell while she is there.  When she returns home, she brings back with her boxes of cheese, avocados, and even \u201c<i>diabolines<\/i>\u201d (delicious toasted cheese snacks that are made in Sucre and sold in the city of Soledad).  All of this activity in her life is a result of managing a store for twelve years.  She became accustomed to performing a great deal of work each day and now she cannot quit.  After her store closed down, she began selling soups from the doorstep of her house.    She also started bringing various types of merchandise to Corozal in the Department of Sucre to take advantage of the market owned by her relatives who live there.  Upon her return home, she brought back \u201c<i>diabolines<\/i>\u201d, cheese, and avocados to sell.

Her previous loan replaced other expensive loans, one with a monthly interest rate of 10%.  This new loan had a lower rate and more favorable terms.  At the moment, she is requesting her second loan from the organization in order to buy clothing, flour, cheese, \u201c<i>diabolines<\/i>\u201d, and oil.

He\u2019s 37 years old living alongside his wife and three children in his home.  He has always lived in his native land and since childhood his parents taught him all the essentials of farming as well as livestock raising.  However, he always knew the difficulties inherent in field work because of the weather conditions that can seriously affect profits from crops.  Because of this, he opted to insure income by setting up a small store in his house.  His store is one of two that exist in his community and every day he has regular sales that allow him to have stable income and more frequent profits compared to farming where he has to wait several months to enjoy the fruits of his labor.

She produces films and video recordings of special events such as weddings, graduations, birthdays, and other occasions.  Mar\u00eda conducts her business by traveling to different places near the neighborhood where she lives such as churches, elementary schools, high schools, universities, parks, businesses, and other sites.  She is a very creative woman, but above all she demonstrates a great deal of initiative.  For her, there are no obstacles that could hinder her when it is time to film.  Mar\u00eda has good personal references since there are many people from the area who express their trust and appreciation for her work, which is why her services are in demand.  \r\n<p>\r\nMar\u00eda decided to request a loan from Apoyo Integral in order to buy a new camera and film accessories, since these are the main pieces of equipment that she uses in her work.  She would not be able to function without them.  Mar\u00eda says that it is always good to be prepared and ready for any event because all of them are important.  She trusts God that she will be able to improve her quality of life and that of her family.  \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":866921,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Film","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"to purchase a video camera and film accessories.

Currently the group is in its 18th loan cycle and has been working with the Foundation since the year 2006. \r\n\r\nOne of the group's members is Ms. Alicia who is married with two children. She tells us she has a small grocery store in her home, and her husband earns a living selling natural gas, and they also provide rental services for children's events. They both help each other get the family ahead. Alicia comments that she is doing very well with her sales and so she is requesting the loan, so she may stock her business, giving it more variety in order to continue bringing in income. \r\n\r\nShe wishes to purchase grocery items, drinks, dairy products, bakery items and other things. She appreciates the foundation and Kiva for this opportunity for progress they are being given. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4800,"image":{"id":963327,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Grocery Store","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to purchase groceries, drinks, dairy products, bakery products and other items.

Their biggest source of income is the fruit of their labor; they grow pineapples and granadia fruit. She is proud of the quality of her crops and of her knowledge. While waiting for the best moment of production, she is requesting a loan in order to maintain her crops, holding off on the harvest until the market indicates that it is the best time to yield the biggest profits.

It is sunny in certain seasons in the mountains and in part of the irrigated and cultivated valley.  At this time he is planting potatoes.  There are times when his wife helps to take to pasture the cows, pigs, and the burrows.  They have to transport their harvest for some distance, when they have access to transportation.

Ikromjon is 30 years old. He is married with two children. Seven years ago he started his business selling cell phones. Ikromjon believes that this business is profitable and the generated income allows him to support his family. However, he thinks that it is expensive to purchase the cell phones locally and it will save him money if he purchases the goods in China. With this purpose, Ikromjon requests $800 US Dollars. Being loaned for the first time, Ikromjon is grateful to everyone supporting him and promises to repay the loan promptly.  \n\n\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\n\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

The money she is now requesting will be used to buy more sweaters to embroider.  Also, she will buy beauty products to resell at a higher price.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":484248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","themes":null,"use":"Buy more sweaters to embroider","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-02-08T00:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":139.28},{"due_date":"2010-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":156.53},{"due_date":"2010-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":164.88},{"due_date":"2010-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":171.47},{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":180.02},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":187.82}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.75},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.78},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.71},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.02},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.74}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":48.75,"local_amount":139.28,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:18Z","rounded_local_amount":139.42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128993185},{"amount":54.79,"local_amount":156.53,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:40:03Z","rounded_local_amount":156.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751646},{"amount":57.71,"local_amount":164.88,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:03:04Z","rounded_local_amount":165.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151934112},{"amount":60.01,"local_amount":171.47,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:37:05Z","rounded_local_amount":171.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672887},{"amount":63.01,"local_amount":180.02,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:56Z","rounded_local_amount":180.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886695},{"amount":43.53,"local_amount":124.36,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T14:03:57Z","rounded_local_amount":124.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188725528},{"amount":22.2,"local_amount":63.46,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":63.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463818}],"funded_date":"2010-02-08T04:33:20Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:39:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":178546,"name":"Ruth","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ruth M. is from the village of Yumbing Mambajao, Camiguin Province.

SPBD's loans are Gagae's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Gagae E. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              2 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         2 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures: the selling of chicken barbeque, a general store and a pig fattening business. Her husband, Nilo, who is 31 years old, works as a laborer to earn his living.  They have two children who are 8 and 12 years old. Ma. Louella joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she aspired to something better for her family. With the help of her past 15 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Ma. Louella has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 24,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 20,000, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 16th cycle loan, she is borrowing PHP 29,000, with which she intends to purchase additional stock for her business so that she can continue to save up for the education of her children and for home repairs. Ma. Louella is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

He is a very kind and hard-working man who lives in his own home together with his wife, 28 year-old Virginia, and his five beloved children who he would like to provide with a better quality of life.\r\n\r\nEvery morning, Guido takes a lot of care in working his land and making it fertile since he knows that the quality of his coffee plantations and avocado trees depends on it.  After harvesting his crops, Guido takes them to the market in the town of Pichanaki to sell.  What he most enjoys about his work is the fact that he has a lot of freedom to work on his land since he can make use of his own time and capital.  He has been in this business for 10 years and he considers the most difficult part of his work to be weeding his coffee plantations.\r\n\r\nOver time, Guido would like to buy more land so that he can increase his production.  This is his first loan with MFP and he feels capable of making all his loan repayments.  Guido is one of the most active members of his community bank and, for this reason, he is very well liked and respected.

He makes his living driving passengers around the Ukraine.  He's married with two children: an eleven-year-old son, and a one-year-old daughter.  He has no trouble getting business.  He has regular customers and an excellent reputation.  He's been in the business for twelve years and makes 5000 hryvni.  At present he uses his own car, a 2006 Opel Astra.  It's in great condition.\r\n\r\nVasil needs a loan of 10,000 hryvni to install a fourth generation fuel injection system so his car can run on LP gas, and also do some routine repairs. By converting his car to LP gas, he'll lower his fuel  expenses and increase profits. Vasil provides the primary means of transportation for his clients' families.  Earlier he worked for the police, but he left that and got into driving passengers, since there were no other options for supporting his family.

After moving to the US from his native Columbia, he worked for a company that builds and finishes all types of wood furniture, cabinets, floors, etc. Carlos fell in love with the job and decided to work for himself as a wood craftsman. He opened a carpentry business out of his home in Florida almost three years ago. Carlos is proud that he is able to support his family through his hard work while doing something he loves. He hopes this loan will enable him to expand by hiring employees, opening a store-front, and let him make a greater contribution to his community.\r\n\r\nThis loan from Accion USA will allow Carlos to build the credit history he needs in the United States in order to formalize his business. He then can take the necessary steps to move from his home to a store-front location. Carlos says this loan will help him to obtain the tools he needs to showcase his excellent work and access a greater number of clients.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":6450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":6450,"image":{"id":933644,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Carpentry","sector":"Construction","themes":null,"use":"To

Now, he goes around the streets of \"The Bride of the Sun\" on a  trike offering the delicious \"atole de coco (natural)\" (coconut atole- a maize-based beverage),  tamales, corn, buns and cakes; meanwhile she happily takes care of the customers in their small grocery, which they were able to open with the profit they earned. \n\nAs is now custom, every weekend Santa sets up two tables to exhibit a large variety of sweets, cakes, tacos and tamales.  They keep sodas and juices in a cooler, and in a liter container, they have horchata and hibiscus water, to spoil their customers.  \"The secret to success,\" they enthusiastically say, \"is in how we work and treat our customers.\"  Their work has allowed them to offer their family a better quality of life, primarily by giving their children an education.  \n\n\u201cFrom Monday to Friday I'm in the store.

He was orphaned very early on, when his father died.  To take over the responsibilities for his younger brothers, he started farming, especially sugar cane.  Today, he has 10 years worth of experience in this domain and has reached a production level that proves his mastery of the business.  He now plans on growing crops in the off-season to meet market demands in his area.  Previous loans allowed him to grow his operation and to improve his crop yields through the use of herbicides.  Presently, the procurement of selected cuttings and the purchase of a motorized irrigation pump are his concerns for which he is requesting a loan of $950.  He can then increase his production.

on July 12, 1974 in Naimey, Niger, Mrs. Afi O. is married to a tailor who is out of work and they have five children to raise. She left school to learn to be a seamstress. After she completed her apprenticeship, she also learned to dye lengths of African print cloth. Now, lacking the necessary funds, she is doing nothing. Her business amounts to selling penny candies and such, which does not bring in any real income. The fact that her husband is also not presently working as a tailor makes it extremely hard for them to support their family. In order to get back into business and manage to support their children, Mrs. O. is requesting a loan of US$ 1000. <P>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva volunteer<P><\/B>N\u00e9e le 12 juillet 1974 \u00e0 Niamey au Niger, madame Afi O. est mari\u00e9 \u00e0 un couturier sans travail avec cinq (05) enfants \u00e0 charge.

As a result, her business has taken a hit because her working capital is inadequate to purchase appreciable quantities to sell. Therefore, she is now seeking a loan to inject additional capital into her business to enable her meet the demands of the marketplace. Specifically, she wants to use the loan proceeds to increase her stock of rice and sugar and to thereby increase her profits. In turn, Gladys hopes to accumulate more savings in order to pay for her children's education fees. <p>\r\n\r\nShe is a member of the community group known as the Angel Trust Group. In this group, members guarantee each other's loans as social collateral (i.e., if one member does not promptly repay her portion of the loan, then the other members are responsible for curing the arrears), and they provide support for one another to repay their respective loans.

Thanh Hoa City is the provincial capital of Thanh Hoa province, one of the poorest provinces in\nVietnam. It is located approximately 150 kilometers south of Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam.\nMrs. Trinh Thi Hue is the lead borrower of the group.

The other borrowers in the group will use their share of the loan as follows:\n* Mrs. Trinh Thi Hue is borrowing 1,626,900 Vietnamese Dong (~ US$93) to buy kitchenware such as pots, pans, scissors, teapots, mops,thermos flasks, rice cookers, washing up liquid and chopsticks for her market stall.\n* Mrs. Ngoc is borrowing money to buy clothes for resale in Dong Thanh market.\n* Mrs. Lien is borrowing money to buy sugar, salt, towels, candies, biscuits, breads, etc. for resale in Dong Thanh market.\n* Mrs. Lam Thi Hue is borrowing money to buy bowls, dishes and spoons for resale in Dong Thanh market.\n* Mrs. Loi is borrowing money to buy blankets, pillows and sedge mats for resale in Dong Thanh market.\n* Mrs. Lanh is borrowing money to buy bread for resale on the street in the early morning.\n\n","en":"<br><i>Note: original loan description is in English.<\/i><br>\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Vietnamese by Khang Ho-Si, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":575,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":575,"image":{"id":255520,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy bowls, dishes, blankets, pillows, clothes...","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"VN","country":"Vietnam","town":"Thanh Ho\u00e1","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"16.166667 107.833333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":121,"posted_date":"2009-01-17T16:00:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":575,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hu\u1ec7","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ng\u1ecdc","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Li\u00ean","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hu\u1ec7","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"L\u1ee3i","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Lanh","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-01-10T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"VND","disbursal_amount":9761400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":575,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-05-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900},{"due_date":"2009-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":1626900}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.83},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":95.85}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T08:28:54Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20398716},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T18:20:24Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27090643},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T16:14:02Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":35984010},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T22:56:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44444663},{"amount":95.83,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T20:27:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52955275},{"amount":95.85,"local_amount":1626900,"processed_date":"2009-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:39:49Z","rounded_local_amount":1683600,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63172626}],"funded_date":"2009-01-17T17:22:00Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T13:39:49Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"khang hosi","image":124954}},{"id":87862,"name":"Clarisse","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Clarisse I.  in Gatsata Sector, Gasabo District, Kigali (capital of Rwanda)!

Culipapa, Hinoba-an, Negros Occidental. She earns her living by fishing and fish vending. Her husband, Romy, is a fisherman and Josephine sells his catch in their community and in the nearby public market. They have two children who are 12 and 13 years old and are currently going to school. \r\n\r\nJosephine joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in July, 2006, in the hope that she would be able to help her husband improve the quality of life for their family. With the help of her loans from NWTF-PD, she has been able to increase their income with her fishing and fish vending business. Now she earns an average monthly income of 10,000 Philippine pesos (PHP) from her business activities.\r\n\r\nJosephine is a member in good standing. Her previous loan of 25,000 PHP was used to fund the operations of her fishing and fish vending business, and it had a positive impact on both the business and the family\u2019s living conditions. Now she is applying for her 8th loan, for 25,000 PHP, which she intends to use to fund the operations of her fishing and fish vending business. Josephine is working hard to achieve her dreams and aspirations for her family, which are to provide them with a brighter future and a more comfortable life.\r\n\r\n<b>About NWTF:<\/b>\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project <i>Dungganon<\/i> (a Hiligaynon word that means <u>honorable<\/u>).

She owns a business venture, selling lavalavas (bottom-half wrap-around prints worn by both men and women).  Leipu has 2 years of experience in this business.  Leipu needs a loan of WST $1000 to purchase additional fabrics & materials.  She plans to use the earnings from her business (estimated to be 350 talas or US $146 per week) to improve\/expand the business.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Leipu joined SPBD.    This is her 2nd loan with SPBD.   SPBD's loans are Leipu's only access to capital because she was never able to qualify for a loan with traditional banks.\r\n\r\nThe following social metrics for Leipu F. are provided by SPBD*:\r\nOverall Social Metric Score:                1.6 out of 3\r\nLevel of Education:                              1.5 out of 3\r\nLevel of total Household Income:         1.7 out of 3\r\nQuality of Household Assets:              2.3 out of 3\r\n\r\n*SPBD measures the living conditions of each of its borrowers to track her loan progress. The overall social metric score, provided by SPBD, is based upon a number of factors, such as the condition of the house\/household assets, health, education, income level, and family reputation. A higher number represents a higher score. For example, a \"\"3 out of 3\"\" on education would mean that the borrower has graduated from university; a \"\"2 out of 3\"\" = secondary\/high-school, and a \"\"1 out of 3\"\" would mean that the borrower is uneducated.\r\n\r\nFor more information on this score, please see SPBD's partner page at: http:\/\/partners.kiva.org\/about\/aboutPartner?id=15\r\n\r\nAbout SPBD\r\nIn 2000, Greg Casagrande founded SPBD and since then, it has expanded from the main island of Upolu in Samoa to Savaii, as well as Tonga. SPBD's philosophy of lending is based upon the Grameen Bank lending method.\r\n\r\nPlease join SPBD's lending team on KIVA to receive on-the-spot updates on SPBD:

She is a single mother of five children; three of them are already married.  The son who lives with her helps her with household expenses. \r\n\r\nHer current house is made of reeds since, after the earthquake, she wasn't able to finish the construction.

There, she started her family with Hugo, with whom she has lived for twelve years. They have two children, Jony and Yamerin, who they care for with love and dedication. Like a good country woman, she is dedicated to farming. Her main crops are coffee and bananas, which are sown in her own agricultural lands, made up of one hectare of arable land. Since she doesn't have much capital to invest in her crops, she always worked with her community bank. \"I am one of the founders\", she affirms with a lot of pride. What she likes most about her work is to be able to sell her crops to the gatherers who visit her area. She mentions, \"I don't have to transport my merchandise.\" Additionally, she receives the support of her husband who works as farm laborer in different farming lands, earning extra money for the home. Now, Yanet ventured into the production of coffee nurseries, where she earns S.400 for each thousand grown. She also works in her free time making wooden drawers to hold the fruit they produce. She belongs to the \"Luz del future\" (Future light) community bank and this is the fourth loan with MFP, where she is very happy to know that she will have financial support.

She serves her customers there, the majority of which are students, teachers and passersby. She has been doing this for 2 years and is now well-known in the area. What she likes about her work is being able to count on an income, thanks to which she helps her partner with the household expenses, as he works in the wood industry and is often away from home for periods of upto 30 days. She plans to open a restaurant in her own home. This will be her 3rd loan with MFP. She is happy to have financial support to move her business forwards, which is why she agrees to be punctual with her repayments, as with her previous loans.

M. lives in the 20 de Julio neighborhood [named for July 20th, Colombia's Independence Day].  It is an area that combines a commercial zone and recreation area with a residential zone full of multi-family homes.  She runs a business making and selling clothes, which she started in 1995, after learning the trade in a family workshop in 1992.  She decided to take up this activity after working as a secretary at a private business, and today she feels very satisfied with her decision because her business generates work.\r\n\r\nYolanda works an 8AM to 7PM schedule from Monday to Saturday, and therefore produces many clothes.  She stays competitive by being timely and through the prices and quality of her products.  This way, she is able to remain stable in the market, because between the stores in central Barranquilla, friends, relatives, and references, she has many clients.  She needs to buy materials for her work every three days, so she must have cash on hand to do so.  Currently, she is requesting her first loan from Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She will purchase fabric, thread, and adornments for the clothes she is making.\r\n\r\nYolanda dreams of owning a boutique.  On a personal level, she feels very successful because her children are professionals, even though she is separated from their father.  This is representative of how hard she worked to give them an education and a good quality of life, so that they would be prepared for the future.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Katie

Corte, Carmen, Cebu. She earns her living by operating a general store business.  Her husband Roque, who is 37 years old, works as a painter to earn his living.  They have four children from 5 to 11 years old. \r\n\r\nEliza joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2008 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past four loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Eliza has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 11,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,100, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 5th loan, she is borrowing PHP 14,000, which she intends to use to add more stocks for her customers so that she can continue to save up for the future education of her children. \r\n\r\nEliza is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference  in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Con 30 a\u00f1os en este negocio desea para el futuro, incrementar la cantidad de le\u00f1a que tiene y as\u00ed tener plata para pagar los estudios superiores de su hijo, a quien cuida con mucho amor y siempre se ha preocupado por que no le falte nada. Hace poco sufri\u00f3 una operaci\u00f3n del ap\u00e9ndice, por lo que est\u00e1 en cama. Pero esta dificultad no la amilana, a contrario le ida fuerzas para salir adelante. En sus tiempos libres se dedica a la agricultura, con la siembra de lechuga, espinaca y arveja; los cuales despu\u00e9s de cuidarlos y fertilizarlos constantemente los comercializa en el mercado mayorista de la ciudad de Tarma. Ella disfruta de conversar con sus clientes y siempre suelta una broma para llevarse mejor con ellos, ya que su principal estrategia en la vida es la alegr\u00eda que le pone a todo lo que hace. Por ello est\u00e1 segura que podr\u00e1 ser una de las mejores agricultoras y comerciante de la zona. Ella pertenece al banco comunal \u201cVirgen Mar\u00eda\u201d y este es el noveno cr\u00e9dito con MFP, donde espera de su colaboraci\u00f3n para continuar con sus objetivos. Por otro lado se compromete una vez m\u00e1s a cumplir con el pago de sus cuotas, como en anteriores cr\u00e9ditos que tuvo. Adem\u00e1s le agrada ser parte de su banco comunal porque todos sus integrantes son personas responsables y muy solidarias. Soledad de recibir su apoyo; invertir\u00e1 el dinero solicitado en la compra de 4 bolsas de semilla de arveja que oscila entre los S\/. 375 soles cada uno y el resto comprar\u00e1 abono org\u00e1nico para esparcirlos entre sus sembr\u00edos de espinaca. \n\n","en":"Soledad, 53, lives in Palcamayo.  She is notable for being a hard working, sincere woman.  She lives in her own house with her youngest son, Alan, 24, who always helps her with her work.  Every morning, starting very early, Soledad has to divide her time among several activities.  She sells firewood, that\u2019s in quite high demand from her customers, all day.  With 30 years in this business she wants for the future to increase the amount of firewood she has in order to have money to pay for her son\u2019s higher education; she cares for him with much love and has always seen to it that he\u2019s had everything he needs.\r\n\r\nShe recently had surgery on her appendix so is bedridden.  But this difficulty doesn\u2019t discourage her; on the contrary it\u2019s given her strength to continue forward.  During her free time she farms lettuce, spinach and peas which, after caring for and fertilizing them constantly, she sells in Tarma\u2019s wholesale market.  She enjoys chatting with her customers and jokes around with them to get along with them better since her main strategy in life is to put joy into everything she does.  Because of this she\u2019s sure that she can become one of the best farmers and merchants in the zone.\r\n\r\nShe belongs to the \u201cVirgen Mar\u00eda\u201d (Virgin Mary) communal bank and this is the 9th loan with MFP where she hopes to have your collaboration to continue toward her goals.  On the other hand, she commits to making her payments like she\u2019s done with previous loans.  Besides, she enjoys being part of the communal bank because all the members are responsible, mutually supportive people.  \r\n\r\nIf Soledad were to receive the support of the requested loan, she\u2019d use it to buy four sacks of pea seeds which cost around 375 soles each and would use the rest to buy organic manure to spread among her spinach crops.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":925,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":925,"image":{"id":806510,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":" to buy four sacks of pea seeds and sacks of organic manure.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2011-07-10T22:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":925,"lender_count":31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Soledad ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-06-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2500,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":925,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-07-15T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":2500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":925}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":925,"local_amount":2500,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:26Z","rounded_local_amount":2539.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276712707}],"funded_date":"2011-07-11T01:57:07Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T10:31:26Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":318180,"name":"Mariam","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mariam is a 26-year-old Lebanese married woman living with her husband and two school-aged children.

She is married with 3 children aged between 7 and 14 years.They all go to school. She is a farmer and she has been growing maize for the past 8 years. Also her husband is a farmer. With the loan from Kiva, she would like to pay workers who harvested maize. The profits from the business will be used to renovate her house and to buy a cow. \n\nThe agriculture sector accounts for 37% of Rwanda's gross domestic product, generates 65% of Rwanda's export revenue, and employs approximately 90% of Rwandans (as of 2009). Despite the importance of agriculture to Rwandans and their economy, financial institutions view lending to fund agricultural activities as a high-risk proposition because the profitability of these activities is affected by weather, natural disasters, and price fluctuations. For this reason, farmers in Rwanda remain under served by financial institutions. Urwego Opportunity Bank is expanding into this market and is happy to provide Kiva lenders with the opportunity to support Rwandan farmers."}},"status":"inactive_expired","funded_amount":0,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":null,"image":{"id":1891308,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":["Rural Exclusion"],"use":"To pay workers who harvested maize.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"RW","country":"Rwanda","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"-2 30","type":"point"}},"partner_id":161,"posted_date":null,"planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1800,"lender_count":0,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Devothe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2015-04-29T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"RWF","disbursal_amount":1233600,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1800,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":1233600}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2015-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1800}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":null,"paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":982837,"name":"Anita","description":{"languages":["es"],"texts":{"es":"ANITA: Es una se\u00f1ora sonriente de 53 a\u00f1os de edad, pertenece a la etnia miskita del municipio de Puerto Cabezas, casada, con 11 hijos mayores de edad.

She has a small farm where she farms the crop and she also a couple of cattle. Aracely lives with her husband and three children who are in school. She will invest her money in pesticides and feed for her cattle. With the extra profits she hopes she can purchase a cow and continue to provide her kids with an eduction. <\/p>\r\n<p>She is the latest addition to one of the new Communal Banks in the Mifex Rural Finance Program.  All of the members of the 10 de enero Communal Bank are part of an Association of Rice Farmers in Salitre named 10 de enero. They will use the microloans to prepare the lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each others guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the 10 de enero Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but is imperative for the communities Mifex works with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n \r\n<h4>Loan Use and Repayment<\/h4>\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to create water deposits that will prevent flooding in the case of heavy rains or store water in case of droughts. They will also be used to treat the land prior to farming,  to plant the seeds and purchase fertilizer. The loan repayment schedule is also different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 5 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the sixth and final month. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Salitre compiled by the staff at Mifex when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Salitre<\/h4>\r\n<p>Salitre is a rural sector in the Province of Guayas known as the capital of Montuvios (montuvio is a cowboy) with approximately 30,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are herding and agriculture which make up about 80% of the economy. The infrastructure and basic services are poor,  especially the roads and water services.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is highly dedicated to farming rice and cattle ranching. Rice is a crop that yields about every four months. In order to farm rice, the environment must be very humid and there must be a high volume of water. The lack of a structured water system makes it difficult for the small farmers to be highly productive. The best months for cultivating rice are early in the year when it is the rainy season in the coast of Ecuador. <\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is a national tourist attraction as many Ecuadorians visit the fresh water Salitre River. There are cottages, small restaurants and water attractions that people come to enjoy.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n<p>There are not many financial institutions that provides services to the productive sector of the local economy. The primary access to credit comes from loan sharks who charge extremely high interest rates averaging around 20% a month. The locals are also exploited by the intermediaries that buy their products in order to commercialize them in the city and to export abroad. These intermediaries buy crops in advance at very low prices, finance soil at extremely high prices and often provide emergency loans for even higher interest rates than the loan sharks.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n  \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>Salitre is a dangerous sector considering it is in the rural area. There is a high incidence of robbery of cattle that results in many of the ranch owners owning weapons to protect their property. Because the police are not present in these areas, farmers and ranchers must apply their own laws and provide their own security. In some instances they have formed their own cooperatives and associations to have a community crime prevention effort.<\/p> \r\n  \r\n<p>Salitre is in the lowlands of Ecuador and is vulnerable to flooding in the rainy season. In the event of a heavy rainy season, often at its worse when El Ni\u00f1o occurs, the farmers of rice lose many of their crops. All this is due to a lack of infrastructure in the area.<\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":35666,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Pesticides for rice","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Salitre","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-1.833333 -79.8","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-05-11T06:27:22Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aracely","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-05-26T12:57:30Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-07-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200},{"due_date":"2008-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-12T22:26:54Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":31438},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-08T22:31:13Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40412},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-09-11T19:40:50Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53264},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-29T23:32:44Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73636},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-11-30T00:40:42Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":88540},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-12-18T17:47:39Z","settlement_date":"2007-12-20T02:12:09Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":99036}],"funded_date":"2007-05-12T12:57:30Z","paid_date":"2007-12-18T17:47:39Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":14142,"name":"Zarmena","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Zarmena lives in district 15 of Kabul, Afghanistan.
