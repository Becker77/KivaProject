She doesn't need to invest too much money in it because she produces the feed which she gives to her animals herself.  In the future, she would like to have more cows and other animals to raise.\r\n\r\nThis is Teva's first loan with MFP and she is happy to know that she has financial support.  She also likes being a member of her community bank because all the members are people that she knows.  They are all responsible and very supportive of each other.\r\n\r\nTeva is grateful to the people who will fund her loan as it will be very useful to her in making progress in her business.  She will invest her loan money in buying some sheep.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":678283,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Dairy","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To buy sheep","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-12-26T17:20:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Teva ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-11-29T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-08T07:00:00Z","amount":700}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":250,"local_amount":700,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:34:07Z","rounded_local_amount":700.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216549670}],"funded_date":"2010-12-26T19:24:18Z","paid_date":"2011-07-15T11:34:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Linda Oxnard","image":null}},{"id":265311,"name":"Rizalito","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rizalito D. is from the village of Tagdo, Mambajao, Camiguin Province.

She lives in Manapla, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2002 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. By working hard in her fishing\/fish vending business, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 10,000. Ma. Lida is borrowing PHP 13,000 so that she can fund her business operations. This will be her 22nd loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 15,000, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Ma. Lida aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future wellbeing by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed upon a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Ella es una joven muy emprendedora con muchos deseos de superaci\u00f3n y de ver a su hija en mejores condiciones a las que ella ha tenido.

Este negocio es la principal fuente de ingresos de Ayde ya que la situaci\u00f3n de su esposo no es estable y hay algunos meses que no recibe remesas ya que su esposo no cuenta con un trabajo fijo en el pa\u00eds en que se encuentra.

Esto la motivo a solicitar este cr\u00e9dito a INTEGRAL para invertir en su tienda en la compra de variedad de productos tales como: verduras, arroz, az\u00facar, frijoles, pan dulce, bebidas, detergente, golosinas. Etc. Sinceramente espera poder mejorar su calidad de vida y la de su familia. \n\n","en":"Ayde Esperanza, 27 years old, lives in her home with her dear daughter Liliana who's 7 years old. The reason that Ayde lives alone is because her life partner emigrated to the United States several years ago and with the help of his arduous work she has been able to stay afloat. She is a very entrepreneurial young person with a great desire for self-improvement and seeing her daughter in better conditions than those which she has had. Several years ago she managed to establish a small store in her home residence from which she sells a diversity of products like: candy, oil, sweet bread, cereals, vegetables, shoes, and many other things. This business is the main source of income for Ayde since her husband's situation is not stable and there are some months when she doesn't receive a remittance of money as her husband is not able to rely on a permanent job in the country in which he finds himself. She has been thinking a lot about how to make her store grow and manage to increase the level in sales as for the time being this is the only way to manage to support herself economically. This motivated her to apply to Integral for a loan in order to invest in her store purchasing a variety products such as: vegetables, rice, sugar, beans, sweet bread, drinks, detergent, candy, etc. She sincerely hopes to be able to better her quality of life and that of her family.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":876780,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy a variety of products like: vegetables, rice, sugar, beans, sweet bread, drinks, detergent, candies, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2011-09-24T18:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ayde Esperanza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-09-06T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-10-06T07:00:00Z","amount":34.23},{"due_date":"2011-11-06T07:00:00Z","amount":34.91},{"due_date":"2011-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":36.71},{"due_date":"2012-01-06T08:00:00Z","amount":37.58},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2012-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":41.19},{"due_date":"2012-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":41.97},{"due_date":"2012-05-06T07:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2012-06-06T07:00:00Z","amount":45.15},{"due_date":"2012-07-06T07:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2012-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":48.56},{"due_date":"2012-09-06T07:00:00Z","amount":49.9}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.23},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.91},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.71},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.58},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.19},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.97},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.81},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.15},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.99},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.56},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.9}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.34,"local_amount":38.34,"processed_date":"2011-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-11-15T09:20:17Z","rounded_local_amount":38.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":238546120},{"amount":38.04,"local_amount":38.04,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:12:59Z","rounded_local_amount":38.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244505709},{"amount":36.99,"local_amount":36.99,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T09:16:41Z","rounded_local_amount":36.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250713185},{"amount":37.87,"local_amount":37.87,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T09:27:56Z","rounded_local_amount":37.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257116038},{"amount":39.3,"local_amount":39.3,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T08:28:26Z","rounded_local_amount":39.3,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263241152},{"amount":309.46,"local_amount":309.46,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T08:24:20Z","rounded_local_amount":309.46,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":269966102}],"funded_date":"2011-09-27T10:04:19Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T08:24:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Shannon Birk","image":null}},{"id":343194,"name":"New Horizons [Nuevos Horizontes] Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La se\u00f1ora Aracely Feliciana es casada, tiene 28 a\u00f1os D. edad, curs\u00f3 los grados D. estudios primarios, tiene 2 hijos 1 D. los cuales estudia, se dedica ala tejedur\u00eda D. telas t\u00edpicas: servilletas, cortes, y sabanas; inici\u00f3 este trabajo como operaria y hasta el momento lleva 12 a\u00f1os D. experiencia, cuenta con el poyo D. su esposo quien se dedica al mismo trabajo.\n\nOrganiza un grupo con el fin D. solicitar un pr\u00e9stamo que servir\u00e1 para la compra D. materiales: hilos y labores D. diferentes dise\u00f1os y colores, el el futuro espera contar con suficiente capital y mejorar sus ingresos.

The older daughter is married and lives separately with her family, two daughters are at school, the older son works in construction, and the younger one is a farmer.\r\n\r\nIn order to earn money to meet their daily needs, this family breeds cattle. At the moment they keep four cows and Jyparkul sells about 50-60 liters of milk a day. In this way she earns about 12,000 soms per month.

They have been able to slowly build their home out of hard work, although it is still admittedly in need of much improvement. Maria has a 7 year old daughter who she works hard to feed and educate. Her husband is a field worker who is mostly employed in big farms outside of their town. Meanwhile, Maria tends to their own piece of land with the help of Mario whenever he is out of work or she really needs him. They hope to invest in fertilizer and pesticides to preserve the crops they have already planted. <\/p>\r\n<h4>Communal Banking in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>This borrower is part of one the new Communal Banks formed in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program. All of the members of the Anzuelo Baba Communal Bank are part of an association of rice farmers in the county of Baba in rural Ecuador. Their organization, El Anzuelo Asociacion, works cooperatively to help their members cultivate rice and commercialize the product after it has grown. Most recently, El Anzuelo was able to start a program that improved their members access to watering services.  \r\n<\/p> \r\n<p>The members of La Asociacion El Anzuelo de Baba will use the micro-loans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. Because they form part of a communal bank, they are all each other\u2019s guarantors for the loan. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many micro-finance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties. <\/p> \r\n<p><i>Below is more information about Baba compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. <\/i><\/p> \r\n<h4>Economy of Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>The people of Baba have been organized since the days of Gran Colombia when Ecuador was yet to be a country. The area has always been popular because of the extremely productive lands that gave way to cultivation of cacao for decades. Now Baba is a county in the province of Los Rios in the coastal region of Ecuador. For most of the latter part of the 20th Century it was a cacao and banana producing sector. Most of the surrounding areas of Baba in Los Rios are owned by large mulitnational  \r\ncompanies such as Dole, but Baba is a sector characterized by the small and informal farms. <\/p>\r\n<p>Rice production has now turned into the main economic activity of the sector as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Cacao is still very popular in the area, but because of the long cultivation cycle people prefer to invest in rice. The lands in Baba are very fertile though, and most farmers in the sector often grow other crops, such as plantains and soy beans  \r\nas secondary sources of income.  Many farmers also keep livestock as emergency sources of food and income, commonly resorting to selling a chicken or pig if they are in need of cash. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Baba<\/h4> \r\n<p>Most of the people in the Baba area are small farmers. They produce about 80 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds, plowing and leveling the lands. This is the most difficult part for the farmers in Baba, who often lack the necessary machinery to properly plow the lands for rice production. After appropriately preparing the lands, the farmers fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as boleo in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them gather their production. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4> \r\n<p>One of the biggest struggles in the area has been the lack of credit due to the absence of any type of financial institution. \r\nBecause people do not count on formal financing, they have turned to loan sharks, paying between 100% and 240% annual interest.  Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also lack skills and knowledge to commercialize their products and earn fair prices for their crops. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Risks<\/h4> \r\n<p>The largest risk in the sector is due to absence of watering systems. Although Baba is in the province \u201cLos Rios\u201d (the rivers) there is a severe problem with access to water. The lack of infrastructure in the sector does not allow the small farmers to benefit from the presence of the many rivers in the area. If the winter season is too dry, it is likely that the lands will not be sufficiently fertile for rice production in the summer. On the other hand, if there is too much rain there are not any drainage systems to prevent flooding and the crops are often ruined. Generally speaking though, Baba is a very productive sector where the lands yield all types of crops including rice, cacao, corn, watermelons, plantains, and soy beans. <\/p> \r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4> \r\n<p>The loans in this sector will mostly be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. Many clients will use the capital towards renting machinery and equipment necessary to effectively work and prepare the fields. Clients also typically use a part of the loan to buy livestock in order to raise and have as reserves. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical micro-entrepreneur because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures. Mifex asks our rural clients only to pay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan.

At the age of 18 she married her husband with whom she has 5 children. She tried working as a housekeeper but couldn\u2019t stand it, so she started her own small business at the age of 19.

According to Ilda, the business is contributing positively to her family\u2019s needs since she is able to help her husband in supporting the children and covering the household expenses. She currently works with one of her daughters and one employee. With the help of the loan, she was able to strengthen her business by increasing the volume of products and acquiring one additional public telephone.\r\n\r\n<p>Her business has had a positive impact on the community by providing communication services and essential products, thereby reducing the distances traveled to obtain these services.

Little by little, and with a lot of hard work, Arturo improved his shop and invested in it until he was able to supply groceries, fruit and veg. He confirms that it was very hard to start with, and accessing his house was difficult for suppliers. And so he had to carry goods from the road to his house. But he chose not to give up despite this problem, he felt that the advantages of the business were not only for him but also for the community.

Because she liked her job, she started saving money little by little so that she could become independent and set up her own business.

Little by little, she started adding school supplies such as maps, rubber stamps, printer paper, notebooks, pens, pencils, etc. She managed to expand and now offers a great variety of products. <p>\r\nShe needs a loan of $375.00 USD, which she will repay in 3 months, so that she can purchase a copy machine and some merchandise.

He is a baker.  His workday begins very early in the morning, at about 4:30am, when he gets up to start kneading the dough and making the bread which everyone in the neighborhood enjoys.  Adolfo is a very skilled baker because he learned the craft as a little boy from his father.  What he most likes about the job is baking bread which he does with great care.  He has had this occupation for 30 years and he considers the most difficult part having to get up so early in the morning every day since for him there is no such thing as weekends or holidays.  For later in the future, he would like to set up a store to sell the bread that he himself bakes.  This is his first loan with MFP and he doesn't want to fail to repay it for lack of money so he is willing to save day by day to repay it.  Besides, he is very responsible and respectful toward the other members.

They live together in the town of Santa Rosa, located in Ayacucho's tropical rainforest, where they have their own house.\r\n\r\nIt all began when her parents gave her a small plot of land so she could work and grow cocoa and coffee, but she never thought that she would like it so much.  Once she reached adulthood, her parents gave Alejandra her independence, and of course her parents were keeping an eye on their daughter's progress.  Now she sells to the big wholesalers in her town, who give her a good profit margin with respect to her previous sales.  At any rate, she is grateful to her parents for the good lessons they gave her.\r\n\r\nAlejandra generally receives help from her husband, but at harvest time she needs hired workers to help her get her products to the sales points and sell at a competitive price.  Her future plans are to expand her production so that she can earn more income.\r\n\r\nThis is her fifth loan with MFP, and she promises to continue paying on schedule.  Besides, she is happy with her communal bank, as it gives her many benefits.  Alejandra is thinking of investing the requested loan in maintenance for her cocoa fields, with the goal of preventing anything that could adversely affect their production.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Danielle Maxson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":578979,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Maintenance of cocoa fields","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Ayacucho","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-13.158333 -74.223889","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-08-06T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Alejandra ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2042.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191463061}],"funded_date":"2010-08-06T17:52:38Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":224346,"name":"Francisca","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Sra.

She earns her living by operating two business ventures:  tailoring and a general store business.  Her husband Francisco, who is 66 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities.  They have 12 children who are between 11 and 41 years old. Purita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 27 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Purita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 26,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 12,000,  uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 28th loan, she is borrowing PHP 28,000, to buy materials and equipment for tailoring and stock for her store so that she can continue to save up for her children's future education and to get a better job.

She lives in the city of Cartagena, where she has a store called \u201cThe Thrifty One\u201d.  Its name honors the low prices at which she offers her products, while still making a profit for herself.\r\n\r\nHer customers live in her neighborhood and areas near her business, where she offers food, supplies and beverages at retail.  Antonia knows her business very well since she knows that, when she buys in bulk volumes, she makes a better profit than when buying supplies little by little.  This is the reason she turns to Kiva credit, as it will allow her to buy products in larger quantities and therefore at discounts that she can then pass along to her customers.  She wants them to be happy and to continue to buy from her.

He has been working as an independent farmer for the last five years, the same kind of work he has done since he was a child helping his parents. Every day he checks his fields to make sure his crops are free from pests. Recently he applied insecticiD. (the used bags are shown in the photo). He grows a range of the crops best suited to the area.\r\nHansen knows that profit from agriculture is realised after six months, so he has found a temporary job to earn money during that time. He works in the local municipality office in the afternoons. Currently he has more projects in development, one of which is investing in a new business to improve crop production.

She lives in her father's house, who she wants to give a tranquil old age.  What she wants most is to get ahead in life.  For Petronila, livestock husbandry is an activity that comes from her family as she learned how to do it from a young age. She currently carries out this work and is very good at doing it.  Her livestock is very sought after in the Huancane and Juliaca markets. What she most likes about her work is to graze her animals and to be outside in the fresh air.  She has been doing this activity for 15 years and the most difficult part for her is to take her animals to the different markets to sell them. In the future she hopes to increase her number of heads of livestock  to improve her income. This is Petronila\u2019s first loan with MFP and she feels happy about the opportunity it provides. In her communal bank she is a much loved member as she always helps in everything required.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  Today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nTajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged an already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients present a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Her husband makes furniture for a living, and they have three children who are studying.  She has a shop where she sells diapers.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw that the women in her area needed a place to buy disposable diapers for their children, Diana decided to invest her savings in diapers and sell them to people she knew.  Little by little and with much effort and dedication, she acquired a space and converted it into a store to sell diapers and other baby items.\r\n\r\nIn order to make her business more profitable, Diana would like to use her loan to buy diapers, bottles, and other items for babies.  In the future, she would like to expand her business and open multiple branches.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mairead Harris, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":554806,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase of diapers and baby bottles","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Guayaquil (Suburbio)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-06-16T11:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Diana Espinoza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-06-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-05T07:00:00Z","amount":65.31},{"due_date":"2010-08-05T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2010-09-05T07:00:00Z","amount":65.7},{"due_date":"2010-10-05T07:00:00Z","amount":67.6},{"due_date":"2010-11-05T07:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2010-12-05T08:00:00Z","amount":70.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":72.02},{"due_date":"2011-02-05T08:00:00Z","amount":73.69},{"due_date":"2011-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":75.74},{"due_date":"2011-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":76.28}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.31},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.21},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.7},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":67.6},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.79},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":70.66},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.02},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":73.69},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":75.74},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.28}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":65.31,"local_amount":65.31,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:10:04Z","rounded_local_amount":65.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159631939},{"amount":64.21,"local_amount":64.21,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:21Z","rounded_local_amount":64.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166845825},{"amount":65.48,"local_amount":65.48,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:46Z","rounded_local_amount":65.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172112099},{"amount":67.82,"local_amount":67.82,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:56:39Z","rounded_local_amount":67.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405505},{"amount":68.79,"local_amount":68.79,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:05:29Z","rounded_local_amount":68.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182543980},{"amount":70.66,"local_amount":70.66,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:08:05Z","rounded_local_amount":70.66,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188680735},{"amount":72.02,"local_amount":72.02,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:46:14Z","rounded_local_amount":72.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191379074},{"amount":73.69,"local_amount":73.69,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:24:30Z","rounded_local_amount":73.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195797069},{"amount":75.74,"local_amount":75.74,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:21:22Z","rounded_local_amount":75.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201239243},{"amount":76.28,"local_amount":76.28,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-19T07:45:48Z","rounded_local_amount":76.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206105696}],"funded_date":"2010-06-27T12:50:46Z","paid_date":"2011-05-19T07:45:48Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mairead Harris","image":500788}},{"id":212072,"name":"Otgonbayar","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Shirnen Otgonbayar is 39 years old and lives with her five children in Darkhan province, one of Mongolia's big provinces.

With the children\u2019s help, she processes the oil into soap, which she then sells at the local weekly markets. \r\n\r\nWith her loan, she will buy barrels of oil to be used in soap making.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to bolster her income in order to meet her personal needs and better provide for the children in her care.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Nathalie Pelletier, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3475,"image":{"id":594497,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Develop and promote her business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"Agence de Ziguinchor","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14 -14","type":"point"}},"partner_id":105,"posted_date":"2010-09-03T15:40:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3475,"lender_count":78,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Awa ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Balakiss","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Taye","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fanseyni","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Awa Meta","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nounmou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Abibatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maryse","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-08-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":1770000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-02-09T08:00:00Z","amount":1770000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":3475,"local_amount":1770000,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-24T08:26:21Z","rounded_local_amount":1782344.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195813988}],"funded_date":"2010-09-07T05:12:37Z","paid_date":"2011-03-24T08:26:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":232558,"name":"Peter Macharia","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Peter has been in the motorcycle transport business since 2008.

and selling household appliances. She lives in Purok Doridad, Brgy Plaridel, Sagay City, Negros Occidental. She has been a member of NWTF-Project Dungganon since 2004 and has improved her living conditions with the help of her loans from NWTF and through her own efforts. \r\n\r\nBy working hard in her buying and selling of household appliances, she is gradually making her family more economically stable. She now earns an average monthly income of PHP 4000. Leah is now borrowing PHP 21,000 to use as additional working capital for the business.  This will be her 11th loan from NWTF-Project Dungganon. Her previous loan of PHP 19,500, which she paid off well within its term, was just another step in her journey toward economic freedom. Leah aspires to elevate her family's living conditions and ensure their future well-being by following the Dungganon way. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: \r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed on a member of a community who has earned respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

So, in order to financially assist her family, she makes embroidered clothes and also sells cloth. She buys clothes from the markets of Multan and sells them to her local area clients for good profit. Basically, she is a very creative lady and loves to craft beautiful embroidered dresses. She sells her embroidered dresses to different boutiques and people admire her talent and give her good orders.  \r\n\r\nSaeeda is also a very good wife and mother. She is married to F. who also has a business of embroidery. She is bringing up her 6 children with great care. Her elder son does his own business, while her remaining children are getting their education. \r\n\r\nSaeeda has applied for a loan from Kiva partner Asasah in order to improve her clothes selling business. She will utilize the loan to purchase clothes in bulk quantity that will help her offer more variety to her clients and make more sales. She is hopeful that, in this way, she will be able to make more money and provide better living facilities to her family. \r\n\r\nNote: In the photo, the lady with a book (called Asasah Passbook) is

They live together in their own home which is located in the indigenous community of Santa Mar\u00eda.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her young age, Benilda has achieved many things.  She has eight plots of land where she grows coffee, annatto, bananas and corn.  These are her main crops.  She works with a lot of care, from very early in the morning until nightfall, as she knows that this is the only source of support for her family.  In addition to being very smart, Benilda makes the most of her time as she also raises hens which she fattens and then sells at a higher price.  She has nine years experience and what she most enjoys about her work is her independence as she has freedom with her money and the freedom to make her own decisions in order to improve her business.  The difficulty she faces is a lack of support.  For this reason, she constantly has to hire laborers to help her maintain and develop her crops.

Thi Hang is 30 years old. She has 3 school-going children. She joined the TYM Fund in 2000 and borrowed 1 million VND to invest in her clothes shop in the market. Even though the loan was small, it helped to increase her family's income as it was used effectively. Since then, she has borrowed increasing amounts to further invest in her clothes business. As she is friendly and charges reasonable prices, she gets more and more customers and so her family's income is increasingly stable. Beside the income from the clothes shop, her family also has additional income from her husband who is working as a driver. Therefore, her family's income is stable and her children can go to school. This time, she wants to borrow 19 millions VND (1,150USD) to purchase more clothes for the shop. Her family's average monthly income is 5 millions VND (about 322USD).\r\n<p> <b>Translated from Vietnamese by Pham Yen Thanh, Kiva Volunteer.<\/b><p>\r\nCh\u1ecb Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb H\u1eb1ng n\u0103m nay 30 tu\u1ed5i.

She was also able to study cosmetology. \r\n\r\nDelfina needs a loan of 1000 soles to buy a blender, beer, and sodas.\r\n\r\nDelfina's dream is to open up a hair salon.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Cynthia McMurry, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":339774,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy a blender, beer and sodas","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":70,"posted_date":"2009-06-25T13:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Delfina Emperatriz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-07-09T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T13:29:07Z","rounded_local_amount":261.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63171491},{"amount":87.5,"local_amount":250,"processed_date":"2009-08-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T14:52:34Z","rounded_local_amount":261.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73596795},{"amount":175,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T16:56:04Z","rounded_local_amount":523.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87032187}],"funded_date":"2009-06-25T15:30:44Z","paid_date":"2009-10-15T16:56:04Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Cynthia McMurry","image":924798}},{"id":121098,"name":"Anorhol","description":{"languages":["ru","en"],"texts":{"ru":"\u041c\u0438\u0441\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0410\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0445\u043e\u043b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0412\u0430\u0440\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442 63 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430. \u0417\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c, \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0435\u0442. \u0410\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0445\u043e\u043b \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u043c\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043c \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c, \u0442.\u043a. \u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u043c \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043c\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442. \u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c \u0431\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 12 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430.","en":"Anorhol M. lives in the Varzob district.

She is married to a customs officer, and her business allows her, among other things, to contribute financially to the care of her family. She began this business in 1982; it is thus a field which she has mastered perfectly thanks to the length of experience already in her favour. With time, she was able to find out from her customers that she could also successfully sell different types of fabric, jewelry, and pearls. It is for this reason that she is seeking a loan through WAGES (one of Kiva's field partners) to buy a bale of fabric; at the same time, this loan will serve to buy pearls and jewelry of varying quality.

She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to pay the tuition fees of her children. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 25 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly of farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.  Given that manual translation of entrepreneur profiles is costly, Kiva created this template for our Field Partner to allow them to continue to post loans in English while providing quality and accurate information to Kiva lenders."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":125,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":125,"image":{"id":434998,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

She is 34 years old and has been separated from her husband for 12 years since he left the country to try and offer them a better future, but on arriving at his destination he forgot about his family. Their union had resulted in a daughter who is now 11 years old and studies in a school in the city. Monica does not have her own house so she lives in her parents' house.\r\n\r\nMonica works as a domestic servant and also works in her mother's bar. For the moment she is in charge since her parent has been sick. She works at the bar only weekends and  in her free time she works selling clothing which she has been doing for 3 months. With this loan she will buy pants, shirts, blouses, skirts, dresses, and other accessories for all family members in order to have a ready stock of items for her demanding clients.\r\n\r\nHer greatest dream is to have her own house.\r\n\r\nSe\u00f1ora Rosa P. lives in the El Cruce de Sinincay area, is 44 years old, and is married.

Her second son works in Hidropaute and only comes to the house on weekends. He helps Rosa a little with the economy of the home. Her third son works and studies at the university. The 2 next children continue studying in high school. Her husband is a professional mason. Thanks to the sacrifice of the family they have been able to build their own house.\r\n\r\nRose had a stand where she butchered pigs and prepared rich dishes but a year and a half ago she got a gallbladder illness and had to give up that work. Now she works in the cafe of a high school where she has been for eight months.\r\n\r\nShe has been a member of the communal bank for 10 years, thanks to an invitation from her cousin. With previous loans she maintained her stand and with the new loan she will pay some debts acquired in her previous business that have accumulated.\r\n\r\nHer goal is to improve the state of her

The group is composed of fifteen women, all from the same village, who average 30 years of age and who are married mothers of at least three children each.  The following members, Mb\u00e8ne T., Fatou D., Binta T., Fatou F., Seynabou N., Daba Codou D., Awa F., and Sophie S. have just joined the group and are on their first (loan) cycle.  They formed their solidarity group by affinity and meet regularly to discuss the right way to organize their affiliation.  \r\n\r\nThe area where the Banc Villageois is established is very favorable to commerce due to the weekly markets which faciliate the women's businesses, such as the fattening of cattle and\/or sheep, small-scale commerce, the production and sale of peanut oil, the sale of fresh fish, etc.  Given this, most of the women of the village are devoting all their time to lucrative work.  And this new loan will enable them to increase their level of self-financing in order to develop their businesses further.  \r\n\r\nMs. Kh\u00e9messe F.

Her five children are all grown up.  She now lives with her husband and their youngest child.  For more than 10 years, heir family main income has come from pigs breeding.  After deducting the cost of piglets and food for them, each year she earns some hundreds USD in profit.  This money is rather enough for her to pay for the living expenses.  One of the advantages she has is that her children all have their own jobs, and they sometimes help her with the weekly repayment.  This year, thinking that she is getting old, Mrs. H. intends to buy a cow, raise and later sell it.  This job is easier than breeding pigs.

The majority of their children are under the age of 15.  They tell us that it is difficult for them to support their large families with the current situation in the country, since basic supplies have risen in price substantially and the few resources that they can obtain do not give them enough to live on.  \r\n <p>\r\nMost of them are dedicated chiefly to crafts, being carpenters.  They produce furniture with old designs in carved wood.  Also they weave sweaters with Alpaca wool and  aguayos (blanket woven with native designs), products that they offer to tourist stores in the city of La Paz.  The \"Kullaquitas\" association needs to increase its capital for the purchase of materials. In this way they hope to increase their production and acquire their own stores to sell their products directly.

Most of the women have displays of goods at the central market of Thi\u00e8s, where they sell vegetables, fish, jewelry, cloth, etc.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1050,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1050,"image":{"id":320114,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Home Products Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To buy local products in weekly rural marketplaces and fishing areas for resale in town ","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2009-05-18T19:10:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1050,"lender_count":37,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bousso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Moussou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Coumba ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Soda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Oumy","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1050,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":83333.33},{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":83333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":175}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-06-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T04:28:02Z","rounded_local_amount":84204.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53038103},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-07-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T20:51:53Z","rounded_local_amount":84204.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63262217},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-08-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T23:39:58Z","rounded_local_amount":84204.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73703198},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-09-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-29T12:02:18Z","rounded_local_amount":84204.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87132784},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.33,"processed_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T08:33:25Z","rounded_local_amount":84204.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97047051},{"amount":175,"local_amount":83333.35,"processed_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T15:19:15Z","rounded_local_amount":84204.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103892597}],"funded_date":"2009-05-20T09:53:18Z","paid_date":"2009-12-15T15:19:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":112922,"name":"Judith","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Judith T. is from the village of Yahong,Tudela,Misamis Occidental.

For lack of funds, she buys her onions at retail price making it difficult to make a profit. She requests a loan to travel to the northern region of Ghana so that she can buy onions in bags.

Each day, Lucia struggles to make ends meet and to provide for her children's needs, and for this reason she is requesting this loan to invest in her business. In the future, she would like to further expand her business and sell clothing. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":398908,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Capital de Trabajo","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Leon","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"12.435556 -86.879444","type":"point"}},"partner_id":96,"posted_date":"2009-10-22T01:10:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia Del Carmen ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":9800,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":816.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":816.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.66},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.66}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":41.7,"local_amount":817.37,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T12:33:56Z","rounded_local_amount":858.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103790779},{"amount":41.63,"local_amount":815.97,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T13:31:15Z","rounded_local_amount":857.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110681275},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":816.67,"processed_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T11:34:22Z","rounded_local_amount":857.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118075805},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":816.67,"processed_date":"2010-02-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:08:17Z","rounded_local_amount":857.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123911814},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":816.67,"processed_date":"2010-03-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-06T07:50:22Z","rounded_local_amount":857.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":130493250},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":816.67,"processed_date":"2010-04-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T10:19:10Z","rounded_local_amount":857.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136675934},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":816.67,"processed_date":"2010-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":857.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144710311},{"amount":41.66,"local_amount":816.67,"processed_date":"2010-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-16T07:39:18Z","rounded_local_amount":857.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":152045644},{"amount":41.67,"local_amount":816.67,"processed_date":"2010-07-02T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-16T08:44:10Z","rounded_local_amount":857.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159760886},{"amount":125,"local_amount":2449.97,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:16:42Z","rounded_local_amount":2573.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166847913}],"funded_date":"2009-10-23T20:32:59Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:16:42Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":145787,"name":"Osagie","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Osagie is 38 years old and married with two children.

They work in agriculture and in raising livestock in the province of Lambayeque, located a little over two hours from the city of Chicalayo.\r\n\r\nGusnara has worked for three years raising smaller animals such as sheep and pigs.  It is normal for the village settlers to let their animals roam freely in the abundant countryside, and at night, the animals each return to their respective farmyards.  When the animals reach a good size, they sell them to traders who routinely visit the area.  This provides Gusnara some earnings that allow her to help her spouse, a farmer, to support the family.\r\n\r\nGusnara would like to acquire more animals to fatten and to sell so that she can receive additional income that would help her sustain her family.  With this objective in mind, she is compelled to request a loan for the first time through Kiva partner Edpyme Alternativa in the amount of $300.\r\n\r\nGusnara is a woman devoted to her family, always looking out for their collective well-being.

Con el tiempo, espera comprar m\u00e1s tierras y as\u00ed incrementar su producci\u00f3n.Este es el segundo pr\u00e9stamo que tiene con MFP y esta ahorrando para pagar sus cuotas a tiempo, ya que no quiere causarle problemas a las integrantes  de su banco comunal, donde se siente muy contenta de pertenecer a este grupo ya que todos trabajan con responsabilidad. Gricelda tiene planeado invertir  los dos mil nuevos soles solicitados, en la compra de abono y fertilizantes, para hacer m\u00e1s productiva su tierra.","en":"Gricelda, 42 years old, is a cheerful and hard-working woman.  She lives in her own house with her husband Edmundo (62) and her 6 young children, who are the reason for all her efforts.  The long hours of work that she has put into her land have taught her much about agriculture.  Her crops are well-known and always fetch a good price when she sells them.  What she likes most about her work is cultivating the land, which is something she has done since she was a girl.  She has spent the last 10 years in this work, and considers the most difficult part to be transporting her crops to market in the city because of the uneven highway.  With time, she hopes to buy more land and thus increase her production.  \r\n\r\nThis is the second loan she has gotten from MFP and is saving to make her payments on time.  She does not want to cause problems for the members of her communal bank; she is happy to belong to this group where everyone works responsibly.  Gricelda plans to use the two thousand nuevos soles she is asking for to buy manure and fertilizer to make her land more productive.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Zach Powell, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":725,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":725,"image":{"id":554899,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase fertilizers for her crops","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Chanchamayo","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.05 -75.316667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-16T17:50:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":725,"lender_count":28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Gricelda ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":725,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-25T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-24T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-23T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-22T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":725}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":725,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:07Z","rounded_local_amount":2060.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201326825}],"funded_date":"2010-06-17T00:38:21Z","paid_date":"2011-04-15T11:38:07Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Zachary Powell","image":null}},{"id":212104,"name":"Umaru J.'s Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"In the photo above are members of the staff of the Kankalay Isamic Primary School Madina village.

While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling of ocean-caught fish in the local community. Julieta has been engaged in her business for more than 18 years and earns approximately 2,500 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Julieta joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Julieta has successfully repaid a previous loan of 8,000 PHP from PMPC. Jullieta is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used for fishing. This loan will be the 11th loan taken out by Julieta from PMPC. \r\n\r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

She is 35 years old. Rosalinda is the group leader of a 7-member group loan offered by ASKI. While each member of the group receives an individual loan, they are all collectively responsible for paying back the loans of their fellow group members if someone is delinquent or defaults.\r\n\r\nRosalinda is married and has 3 school-aged children. To make a living, Rosalinda owns and operates a general store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling both food and daily use products in the local community. Rosalinda has been engaged in her business for over 11 years and earns approximately 3,000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Rosalinda joined ASKI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Rosalinda is requesting a new loan of 7,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the 1st loan taken out by Rosalinda from ASKI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve\/expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout ASKI:\r\n\r\nASKI is one of the most successful microfinance institutions in the Philippines. It has 38 branches covering the Central and Northeastern areas. Its clients are mostly farmers, fisherfolks and small entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

was born in 1968; she is married to Mr. Phillip  and is the mother of seven children all above the age of 15. They are living at Elemighong, a quarter in Belo Sub Division, North West Region of Cameroon.\n\nBelta has faced major challenges in her life especially sickness and poverty. The most difficult have been the problem of raising capital for her business and paying for her children\u2019s education.  She plans to invest this loan in selling Irish potatoes and rearing goats. She will be able to raise a lot of profit from the business because it is highly demanded in her community. She believes the business will succeed because she has been in the business for a long time and so she has experience as far as the business is concerned, and she has successfully borrowed and repaid a loan one time already from GHAPE. This loan was invested in buying and selling Irish potatoes. She also thinks her approach to her customers will be captivating and hence lead to the success of her business. The loan will help her community because they will be able to afford Irish potatoes at a very low cost.\n\nBelta will plough back her profit into her business and use part to care for her family. She also will use the proceeds to pay her children's tuition fees, and save some for a rainy day. She prefers GHAPE because of the training she frequently receives and the low cost in obtaining and paying back the loan.\n\nAbout GHAPE \n\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon.  GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach.  Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values.  Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

Se\u00f1ora Maria is characterized by being kind, dedicated, and, above all, hard-working. Her work is making and selling delicious tortillas. Every morning she gets up in the early hours of the morning to prepare all the ingredients for the tortillas, so that she will have them ready when the customers ask for them. In spite of her advanced age, she does not give up. For her, it is very important to maintain her business, since in this way she contributes to the household finances, which often are not sufficient to cover all the necessities. She is very enterprising. She is always thinking of ways to make her business grow. Finally, she thought a lot about the possibility of getting a loan to invest in her tortilla shop, with the goal of having a better supply for her customers so that it would allow her to attract more customers. All this brought her to take the decision to apply for a loan at INTEGRAL to invest in the purchase of the ingredients (corn, water, lime, propane gas, etc) necessary to continue producing and offering the delicious tortillas. She does all this with the goal of improving her levels of sales and income in such a way that her quality of life and that of her family will

has been farming for 25 years and raising cattle for 30. He owns a small plot of land in Santa Lucia, Ecuador, where he cultivates rice and also has some livestock. Oswaldo and his wife Mersy have 2 children, ages 10 and 11. He hopes that with this loan he will be able to buy fertilizer for his rice, a resource he is particularly in need of. Although Oswaldo runs his farm well, he does not have a formal education and has very limited reading and writing skills. He believes his farm will continue to generate profits, especially with this loan, and he will be able to provide his children with the education he did not have the privilege of receiving himself. <\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>The Primero de Agosto Communal Bank in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Oswaldo is part of one of the newest Communal Banks in the recently developed Mifex Rural Finance Program: the Primero de Agosto Communal Bank.  All bank members are part of the Association of Rice Farmers in Santa Lucia, and they will use these microloans to prepare their lands and cultivate rice on their farms. As members of a communal bank, they are all guarantors for each other's loans. This means that if for some reason one person in the group cannot fully repay the loan, the other borrowers and the Primero de Agosto Association are responsible for the amount in default. The members of the bank also participate in a program designed to teach and encourage savings among the group. Promoting savings is often forgotten in many microfinance programs, but Mifex believes that is imperative for the communities we work with to have capital reserved for future investments or unexpected difficulties.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Below is more information about the commnity of Santa Lucia, compiled by Luis Crespo and Robert Edgar of the Mifex team when evaluating the potential of the sector for the Rural Finance Program. Special thanks to Mario Balazantegui who provided expert insight and contributed to the development of the alliances with the local organizations. <\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Economy of Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Santa Lucia County has a population of about 33,000 people. The region is fit for rice cultivating because it is not in the lowlands and therefore it is not at risk of flooding. There is also great access to water because of the Daule River, which is accessible to many of the farmers in the area. About 70% of the farmers have basic infrastructure for watering their crops. <\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rice production is the main economic activity of the area, as about 80% of the people are rice farmers. Almost everyone is either directly or indirectly involved with the rice production, as they produce, commercialize or participate in activities that add value to the product. Within the county, there is a small town also named Santa Lucia. The town is filled with many small businesses and it serves as the social and commercial hub of the area.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rice Farming in Santa Lucia<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the people in the Santa Lucia area are small farmers. They produce about 100 sacks of rice per hectare of land. In order to farm they first must prepare the lands by removing weeds and plowing. The farmers then fill an area with water to form what is known as a paddy field, because rice is a very water intensive crop. The rice seeds are either dispersed freely (the process is known as <i>boleo<\/i> in Spanish) or hand sowed. Once the rice has grown, most farmers rent machinery that helps them harvest their crop. A risk factor does exist in rice farming because of drought, but in Santa Lucia this is somewhat mitigated by the access to water form the nearby river.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Access to Credit<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest struggle in the area has been the lack of credit. Because people do not have access to formal financial services, they have turned to loan sharks for financing. They have been affected by expensive lines of credit that exceed 100% interest a year and can be as expensive as 240%. Intermediaries also exploit the farmers because of their outstanding debt. Farmers also often lack skills and knowledge of how to commercialize their product and get fair prices for their crops.  <\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Loan Use<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The loans in this sector will be used to to buy soil, seeds, fertilizer and insecticides. They will also be used to prepare the land prior to farming, to plant the seeds and purchase other materials. The loan repayment schedule is different from the typical microentrepreneur. Because farmers see the profits from their investments 5 or 6 months after making their initial expenditures, Mifex asks them to repay 50% of the capital in the first 6 months of the loan. The rest of the debt must be paid in the seventh and final month. <\/p>  "}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":19324,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy materials for rice farming","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Santa Lucia","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.183333 -80","type":"point"}},"partner_id":7,"posted_date":"2007-03-13T01:06:36Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Oswaldo","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-03-28T23:35:22Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":1200,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":9,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-04-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-05-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-06-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2007-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.43},{"due_date":"2007-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":171.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-05-07T14:03:16Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":15385},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-06-09T17:20:26Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":21958},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-07-05T20:22:34Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":29288},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-08-07T23:43:09Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":40095},{"amount":96,"local_amount":96,"processed_date":"2007-10-10T20:16:02Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":65652},{"amount":720,"local_amount":720,"processed_date":"2007-10-11T22:44:11Z","settlement_date":"2007-10-15T17:21:45Z","rounded_local_amount":720,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":66068}],"funded_date":"2007-03-14T23:35:22Z","paid_date":"2007-10-11T22:44:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":10514,"name":"Rosa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosa has a business selling fruits, such as apples, grapes, passion fruit, oranges, tree tomatoes, and others.

Its leader, Mrs. Chi T., 39, is a widowed mother who has three children. All three of them are single and attend school. She usually sells fresh fish that she buys in bulk from a wholesale supplier and then retails them for a profit in the local market.

She lives in a small rural community in Costa Rica called Cuatro de Bocas de Upala, located in the province of Alajuela.  There, they have business activities such as storekeeping, dual purpose cattle farming (meat and dairy), and agriculture.\r\n<p>\r\nRuth has been involved in dual purpose cattle farming for several years now.  She is able to sell her products to neighbors in her community, who are very satisfied with the quality of the products that she offers.\r\n<p>\r\nRuth thinks that thanks to the progress of this project, she and her family have improved, little by little, their quality of life and that she has been able to be a participant in the development of the community.  She also comments that since the beginning of the business, her self-esteem has increased greatly and now she feels very capable.\r\n<p>\r\nRight now, Ruth would like a loan of 650,000 CRC to purchase 6 male calves so that she can increase her production.  She knows that having more cows is a bigger sacrifice and will require more work.  However, her desire to have a successful small business and help her family get ahead and improve their living conditions motivates her to work with great care and dedication.\r\n<p>\r\nRuth is a member of the Empresa de Cr\u00e9dito Comunal Bansuperafe, which consists of only women.  It specializes in supporting women who are not professionals or the head of household.  It is one of EDESA\u2019s 100 partner organizations in Costa Rica.  This will be Ruth\u2019s fourth loan and with it, she hopes to continue growing on a personal and economic level, in addition to actively participating in the loan organization in her community.<br
