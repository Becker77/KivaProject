They are the driving force behind all of her efforts.\r\n\r\nHer work stall is located in the Sunday street market in the city of Juliaca.  She sells Andean products (Ca\u00f1ihua, Quinua, etc.) and is one of the few vendors of this line of products in the market.  For this reason, she has many clients and sells almost all of her merchandise, which gives her the income necessary to support her family.\r\n\r\nWhat she likes most about her job is having conversations with her clients; she is very happy and always smiling.  She's been working for three years in her currrent position and thinks that the most diffficult aspect of the job is to have to stay all day in the same stall.  In the future, she hopes to have a store where she can sell various products, including her Andean merchandise.\r\n\r\nThis is Lucila's first loan with Kiva partner MFP, and she hopes to be very punctual with her payments.  She is very well regarded within her communal bank for the order she brings to the meetings.  With the requested funds, she will purchase more Andean products, which she hopes to sell to more clients.\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Kara Gibson, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":419587,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To increase merchandise inventory","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Juliaca","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.5 -70.133333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-03T18:20:14Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucila","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-21T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-12-21T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-01-19T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-11-20T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:55:46Z","rounded_local_amount":108.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843148},{"amount":75,"local_amount":200,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-24T09:51:34Z","rounded_local_amount":217.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734726},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-02-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:05Z","rounded_local_amount":108.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959791},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-03-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:04Z","rounded_local_amount":108.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992637},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2010-04-19T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:35Z","rounded_local_amount":108.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717421}],"funded_date":"2009-11-03T21:22:47Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Kara Gibson","image":1815905}},{"id":153683,"name":"Marcializa","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Marcializa A. is from the village of Looc, Catatarman, Camiguin.

Lerio, Brgy Vito, Sagay City, Negros Occidental, where she makes a living buying and selling dried fish.  Her husband, Anthony M., is 41 years old, works as a driver and also helps in his wife in her business as time permits. They have three children who range in age from 12 to 17 years old. Virgilia joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2000 because she wanted a better life for her family. With the help of 10 previous loans, she has been lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. She now earns a monthly profit of PHP 15,000 and has applied for a new loan, for PHP 28,000, to expand her business and continue to improve her family's living conditions.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:  In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through its poverty alleviation program, NWTF is empowering women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.

Since then, she has become one of the most popular food vendors in her neighborhood. She is now 56 years old, and she is married with three children, all of whom are currently in school. She serves a wide variety of local dishes such as fufu, rice balls, banku, and ampesi, among others. Fufu is prepared from pounded cassava and plantains, and it is eaten with soup. Meanwhile, banku is prepared from milled maize grains, and it is taken with hot pepper or soup. And, ampesi is a boiled plantain or yam, and it is taken with any stew. <p>\r\n\r\nShe is now seeking a loan to buy more raw materials, including bags of maize, baskets of cassava, plantains, meats, fish, vegetables, and firewood.

She lives with her husband Ernesto, age 55, who works with their son Enzo (age 29) at the harbor. The family owns their house. For a year Ysabel has worked making necklaces, bracelets, and earrings, which she learned to make at a technical school for costume jewelery. This work is bringing her good income, along with the other small businesses she has. She owns a motor-taxi that she rents daily, makes a variety of handicrafts, and recently started selling catalog-order shoes. \r\n\r\nYsabel's desire to work and make progress motivate her dedication to her work, which continues to grow. She is always thinking of new businesses that she could start, as she doesn't want to depend only on her husband. Although having so many activities makes her tired she doesn't think it's a reason to stop working; on the contrary, she demands more of herself and is already used to the workload. \r\n\r\nIn the future, Ysabel wants to expand her businesses and earn better income. This loan will be her 15th with MFP and each loan has helped her advance her businesses. On her part, she has always been punctual and very appreciative of her fellow group members. This is her first individual loan. The money she requests will be invested in 3 of her businesses: she will buy materials to make more jewelery, increase her stock of shoes, and refurbish her motor-taxi.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Vivian Lu, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1200,"image":{"id":369537,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase investment capital.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-08-15T13:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1200,"lender_count":25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ysabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":233.3},{"due_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":249.75},{"due_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":254.92},{"due_date":"2009-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":267.41},{"due_date":"2010-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":273.83},{"due_date":"2010-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":283.73},{"due_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","amount":300.88},{"due_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":304.89},{"due_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":317.49},{"due_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":327.4},{"due_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":340.06},{"due_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":346.34}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.99},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":85.63},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":87.4},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":91.68},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":93.89},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.28},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":103.15},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":104.54},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":108.85},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":112.25},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":116.59},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":118.75}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":80.38,"local_amount":234.44,"processed_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T23:43:42Z","rounded_local_amount":235.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87081154},{"amount":85.24,"local_amount":248.61,"processed_date":"2009-10-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T03:05:48Z","rounded_local_amount":249.75,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96997305},{"amount":87.4,"local_amount":254.92,"processed_date":"2009-11-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:27Z","rounded_local_amount":256.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103842649},{"amount":344.7,"local_amount":1005.38,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-17T10:03:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1009.98,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734231},{"amount":41.3,"local_amount":120.47,"processed_date":"2010-03-12T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:49Z","rounded_local_amount":121.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992371},{"amount":104.54,"local_amount":304.89,"processed_date":"2010-04-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:17Z","rounded_local_amount":306.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717201},{"amount":108.85,"local_amount":317.49,"processed_date":"2010-05-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:25Z","rounded_local_amount":318.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144750998},{"amount":112.25,"local_amount":327.4,"processed_date":"2010-06-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:36Z","rounded_local_amount":328.89,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933641},{"amount":116.59,"local_amount":340.06,"processed_date":"2010-07-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T11:36:30Z","rounded_local_amount":341.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159672583},{"amount":118.75,"local_amount":346.34,"processed_date":"2010-08-12T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:19Z","rounded_local_amount":347.92,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166886460}],"funded_date":"2009-08-24T18:46:10Z","paid_date":"2010-09-15T10:39:19Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Vivian Lu","image":225936}},{"id":133080,"name":"Alfreda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"She believes that for poor people like her, the most precious legacy she can leave her children is the education that she strives hard to provide them in their formative years.

Besides selling fish in all its forms (fresh, smoked and dried), she also sold fruit and vegetables such as mangoes, citrus fruit, etc.  Always eager to diversify her business, Fadimata added another branch, beginning to sell food-grade ice and juice made of fruit and of artificial flavoring. She has been doing that for 7 years now and has a wide clientele from all walks of life. <P>\r\n\r\nIn view of growing her working capital so as to respond to the demand of her clientele, she turned to the loan program of the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso with whom she is on her first individual loan. This loan will be used to buy a freezer. She does her buying right there in Segou. She sells for cash and credit to a clientele composed of men and women. With this loan,  she expects to make a monthly profit of 90,000 F CFA which will allow her to fatten cattle and sheep and pay for clothing and medicine for herself and her children.  <P>\r\n\r\nHer ambition is to build a home so that they will finally not have to rent any more. \r\n\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva

Joy is 21 years old and lives in the town of Kasubi in the Kampala East region of Uganda. She is single and has two children. All of her children are currently in school. Joy has a business selling secondhand clothes, which she has had for three years.\r\n\r\nTo help expand her business, Joy is requesting a loan of 200,000 Ugandan shillings from BRAC Uganda. The loan will be used to buy more clothes. Joy plans to use the loan in order to expand her business and generate profit in order to help her children. In the future, Joy hopes to be a big businesswoman.\r\n\r\n<b>Note to lenders:<\/b> \r\nBRAC Uganda has recently begun posting a new loan product on Kiva which funds young entrepreneurs in BRAC\u2019s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program. This Kiva borrower is receiving a new ELA loan. The ELA program first provides disadvantaged adolescents, usually girls who are out of school, with livelihood training and financial literacy skills. Afterward, ELA participants can receive microfinance loans to expand their small businesses. These loans offer adolescents a unique chance to access finance at a young age and improve their prospects for the future. They target a segment of the population not typically served by traditional microfinance. Kiva is privileged to partner with BRAC Uganda in posting these new loans and giving Kiva lenders the opportunity to fund deserving young entrepreneurs and support a promising new sector in microfinance.\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":100,"image":{"id":578305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used

At midday she goes to get him, and she then continues selling while he is with her.  What she likes most about her business is that you do not lose the merchandise.

M., 51, is a single mother who has solely provided for her child's education up to college level. Vilma is a college undergraduate who runs a business buying and selling frozen meats, such as sausages, hot dogs, sweetened pork meat, etc. Every day, Vilma makes sure that she earns enough to meet her family's daily needs, including school expenses for her child. Vilma and her child live in Apilo Cruz, Pasay City.\r\n\r\nVilma buys frozen food products from manufacturers at wholesale prices and then sells these items piecemeal with a minimum markup. She also supplies balot (a fertilized duck egg with a nearly-developed embryo inside that is boiled and eaten in the shell) to balot vendors in her locality. Vilma earns an estimated monthly income of PHP 10,000.\r\n\r\nTo help her continue business operations, Vilma would like to request a PHP 50,000 loan, which she will use to buy frozen meats in bulk and to purchase food items ordered in advance by her customers. She will also use the loan to purchase trays of eggs for balot making. Vilma believes she will gain an increase in her earning capacity as a result of this loan. Vilma fervently prays for good health and successful studies for her child. She also hopes to someday establish another outlet for her business.\r\n\r\nAs a CCT community partner, Vilma faithfully attends the group's weekly fellowship* meeting where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she receives.\r\n\r\n*All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay microfinance

He said that with the profits, he plans to send his future children to school and at the same time get them to develop an interest in micro finance institutions, in particular WAGES.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":904123,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"Buy grocery products","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TG","country":"Togo","town":"Ago\u00e8","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"8 1.166667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":111,"posted_date":"2011-11-01T07:07:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Wassiou","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":150000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":11502},{"due_date":"2011-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":11675},{"due_date":"2012-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":11850},{"due_date":"2012-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":12027},{"due_date":"2012-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":12208},{"due_date":"2012-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":12391},{"due_date":"2012-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":12577},{"due_date":"2012-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":12765},{"due_date":"2012-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":12957},{"due_date":"2012-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":13151},{"due_date":"2012-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":13349},{"due_date":"2012-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":13548}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":24.92},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.3},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":25.67},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.06},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.45},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":26.85},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.25},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":27.66},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.07},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.49},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":28.93},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":29.35}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":55.75,"local_amount":25730,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:34:06Z","rounded_local_amount":26299.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250885565},{"amount":28.43,"local_amount":13120,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T12:04:18Z","rounded_local_amount":13410.51,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257295397},{"amount":23.4,"local_amount":10800,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-16T08:39:37Z","rounded_local_amount":11039.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263630595},{"amount":217.42,"local_amount":100350,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-18T08:25:15Z","rounded_local_amount":102571.97,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270663547}],"funded_date":"2011-12-07T23:35:45Z","paid_date":"2012-04-18T08:25:15Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ren\u00e9 McConnell","image":467423}},{"id":355208,"name":"Rosalyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rosalyn works in the fish industry and sells fish for a living.

Upon arriving at the Las Piedras region, they created a new Wixarika community that they called Taimarita, located 5 kilometers from Las Piedras on the western Sierra Madre.  They lived there for 10 consecutive years in the house of Pablo Taizan de la Cruz, who is the father of Micaela.  They also shared the house with other families of her siblings.<br \/><br \/>With the growth of the children and the need for them to start school, they opted to leave the community and look for a house to rent in Las Piedras.  Upon arriving in Las Piedras, they were offered the opportunity to acquire a plot of land through scheduled payments.  In this manner they were able to acquire the plot.  Currently all the children go to school.  The oldest is in the university studying industrial maintenance.  They believe that one of the primary principles of their life is to provide schooling for their children, as they hope their children's lives will be different than their own.<br \/><br \/>They still preserve their culture and traditions, and on each date on which they carry out their ceremonies, they travel to the house of Pablo Taizan to carry out the activities with all the family.  In this way they pass down to their children something they deem elemental for life in this world.  Once they have their own house, they will feel that they have something they own, and in this manner will continue fighting to make something better of their

She is 34 years old, lives with her partner and has one son, who goes to school and still depends on her. Her goal is to see her son become successful, and it motivated her to start her own business selling groceries. She runs her store out of her home, and it's a well-conditioned to serve her customers. The earnings she generates helps with the family income. She is very careful with her work and learned how to make headway. Currently, her store is in high demand from a fixed clientele who visits her daily to make their purchases because she has all the products a housewife needs, and she herself tends to the customers with the charisma she is known for. With the loan of 3,000 soles she is requesting, she plans to purchase sacks of rice and sugar, packets of noodles, various brands of canned milk and fish, eggs and personal hygiene products so she can continue providing high-quality service to her customers. Marisol feels very young and strong with her work, and day to day she feels grateful for the great opportunity to make progress as a woman. She also thanks Kiva partner Manuela Ramos for starting on the path of becoming a businesswoman.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Marty Greenstein, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1000,"image":{"id":349426,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Purchase general grocery supplies (rice, sugar, etc.)","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"San Mart\u00edn","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-10 -76","type":"point"}},"partner_id":72,"posted_date":"2009-07-10T05:40:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1000,"lender_count":30,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marisol","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-06-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":3000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":1000,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500},{"due_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.67},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-07-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:13:09Z","rounded_local_amount":507.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63206140},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-08-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T18:44:08Z","rounded_local_amount":507.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73635395},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-09-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-15T22:41:27Z","rounded_local_amount":507.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87074465},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-10-11T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T01:56:42Z","rounded_local_amount":507.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":96989808},{"amount":166.67,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:39:13Z","rounded_local_amount":507.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103834769},{"amount":166.65,"local_amount":500,"processed_date":"2009-12-11T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T15:06:25Z","rounded_local_amount":507.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110726703}],"funded_date":"2009-07-27T01:03:28Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T15:06:25Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Marty Greenstein","image":null}},{"id":124870,"name":"Godwin","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Godwin W. sells fish in Bantoma.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":475,"image":{"id":388856,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more sugar, rice, salt and other home needs for reselling","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbozi","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.75 32.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-09-16T19:50:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":475,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Perpetua ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-09-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-10-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:32:51Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97023063},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:45:01Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103868304},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-12-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:47:09Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757500},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-01-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:34:54Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118146594},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T11:16:31Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123984739},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2010-03-28T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":103233.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":129015412}],"funded_date":"2009-09-16T23:07:26Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:01:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":141319,"name":"Bebelinda","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Bebelinda C. is from the village of Lumipac.

is Belleza D., 55, resident of Pasay City, Philippines. She is married to Zalde, a driver, and mother to their own little angel. By the grace of God, Belleza has managed to support her child's schooling. At this time, she is working hard to continually send her child all the way through college.\r\n\r\nBelleza oversees operations of their tricycle transportation business. Tricycles are motorcycles with sidecars, capable of carrying at least five passengers. Due to their compact size, tricycles are favorites when travelling through the small, traffic congested streets of the communities. Income is generated either through direct earning (if the partner or the husband of the partner is the one operating the tricycle) or through payment of boundary (daily quotas, if partner lets other people drive the tricycle and they have to pay a set price, more or less like rent for the tricycle. Any excess beyond the quota will be earnings of the person who rented the tricycle). \r\n\r\nTo help her continue operation of her business, she is requesting a Php10,000 loan. She will be utilizing the loan to buy accessories and spare parts for the tricycle. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business. \r\n \r\nBelleza dreams of being able to have another business soon, preferably her own variety store. She also dreams that her child will have a quality education. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her work every week.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":250,"image":{"id":601717,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Motorcycle Transport","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"To buy accessories and spare parts for the tricycle.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Pasay City","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2010-09-20T18:20:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":250,"lender_count":10,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Belleza","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-09T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":10000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-23T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-21T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-28T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-25T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-23T08:00:00Z","amount":666.62}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.66},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":16.67}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":50,"local_amount":2000.01,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T09:52:55Z","rounded_local_amount":2210.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172089090},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:20:35Z","rounded_local_amount":2947.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177380454},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":2666.68,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-16T11:02:19Z","rounded_local_amount":2947.47,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182816790},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2666.63,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:57Z","rounded_local_amount":2947.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188652736}],"funded_date":"2010-09-20T20:42:38Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T12:42:57Z","journal_totals":{"entries":3,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Brett & Margaret Silberg","image":null}},{"id":236346,"name":"Florence","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Florence U. is from the village of Kilon-ac, Sagay, Camiguin Province.

Fundaci\u00f2n Mario Santo Domingo is a leader of this large project in order to fulfill its mission as a builder of communities.  \r\n\r\nThis is Gustavo\u2019s second Kiva loan and the tenth one he has received from Fundaci\u00f2n Mario Santo Domingo.  The new injection of operating capital will be used to buy ingredients for preparing vegetarian snacks such as barley, sesame, linseed, and whole grain flour, as well as packaging.

Esta forma de trabajo le permite generar recursos para apoyar en lo posible a su familia, pues ella es casada y tiene cuatro hijos.\n\nCuando se le consulta qu\u00e9 le gusta de Pro Mujer, ella responde que le gusta la capacitaci\u00f3n y salud.\n","en":"\r\nThe \u201cEsperanza de Pucarani\u201d communal bank will start its first cycle in Pro Mujer as part of the Santiago II Focal Center.

Among them we have production, services and commerce.\r\n\r\nIrma indicates that this is the first time she\u2019s joined a Pro Mujer communal bank having joined thanks to an invitation from one of her girlfriends.  She currently has a candy store that she\u2019s had for several years now.\r\n\r\nThe loan she\u2019ll take out now is to increase capital.  She will buy candy in La Ceja to then resell in her store.  This way of working allows her to generate income to help her family since she\u2019s married and has four children.  When asked what she likes about Pro Mujer, she answers the training and the health services.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":3500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":3500,"image":{"id":904143,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"to buy candy.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BO","country":"Bolivia","town":"La Paz  \/ El Alto","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-16.483333 -68.183333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":59,"posted_date":"2011-10-27T17:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":3500,"lender_count":107,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Irma","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Reyna Teresa\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Viviana\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Angelina\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ynes\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Raquel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Claudia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nancy Amalia\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Luciano","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Felicidad\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sabina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-10-19T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BOB","disbursal_amount":24242.4,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":3500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":4040.57},{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":4040.57},{"due_date":"2012-01-09T08:00:00Z","amount":4040.57},{"due_date":"2012-02-06T08:00:00Z","amount":4040.57},{"due_date":"2012-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":4040.57},{"due_date":"2012-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":4039.55}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":583.36},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":583.36},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":583.35},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":583.36},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":583.36},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":583.21}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":583.36,"local_amount":4040.57,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T11:08:13Z","rounded_local_amount":4060.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244650402},{"amount":583.36,"local_amount":4040.57,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:15:49Z","rounded_local_amount":4060.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250867398},{"amount":583.35,"local_amount":4040.57,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T11:44:43Z","rounded_local_amount":4060.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257277141},{"amount":583.36,"local_amount":4040.57,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:53:01Z","rounded_local_amount":4060.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263418068},{"amount":583.36,"local_amount":4040.57,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T11:04:55Z","rounded_local_amount":4060.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270132947},{"amount":583.21,"local_amount":4039.55,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T11:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":4059.15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276749766}],"funded_date":"2011-11-11T15:59:20Z","paid_date":"2012-05-15T11:14:40Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":355224,"name":"Rong","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rong (in the photo), 56, is a weaver and she also buys additional finished silk and cotton products from other weavers in her village to sell.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of microleasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the

Khalifa, 52, is married and has four children. He lives in Djabbar Rasulov district and works with his family in the agricultural industry. Many years ago he decided to begin to cultivate land that he owned. He did so to generate more income that would enable him to support his family. \r\n\r\nAt the same time Khalifa raises cattle near his house. He will use the loan money to buy young cattle to raise.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

In the future, she wants to complete construction of her house, and have more employees under her.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Mary Jane Wilkie, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":600,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":600,"image":{"id":578388,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bicycle Repair","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"Tools, tubes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"EC","country":"Ecuador","town":"Duran (Primavera)","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2 -77.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":147,"posted_date":"2010-08-04T01:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":600,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Martina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":600,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":53.74},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":54.99},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":56.63},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":57.57},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":59.19},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":61.68},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":63.55},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":67.79}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.74},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.99},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.63},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":57.57},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.19},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":60.28},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":61.68},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.55},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":64.58},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.79}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.74,"local_amount":53.74,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-15T10:14:15Z","rounded_local_amount":53.74,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166846003},{"amount":55.26,"local_amount":55.26,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-15T10:06:17Z","rounded_local_amount":55.26,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172112274},{"amount":56.36,"local_amount":56.36,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T13:56:37Z","rounded_local_amount":56.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177405684},{"amount":57.57,"local_amount":57.57,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:05:49Z","rounded_local_amount":57.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182544154},{"amount":59.19,"local_amount":59.19,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:08:25Z","rounded_local_amount":59.19,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188680909},{"amount":60.28,"local_amount":60.28,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T01:44:02Z","rounded_local_amount":60.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191379242},{"amount":61.68,"local_amount":61.68,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-15T11:23:15Z","rounded_local_amount":61.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195797226},{"amount":63.55,"local_amount":63.55,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T10:22:25Z","rounded_local_amount":63.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201239399},{"amount":64.58,"local_amount":64.58,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T10:21:43Z","rounded_local_amount":64.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206105849},{"amount":67.79,"local_amount":67.79,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-20T07:52:08Z","rounded_local_amount":67.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211862616}],"funded_date":"2010-08-04T07:50:08Z","paid_date":"2011-06-20T07:52:08Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Mary Jane Wilkie","image":null}},{"id":224070,"name":"Ishdorj","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mr. Ishdorj is 29 years old, and lives with his wife, 5 year old daughter, and 4 month old son, in his mother's house in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city.\r\n\r\nHe owns a small car, and has been running a taxi business for five years.

She is 46 years old. Daniela is married and has seven school-aged children. To make a living, Daniela owns and operates a business venture in the retail sector operating a specialized retail store. While not the only means for generating revenue, the main source of income for the business comes primarily from selling and dealing daily use products such as shampoo, soap and baby powder in the local community. Daniela has been engaged in her business for over five years and earns approximately 5000 PHP a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, Daniela joined HSPFI to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Daniela is requesting a new loan of 4000 PHP which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This loan will be the first loan taken out by Daniela from HSPFI. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve and expand her business. \r\n\r\nAbout HSPFI:\r\n\r\nHSPFI is one of accredited partners of Opportunity International in the Philippines. It is based in Cagayan de Oro City and is reaching out to the poor households of Northern Mindanao.\r\n\r\n*Note: To maximize efficiency and reduce costs, this loan was posted using a template to automate the translation by Kiva.

It was the location for the end of Alexander the Great's rule, and is known for its great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets such as Rudaki, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Firdousi, Omar Haiyam, Jomi, Mavlavi Rumi and many others. The country, with its epic mountain passes, is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language and a civilization that dates back to the fourth millennium BC. Even today, it is a complex mix of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the USSR, damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93 per cent of the country is mountainous and only 7 per cent of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands of people to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>More about IMON International<\/b><br>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low-income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She, together with her husband and children, manage the household while operating a business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for her everyday expenses.\r\n  \r\nAgnes operates a food stall. In the Philippines, the whole working community and most families only eat home-cooked meals during the evenings when all the family members are at home to take part in the meal. This is not only a usual family tradition but a matter of convenience and frugal living. It is considered a waste of time and money to spend cooking gas and food for only one to two people when buying cooked rice and viands cost less than raw food. \r\n\r\nAgnes' regular customers are her neighbors and the local community. She earns a minimum of 400 PHP in sales every day. To help her continue to operate her business, she is requesting a loan of 17,000 PHP. She will be using the loan to buy more products such as meats, rice, vegetables, condiments, seasonings, and frozen food products. She expects a boost in her business income as she expands her business.  \r\n\r\nAgnes dreams of being able to give all her children a good and high quality education through her hard work in her business. She also hopes to have her own restaurant. She faithfully meets up with her co-fellowship members to share stories of her work every week and where she can also draw strength and inspiration from the Word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay micro-finance loans.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":920963,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy raw ingredients","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Tanza, Cavite","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2011-11-21T17:40:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ma.

The distribution of farming inputs is part of One Acre Fund\u2019s integrated agriculture package, which includes training, reliable input supply (such as fertilizer and seeds), credit and insurance.\r\n\r\nWith income from her maize sales, Beatrice will educate her children and invest in livestock rearing.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the members of Sawa SHG group will each plant between \u00bd and 1 acre of maize.\r\n\r\nBeatrice is pictured with her group members.

Every weekend she goes off to look for the supplies and prepares the worn out wood and branches along with recycled paper. From this she makes a type of dough that eventually is turned into the small incense sticks which she then covers in silk paper of various colors. Thanks to her hard work she can support her small son, as she is a single mother and yearns for him to become a very useful and successful man in society. Abelinda\u2019s work routine is very active. After she makes the incense, she goes away on a trip every 15 days to the capital city of her country, where also she sells, pots during certain seasons. The items she offers for sale, she does so using a lay-away and\/or credit based process. Eighteen years ago, by advice of her beloved brother, she began selling these articles and December and October are the months which she has the most demand. Now she must take advantage of her high demand and wishes to continue doing so motivated by the gain that it brings in with the purpose of settling down in a central place to sell her products. She is requesting a loan to buy her inventory and more merchandise for this upcoming Christmas season.  Abelinda is requesting our help to fulfill each one of her plans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":93719,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Religious Articles","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Compra de insumos para la fabricaci\u00f3n de sahumerios.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2007-12-06T22:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Abelinda","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2007-12-21T00:25:41Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-01-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-03-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250},{"due_date":"2008-04-20T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2008-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-01-21T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-21T09:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":262.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":119554},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-02-21T10:15:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-21T09:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":262.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":139639},{"amount":88,"local_amount":251.43,"processed_date":"2008-03-21T10:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-21T09:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":262.9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":162777},{"amount":86,"local_amount":245.71,"processed_date":"2008-04-21T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-04-21T09:31:56Z","rounded_local_amount":256.91,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188048}],"funded_date":"2007-12-07T00:25:41Z","paid_date":"2008-04-21T09:11:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":30671,"name":"Sun","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Sun C., 22, is married and works as a housewife cooking food and looking after her little four children.

When she received her first loan of PHP 3,000, she used some of it to buy fertilizer and the balance she used to buy milled rice to resell, which enabled her to have a cash flow to pay for her weekly dues. \r\n\r\nOn her third loan, she bought a breeding sow and farmed out the piglets to her neighbors to raise, splitting the profits with them. Now she has five breeding sows and her arrangement with her neighbors has proven to be a lucrative venture for all involved. Over the years, she expanded her farming venture and her rice business continues to flourish. Inez is such a dedicated member that she has won the best member award several times. \r\n\r\nNow on her 14th loan, Inez is borrowing PHP 18,000 to buy seeds to grow on her farm.\r\n\r\nAs a single woman, Inez is working hard while she is able so that she will be financially secure and independent in her golden years.\r\n\r\nIn the picture, Inez is shown standing on the drying platform of newly harvested rice, which is usually sun-dried before it is sent to the rice mill.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\n\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation, Inc. has answered the calling of not just a few but thousands of women.

Because her children are poor, in economic terms, Lolita as a mother couldn\u2019t do anything but support them in her own little way. Unforntanely, while busying herself supporting them she lost control of her business. Despite that failure, she still feels happy that her business has helped her children and their families. Moreover, she was able to pay back the whole loan she received from ASHI for that business and now she is able to request another loan to begin a new business, which is hog\/pig fattening.\r\n\r\nFor Lolita, hog fattening is sort of like saving money in a pig. Indeed after four months of fattening, the pig will be sold (either slaughtered or alive) and by then her capital will have produced a small profit. Once she raises more pigs and sells more, her profits will be doubled along with her capital. With that, Lolita is hopeful that someday she can afford to support the higher education of her grand-children.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":275,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":275,"image":{"id":502284,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Pigs","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"To purchase pigs for fattening and selling.

He taught before that; he is a teacher by profession.  In his retirement he looked for a more tranquil job.\r\n\r\nHis job is now more intense because of the field work.  He generally invests his money in planting alfalfa and corn.  He later rents his fields to his customers, who are alfalfa merchants.   That is the way that his earnings allow him to keep supporting his family.  He also has plans to improve and expand his crops.\r\n\r\nThis is his first loan with MFP.  He pledges to be very responsible with his payments.  He is grateful to the people who made this loan possible.  It will be very useful to the progress of his business.

She runs a pharmaceutical business. She owns one small pharmaceutical kiosk and sells medications to retail clients. She launched this business eight years ago. \r\n\r\nMarhabo is seeking a loan of 7,500 TJS to purchase assorted pharmaceuticals for the cold season, when viruses, cold and flu lead to increased spending on medications. \r\n\r\nHer business is the main source of income for the family and her husband is also actively involved in the business. She is hoping to continue to develop her business one day by opening several more pharmaceutical kiosks.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore about Tajikistan and IMON International\r\n\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.

Gradually she added other merchandise according to what her customers suggested and with her first Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo loan she bought a display case giving the appearance of a sales point just like she\u2019d planned because she bought display cases and stocked them with stationery items since her main market were mothers of the children she cares for in a group home, or placement that the national government offers to women who have been previously trained, to support the nourishment and care of small children in the community so that their parents can work and the children will be well cared for, educated and fed nutritionally.  \r\n\r\nIn Marggi\u2019s case, she\u2019s been a \u201ccommunity mother\u201d for 14 years, an activity that has provided many opportunities because she\u2019s met suppliers of food to the group homes with whom she\u2019s negotiated contracts like the one she now has to supply 512 welfare homes with foods derived from wheat flour.  Because of this, aware from the beginning of this opportunity, she bought basic bakery equipment like a kneader and an oven, she hired a baker and leased a locale with many bakery tools which solved her initial problem of productive capacity which she now enjoys and through which she earns income and the opportunity of the previously mentioned contract.\r\n\r\nThis is the second financing with

From childhood he was interested in the farming business. He has worked in his farming business for 5 years and is very happy with the support of his friendly family. In his business, he gets help from his father, mother, brother and his sister.\r\n\r\nManuchehr has been advised to use agricultural supplies such as fertilizers.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n \r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n \r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

Recently, most of his clients (students) study in schools and universities, so Abdulqader's business faces a financial challenge leading to a decrease in his profit. As well, the current bad situation in Yemen also leads to his business being closed.

Sus 20 a\u00f1os de experiencia le indican cada d\u00eda lo que tiene que hacer en sus ventas, ya que su negocio lo inici\u00f3 desde el a\u00f1o 1992, cuando aprendi\u00f3 de su cu\u00f1ado la actividad comercial en la que hoy trabaja.  Con su negocio genera el sustento de su familia, conformada por su c\u00f3nyuge y sus 3 hijos, hoy en las edades de 16, 17 y 35 a\u00f1os. En su local vende principalmente de contado y trabaja de lunes a domingo en un horario extendido, desde las 7 de la ma\u00f1ana hasta las 6 de la tarde; Luis realiza sus compras de contado en f\u00e1bricas  especializadas y vende en diversas comunidades de la ciudad, adem\u00e1s del barrio donde habita y tiene su negocio.  Su meta es ampliar el surtido pues cada vez mas, crece su clientela y en \u00e9pocas como el \u00faltimo trimestre del a\u00f1o, es aun mas amplio el pedido de mercanc\u00edas, porque sus clientes compran en esta temporada, debido a que tienen dinero reunido producto de su trabajo, de bonificaciones y primas laborales y esto hace que aumente la frecuencia de sus compras varias veces a la semana. Esta es la raz\u00f3n por la cual acude a un credikiva, pues desea comprar en mayor volumen y disminuir esta frecuencia, para generar menos gastos de transporte y mejores posibilidades de obtener descuentos. Esta es justamente la raz\u00f3n de \u00e9xito al solicitar el presente credikiva, con el cual comprar\u00e1 mecedoras y sillas tejidas, productos de miscel\u00e1neas y papeler\u00eda navide\u00f1a.

","en":"Luis, 61 years old, has a general store. His main products include arts and crafts, such as rocking chairs, normal chairs, paper products, feminine products, and domestic accessories. His 20 years of experience allows him to know what he should sell every day, since his business started in 1992. He learned from an early age the activities that he now does for a living.\r\n\r\nWith his business, he sustains his family, made up of his spouse and their three kids, today of ages 16, 17, and 35 years. In his location, he principally does business in cash, and works from Monday to Sunday with a schedule that extends from 7am to 6pm. Luis makes his sales in cash for specialized fabrics and sells in various communities of the city, in addition to the neighborhood that he lives in and where he has his business. His goal is to increase his assortment of goods and his customer base more and more. In times such as the final trimester of the year, the demand for goods is even higher, because his customers buy more at this time.

He had been working there many years and his pay was very low and his family was growing. So he decided to open his own business. He began the business in March of 1987, thanks to his cousin who offered to sell his Hot Dog cart. From the very beginning, it went well, and currently Daniel has three carts. His oldest daughter is in charge of one, and he takes care of the others. He currently only sells during the weekends, as during the week he sells natural products in nearby towns. \r\n\r\nHe needs this loan for MXN 4000, which he will repay in 10 installments, to buy raw materials and disposable products so that he can continue to sell his Hot Dogs and hamburgers and in order to give better service to his customers by having all the necessary ingredients. <br

They are diverse like people themselves. Different people have different ordeals. It is believed that strong people have more difficult ordeals. However, steadfastness and hope for better always help people to live through them. Besides, there are always people around us who are there to support us in difficult moments. Those are our parents, closest relatives and friends. \r\n\r\nThe leader of this group, Nazgul, a 28-year-old young woman, deserves to be called a strong woman. The ordeal that awaited her was divorce after a few years of happy marriage. The expectations of cozy and agreeable married life did not come true. Instead, after divorce actually took place, she was left with two children to raise and uncertainty about life in the future.  Nazgul wisely viewed things in a sensible light. She talked to her parents and they agreed to help her look after her five\u2013year-old son and three\u2013year-old daughter while Nazgul is at work as a hospital nurse.  Her parents have also given her some sheep for breeding and so animal husbandry became Nazgul\u2019s second occupation. Although she only earns about $95 per month, she can always sell some of her cattle to satisfy her family's needs.  Nazgul wants to increase the total population of her cattle and is therefore requesting a loan to buy a calf. <p>\r\n\r\nThere are three partners in Nazgul\u2019s group:<p>\r\n\r\nAsigul, 60, has raised four children and is married to a vice principal of music college. Asigul is a housewife who keeps some cattle and needs a loan to buy a cow.<p>\r\n\r\nBurulbu, 59, has one son, a boxing trainer. and a retired husband.  For a living, Burulbu raises livestock and sells milk. She hopes to obtain a loan to buy a cow. <p>\r\n\r\nKuljamal, 56, a mother of five children, is married to a shepherd. Kuljamal stays at home and looks after cattle and sells milk. She has applied for this loan to buy a milk cow. <p>\r\n\r\n--- Where Did This Loan Come From? ---\r\nThis loan is brought to you by Mol Bulak Finance, a young and ambitious socially-focused MFI in Kyrgyzstan.\r\n\r\nMol Bulak Finance is strongly committed to the principles of sustainable development on the basis of 3-Ps concept - People (building human capital and taking care of its customers and the society as well), Profit (to be profitable to grow further) and the Planet (taking care of the environment).

Thus he has many customers who even make a purchase of his products straight from his house.\r\n\r\nToday Rahmatullo has great demand for his goods and that is why he wants to take an individual loan. He has requested a loan of 13,000 Somoni to add to his working capital to allow him to purchase more inventory.\r\n\r\nRahmatullo is ready to work even harder, make sacrifices, and push every once in a while to achieve his goal and become a successful entrepreneur.\r\n\r\nIMON International believes his perseverance and clear vision will become key success factors in his small business.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>More about Tajikistan and IMON International<\/b>\r\nTajikistan is known for its rich history, which includes a key post along the Silk Road and the end of Alexander the Great's rule. It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium B.C. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\r\n\r\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\r\n\r\n<b>IMON's History<\/b>\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.
