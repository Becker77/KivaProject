fabricaci\u00f3n de productos alimenticios como deditos, empanaditas, arepas y pastelitos de queso, carne , o pollo, a los que imprime el sabor de la comida de su natal Cartagena,  ha logrado sostener   su hogar; Ana  lleg\u00f3 de su tierra desde sus 7 a\u00f1os a Barranquilla, ciudad capital,  donde hizo estudios primarios, contrajo matrimonio, tuvo 8 hijos y finalmente se separ\u00f3 de su esposo  e inici\u00f3 su propio negocio, que  al principio   fue la  preparaci\u00f3n de fritos en su propia casa, actividad que  cambi\u00f3 por la de panader\u00eda , con la que se posicion\u00f3 por muchos a\u00f1os en el mercado y construy\u00f3 su legado familiar en este oficio, pues  todos sus hijos en las edades de 25 a 38 a\u00f1os tienen su propia microempresa en panader\u00eda, o en preparaci\u00f3n de productos derivados de la harina de trigo. \nHoy  su principal actividad es la fabricaci\u00f3n de deditos, pastelitos, empanaditas de queso, pollo o carne, los cuales distribuye en los colegios de los barrios aleda\u00f1os a su vivienda y en tiendas donde es muy reconocida. Su meta principal es diversificar sus productos y la apertura de nuevos y permanentes mercados y este es justamente su gran desaf\u00edo.  En la actualidad est\u00e1 aplicando a su primer financiamiento con la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo,  mediante la l\u00ednea credikiva, ya que su capital de trabajo es muy peque\u00f1o y quiere fortalecerlo comprando, materias primas de contado para obtener descuentos por el volumen de compra, especialmente Harina de trigo, y az\u00facar, que aumentan sus precios permanentemente.

She makes food products like deditos (a type of fried snack); empanaditas (little turnovers); corn cakes; and cheese, meat, or chicken pies.  She makes them with the flavor of food in her native Cartagena.  She has managed to support her household.\r\n\r\nAna left her land and arrived in Barranquilla, the capital city, seven years ago.  She attended elementary school, got married, and had eight children.  She eventually separated from her husband and started her own business.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning she made fried food in her own house.  She traded that activity for a bakery, which has been located in the market for many years.  She built her family legacy through this occupation.  All of her children, ages 25-38, have their own small bakery businesses or make products derived from wheat flour.\r\n\r\nNow she primarily makes deditos; corn cakes; cheese, meat, or chicken empanaditas; and cheese, meat, or chicken pies.  She distributes them to the schools in the neighborhoods surrounding her house.  She also delivers to stores where she is very well-known.\r\n\r\nHer main goal is to diversify her products and to open new and permanent markets.  This is precisely her great challenge.\r\n\r\nShe is currently applying for her first loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo through Kiva.  She has very little work capital, and she wants to strengthen it by purchasing raw materials for cash.  She will do this to get volume discounts, especially for wheat flour and sugar.  These prices are constantly rising.\r\n\r\nAna\u2019s business now has a turnover on accounts receivable of 1.3 days, a 5 day turnover of inventory, and its turnover for accounts payable is 2.5 days.  Her debt with the new Kiva loan is 11.2%.\r\n\r\nAna is a great mother who has always supported her children.  Now, they support her as well.  Therefore, her dream is to see them become successful and have their own homes.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":425,"image":{"id":712556,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy a greater quantity of wheat flour and sugar","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-02-17T00:10:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":425,"lender_count":17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ana Isabel","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-02-16T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":73340},{"due_date":"2011-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":74745},{"due_date":"2011-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":76178},{"due_date":"2011-06-16T07:00:00Z","amount":77638},{"due_date":"2011-07-16T07:00:00Z","amount":79126},{"due_date":"2011-08-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80643},{"due_date":"2011-09-16T07:00:00Z","amount":82188},{"due_date":"2011-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":83764},{"due_date":"2011-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":85369},{"due_date":"2011-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":87009}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.96},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.71},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40.47},{"due_date":"2011-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.24},{"due_date":"2011-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.04},{"due_date":"2011-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":42.84},{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.66},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.5},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.36},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":46.22}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38.96,"local_amount":73340,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-15T11:08:36Z","rounded_local_amount":73517.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201289276},{"amount":39.71,"local_amount":74745,"processed_date":"2011-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-05-15T11:04:20Z","rounded_local_amount":74925.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":206157413},{"amount":40.47,"local_amount":76178,"processed_date":"2011-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-06-15T11:18:37Z","rounded_local_amount":76362.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":211230424},{"amount":41.24,"local_amount":77638,"processed_date":"2011-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-07-15T11:09:26Z","rounded_local_amount":77825.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":216509287},{"amount":42.04,"local_amount":79126,"processed_date":"2011-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-08-15T08:49:55Z","rounded_local_amount":79317.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":221673505},{"amount":42.84,"local_amount":80643,"processed_date":"2011-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-09-17T08:02:25Z","rounded_local_amount":80837.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":227320062},{"amount":179.74,"local_amount":338330,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:32Z","rounded_local_amount":339147.28,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803203}],"funded_date":"2011-02-17T04:34:18Z","paid_date":"2011-10-15T09:06:32Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":277763,"name":"Manuela De Jesus","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Do\u00f1a Manuela, tiene 57 a\u00f1os de edad, reside en El Transito departamento de San Miguel, vive con su madre y dos hermanas.

For over six years, she has been selling mazamorras -- a typical dessert in her area (a sweet corn-based pudding). She currently sells them from morning till night from a vending post that she has installed four years ago.

He owns a parcel of land on which he grows nopal.  Ismael is requesting a loan to buy compost for fertilizing his crop of nopal so that he can produce more to sell.  He also grows corn.  Ismael started his business three years ago.  His father taught him how to work in the fields and grow nopal and corn.  Ismael also raises sheep.  His business is important because it enables him to get ahead and feed his family.  The part he enjoys most is harvesting and selling the nopal.  This type of business is recognized internationally because the nopal is known for its flavor and medicinal properties.  His main challenge is dealing with the weather during the harvest season.  If there is hail, the impact from the hail will leave marks and cuts on the nopal leaves.  \r\n<p>\r\nHis hopes and dreams include increasing his nopal harvest, adding more rooms to his house, growing his sheep business, and seeing that his daughter grows up healthy and lacks nothing in her education.  San Andr\u00e9s Cuauhtempan is a beautiful town and Ismael was born there.  It receives all services and has a mild climate.  The crops that are grown there include corn, nopal, beans, and both red and green tomatoes.   \r\n<p>\r\nThe members of this group would like to say to Kiva and Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad, \u201cThank you for supporting and trusting us with this loan.  We appreciate the continued support each day and plan to succeed in submitting our payments.\u201d\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":775,"image":{"id":784800,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"to purchase compost for fertilizing a crop of \"nopal\".

a la venta en volumen de hielo y boli; negocio que surgi\u00f3 justamente observ\u00f3 la gran demanda de los habitantes de este municipio, que posee  vocaci\u00f3n tur\u00edstica, por estar ubicado a la orilla del mar y provisto de playas, que albergan a su alrededor negocios como restaurantes y muchos vendedores ambulantes y que por su c\u00e1lido clima, sus habitantes y turistas buscan refrescarse continuamente para calmar su sed, especialmente en los meses de verano, \u00e9poca en la cual se impactan mayormente este tipo de ventas. Sus principales clientes son los vendedores al detalle que no tienen neveras y suelen enfriar sus refrescos con hielo y le siguen en su estructura de compradores los restaurantes. Como Yolima es una joven consciente de la oportunidad, tambi\u00e9n vende mercanc\u00edas variadas, como blusas, zapatos, pantalones y accesorios femeninos que compra en la ciudad de Barranquilla y los distribuye entre sus clientes en el municipio mediante plazos de pago adaptados a sus necesidades, facilitando que sus clientes puedan acceder a las mercanc\u00edas que necesitan, para pagar en varias partidas. Su capital de trabajo no es suficiente para hacer crecer ambos negocios, el primero ya requiere un congelador y el segundo exige responder a su creciente clientela que solicitan mercanc\u00edas variadas a Yolima y es muy dif\u00edcil ser oportuna. Esta es la raz\u00f3n de aplicar a su credikiva, primer financiamiento que hace a la Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo, con la cual comprar\u00e1 un congelador y ropa femenina y accesorios femeninos. Porque su sue\u00f1o y gran desaf\u00edo es crecer, hasta convertirse en la mayor distribuidora de su municipio. Mientras esto ocurre, Yolima trabaja persistentemente en su negocio con un margen de contribuci\u00f3n del 80% y con sus inventarios rotando cada 3 d\u00edas.\n\n","en":"Yolima is 29 years old and lives in the town of Puerto Colombia with her husband.  She sells ice in bulk and \"boli\" (flavored water in small plastic bags).  This business came about as she observed great demand by the inhabitants of this municipality.  The area has tourist potential, being located by the sea and beaches.  It is also home to businesses such as restaurants and many vendors.  The area is also known for its warm climate, so inhabitants and tourists alike continually seek to cool off and quench their thirst, especially in the summer months,which is a major impact on sales.  Yolima's main customers are vendors who do not have refrigerators and often cool their drinks with ice for restaurants to purchase.\r\n\r\nAs Yolima is a young woman who is aware of opportunity, she also sells general merchandise such as shirts, shoes, pants and accessories for women. She buys the items in the city of Barranquilla and distributes them to her customers in the municipality by payment terms tailored to their needs.  She enables her customers to access the goods they need by allowing them to pay in several payments.  Her working capital is not enough to grow both businesses; the first requires a freezer and the second requires responding to her growing clientele seeking a variety of goods, and it is very difficult for Yolima to be timely. \r\n\r\nThis is the reason why Yolima is applying for a loan with Kiva and this is her first financing with Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo.  She plans to buy a freezer and women's clothing accessories.  Her dream and challenge is to grow and become the largest distributor in her municipality.  Until this happens, Yolima will work persistently in her business with a contribution margin of 80% and inventories rotating every 3 days.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":350,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":350,"image":{"id":1081713,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a freezer and women's clothing and accessories.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Puerto Colombia\/departamento del Atl\u00e0ntico","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2011-08-19T20:40:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":350,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yolima","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-07-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":600000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":350,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-09-04T07:00:00Z","amount":52705},{"due_date":"2011-10-04T07:00:00Z","amount":56015},{"due_date":"2011-11-04T07:00:00Z","amount":57089},{"due_date":"2011-12-04T08:00:00Z","amount":58183},{"due_date":"2012-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":59298},{"due_date":"2012-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":60435},{"due_date":"2012-03-04T08:00:00Z","amount":61593},{"due_date":"2012-04-04T07:00:00Z","amount":62774},{"due_date":"2012-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":63977},{"due_date":"2012-06-04T07:00:00Z","amount":67931}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":30.74},{"due_date":"2011-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.68},{"due_date":"2012-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.3},{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":33.94},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":34.59},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.26},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.93},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.61},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.32},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":39.63}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":63.42,"local_amount":108720,"processed_date":"2011-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-10-15T09:05:21Z","rounded_local_amount":113648.64,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":232803737},{"amount":33.3,"local_amount":57089,"processed_date":"2011-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-12-15T09:58:50Z","rounded_local_amount":59677.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":244568766},{"amount":33.94,"local_amount":58183,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T10:07:00Z","rounded_local_amount":60820.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250780091},{"amount":34.59,"local_amount":59298,"processed_date":"2012-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-02-15T10:20:59Z","rounded_local_amount":61986.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":257188485},{"amount":35.26,"local_amount":60435,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T09:35:10Z","rounded_local_amount":63174.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263324703},{"amount":149.49,"local_amount":256275,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:33Z","rounded_local_amount":267892.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270038762}],"funded_date":"2011-08-25T00:49:05Z","paid_date":"2012-04-15T09:31:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Angela Yeh","image":827898}},{"id":331044,"name":"Samuel","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Samuel is a determined business man aged 37 years.

There is a good deal of competition for both things, but her clientele is so well established that she is at an advantage. Since she is so well known, she is recommended by her neighbors, who also are frequent clients themselves. She is always looking for new clients, too, for both of her businesses.

At 54, she's managed to get her own house but there are still a lot of things she wants.  For Ceferina, her son, Cristian, 11, has become the focus of all her efforts.  With her bag of cosmetics in hand, she goes out every day to convince her customers to buy a cream or some item of make-up from her.  Ceferina is very persuasive and it's not surprising that she's one of the top saleswomen.  She's operated the business for 3 years.  What she likes most is talking to customers and telling them about new products.  In the future, she would like to set up her own cosmetics shop becuase she's found it difficult to see all of her customers during every month.  Ceferina works tirelessly, month after month, with the single-minded goal of making a better life for her beloved son, Cristian.  This is Ceferina's first MFP loan and she's very happy to get it.  She's worked hard at her community bank to get this loan and doesn't want to miss a single installment.  She will use the loan to buy more cosmetics, investing the total amount in adding merchandise so that she has the stock she needs.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":269960,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Add merchandise.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Puno","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-15.833333 -70.033333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-02-13T21:10:07Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Ceferina","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-03T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-05-04T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":117},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":115}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.61},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.95}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":37.61,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2009-03-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T20:32:45Z","rounded_local_amount":121.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27117045},{"amount":37.6,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2009-04-06T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T21:42:32Z","rounded_local_amount":121.77,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36011958},{"amount":2.66,"local_amount":8.28,"processed_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T01:01:04Z","rounded_local_amount":8.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44595544},{"amount":72.55,"local_amount":225.72,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:37:21Z","rounded_local_amount":234.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989805},{"amount":37.63,"local_amount":117,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T16:39:04Z","rounded_local_amount":121.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63210941},{"amount":36.95,"local_amount":115,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:51Z","rounded_local_amount":119.7,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73640446}],"funded_date":"2009-02-14T00:55:20Z","paid_date":"2009-09-15T19:17:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":92554,"name":"Evelyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. B. was recognized as a Paglaum member on 29 May 2007 and is a resident of Barangay Guinabut.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, so they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that is allows clients to use their equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":300,"image":{"id":320428,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","themes":null,"use":"To purchase clothes in bulk for her business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mbeya","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-8.9 33.45","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-05-16T20:50:08Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":300,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tusajigwe ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-05-31T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":400000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":300,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","amount":400000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":300}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":300,"local_amount":400000,"processed_date":"2010-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","rounded_local_amount":402450,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144773310}],"funded_date":"2009-05-16T22:38:37Z","paid_date":"2010-12-10T13:05:58Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Diane Bird","image":220084}},{"id":113034,"name":"Audelys Isabel","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Audelys Isabel M.

Until recently she worked as a housekeeper in another remote town to support her family, causing her to neglect her two small children. Five months ago she decided to start her own business and begin selling typical local snacks and chicken. Unfortunately, the trip from home to Acatl\u00e0n de P\u00e9rez Figueroa to buy live chickens to bring back home to sell is very expensive.  Because of this, she is requesting a loan.  She wants to start a small farm to save on travel expenses, be more devoted to her children, ensure they get an education, and prepare them for a better future.  With the loan, Dolores will buy live chickens, water troughs, and feed.  For these same reasons, Dolores has joined La L. Group to apply for a loan from the Fundaci\u00f3n Realidad A.C.

She currently lives alone with them, since her husband Roberto is working in another city in the field of agriculture.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, due to the circumstances of her life, Martha began selling charcoal in a market near her home. At first, the work was intermittent; she substituted for a woman who would leave the shop in her care. Over time, it became her permanent job, allowing her to help her husband with the household costs and other personal expenses. \r\n\r\nMartha enjoys running her shop, because she has no competition and it is profitable. In her own words, \"if she hadn't left it, I still would have continued, because it brought me plenty of income.\" \r\n\r\nMartha is able to run her business at the market and return home in the evening to see her daughters. She does not get tired, because she is an extremely hardworking woman with a strong desire to get ahead. She hopes someday to expand her business and sell charcoal wholesale in a large facility; thanks to her entrepreneurial spirit, she can already picture this in her mind. \r\n\r\nThis is Martha's fourth loan with MFP, and she is completely confident that she will repay it punctually, because she knows that she will have other loans in the future that will permit her to enhance her business. With the funds she is requesting, she will improve the infrastructure of the shop she currently operates, since it has deteriorated somewhat. She will begin by repairing the floor, so that her charcoal shop will project a better image to customers. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Patricia Linderman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":420788,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Charcoal Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Renovating her charcoal shop","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-07T13:40:13Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Martha","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":211.24},{"due_date":"2009-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":223.81},{"due_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":231.48},{"due_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","amount":242.25},{"due_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","amount":258.52},{"due_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","amount":265.55},{"due_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","amount":278.77},{"due_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":288.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.93},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.34},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":81.02},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":84.78},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.49},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":92.94},{"due_date":"2010-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":97.57},{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":100.93}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":73.93,"local_amount":211.24,"processed_date":"2009-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:56:16Z","rounded_local_amount":214.41,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843158},{"amount":152.27,"local_amount":435.05,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:05:52Z","rounded_local_amount":441.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734739},{"amount":7.09,"local_amount":20.24,"processed_date":"2010-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:10:40Z","rounded_local_amount":20.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118124098},{"amount":84.78,"local_amount":242.25,"processed_date":"2010-02-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:49:19Z","rounded_local_amount":245.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959804},{"amount":90.49,"local_amount":258.52,"processed_date":"2010-03-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:33:14Z","rounded_local_amount":262.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992649},{"amount":92.94,"local_amount":265.55,"processed_date":"2010-04-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:58Z","rounded_local_amount":269.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717434},{"amount":97.57,"local_amount":278.77,"processed_date":"2010-05-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-06-15T09:39:42Z","rounded_local_amount":282.95,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":144751186},{"amount":100.93,"local_amount":288.38,"processed_date":"2010-06-26T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:51Z","rounded_local_amount":292.71,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151933741}],"funded_date":"2009-11-07T19:48:43Z","paid_date":"2010-07-15T10:02:51Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Patricia Linderman","image":100107}},{"id":154172,"name":"Vicente","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vicente G. is 50 years old and resides in Barangay Estefania Amulung, Cagayan.

She earns her living by operating three business ventures:  buying & selling dried fish, operating a sari-sari store and a farming business. Her husband Ernesto, who is 67 years old, works as a farmer to earn his living and helps in his wife's business activities. They have five children who are between 21 and 37 years old. Rosita joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2001 because she aspired for something better for her family. With the help of her past 13 loans from NWTF-Project Dungganon, Rosita has been incrementally lifting her family out of poverty by the sweat of her brow. Her previous loan of PHP 16,000 helped her earn a monthly profit of PHP 3,500, uplifting the family's standard of living.  This time, for her 14th loan, she is borrowing PHP 15,000 to use as additional capital for her business so that she can continue to save up for future family needs. Rosita is a Dungganon woman who is following an honorable path toward the achievement of her dreams. \r\n\r\nAbout NWTF: In a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF) is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress from earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams.

She has endeavored in many ways to provide for her family but found that she has a real gift for knitting so she has decided to dedicate more time to it and to perfect her craft.  For a long time she only made sweaters and caps for special order but she has now expanded her product line and offers a full range of woolen garments to the public.  Her products have been very well received and Clotilde has decided to open a small workshop where customers can come and see the work and place orders.  Her dream is to buy another knitting machine and expand her shop, growing it in a short time into a small factory.  She is asking for a loan of $350 and promises to repay the sum in 6 months.

Do\u00f1a Claudia desea poder darle a sus dos hijos una carrera y por eso se sacrifica horas de horas en su trabajo en sus tierras, produciendo frutas c\u00edtricas, pl\u00e1tanos y caf\u00e9. Esto le sirve para obtener ingresos e invertirlos en la educaci\u00f3n de sus hijos. Para ella este trabajo no es muy cansado, pero s\u00ed, muy costoso, por los abonos y  por el mantenimiento que tiene que dar a sus terrenos, sobre todo en la compra de plantas y semillas para aumentar su producci\u00f3n. Para esto que se solicita este pr\u00e9stamo, en espera que usted pueda ayudarla y as\u00ed conseguir que sus hijos sean profesionales."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":178976,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Purchase supplies and seeds for her crops, in order to earn enough to pay university tuition for her two youngest children.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2008-07-13T02:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":225,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Claudia Simona","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-07-27T06:37:45Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":600,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-08-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-09-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-10-26T07:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100},{"due_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","amount":100}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-10-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2008-12-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-01-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":37.5},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":37.5}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":38,"local_amount":101.33,"processed_date":"2008-08-27T09:00:01Z","settlement_date":"2008-08-29T01:59:10Z","rounded_local_amount":109.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":308472},{"amount":38,"local_amount":101.33,"processed_date":"2008-09-27T09:00:02Z","settlement_date":"2008-09-28T07:54:28Z","rounded_local_amount":109.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339601},{"amount":74,"local_amount":197.34,"processed_date":"2008-11-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2008-12-17T00:17:47Z","rounded_local_amount":213.87,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":5335296},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2008-12-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T01:29:05Z","rounded_local_amount":108.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9956474},{"amount":37.5,"local_amount":100,"processed_date":"2009-01-26T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T14:11:50Z","rounded_local_amount":108.36,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":10226731}],"funded_date":"2008-07-13T06:37:45Z","paid_date":"2009-02-15T14:11:50Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":null},{"id":59783,"name":"Tatyana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Tatyana is married with grown kids.

Due to her marital separation and in order to support the needs of her daughter, she launched a business selling food, and it has been going well so far.  One of the reasons for her success is that she does not need to rent a location because she has converted her house into a pension, where she offers a daily menu to a group of airline workers since her house is close to the airport.  To add to her income, she sells salchipollos (a dish with chicken and fries) at night.  She has had this business for 10 years and has enjoyed it a lot because she feels useful and above all, she constantly interacts with many people.  In the future, she hopes to have a very nice restaurant where she can welcome many dinner guests.  This is her fourth loan with Kiva partner MFP and it has been two years since she found out about the institution and of the communal bank methodology.

The profits will be used to make loan interest payments, to provide for family needs, and to invest the rest in business.  \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Dan Kuey, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1025,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1025,"image":{"id":301172,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To buy fish and to strengthen their catering business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SN","country":"Senegal","town":"THIES","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"14.783333 -16.966667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":108,"posted_date":"2009-04-09T22:50:12Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1025,"lender_count":32,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Aly","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maymouna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sokhna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Dior","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Fatou","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-04-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":1025,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","amount":62500},{"due_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","amount":62500}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.12},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":128.16}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-05-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-15T19:43:36Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44636069},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-06-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T04:26:04Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53037979},{"amount":128.13,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-07-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T20:49:18Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63262083},{"amount":128.09,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-08-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T23:37:33Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73703067},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-09-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T05:01:36Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87132653},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-10-03T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T08:27:43Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97046922},{"amount":128.12,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-11-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T15:18:00Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103892471},{"amount":128.16,"local_amount":62500,"processed_date":"2009-12-03T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T17:57:29Z","rounded_local_amount":63458.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110780979}],"funded_date":"2009-04-14T03:11:57Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T17:57:29Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Daniel Kuey","image":669418}},{"id":104858,"name":"Flor De Maria","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Flor es socia del Banco Comunal Renacer.\nFlor es casada, tiene 42 a\u00f1os y 4 hijos, Flor junto a su esposo viajan a las ferias D. la regi\u00f3n en donD. compra ganado y luego los comercializa en la feria D.

S. is married and has six children. Her hometown is Belo, Cameroon where she sells koki beans and palm oil in the Mejang Market. Prodensia purchases these items in bulk and sells them at retail prices. With this loan she plans to purchase koki beans, three tins of palm oil, a bag of groundnuts (peanuts) along with her transport costs.\r\n<p>\r\nProdensia knows her resale business will do well. She knows that \"people need koki bean to prepare they things with.\" Koki beans are commonly used to prepare local dishes in Cameroon. A particular favorite, which is often sold on the street, is a deep-fried, Madeline-shaped finger food. It can be served with Pepe (hot pepper) sauce. The tins of palm oil she plans to purchase are more like large barrels and the palm oil is a deep red-orange color.\r\n<p>\r\nProdencia has faced sickness and death in her family and notes that she \"hates stealing.\" With the profits from this loan Prodensia plans to buy seeds, yams and koki beans for her farm. Most families have a farm in Cameroon. A lot of times, too, the farm is a small or long walk from your compound.\r\n<p>\r\nThis is Prodensia's second loan from GHAPE since she became a member in early 2008. She takes out GHAPE loans because the loan conditions are preferable.\r\n<p>\r\nAbout GHAPE\r\nThe Grounded and Holistic Approach to People's Empowerment (GHAPE) is a non-profit NGO based in Bamenda, Cameroon. GHAPE works towards the empowerment of the poor and poverty alleviation through a highly multi-faceted approach. Every client is trained in business management, basic health, life skills, financial management, profits and losses, and family values. Clients are also required to contribute a small amount into a personal savings account; most clients save much more than the minimum requirement.

In the beginning, he was working very long hours, and the pay wasn't enough to justify keeping him away from his family for so long - in fact, he says, it wasn't even enough to support his family. That's when he had the idea to import handmade crafts from his home country and sell them in Miami. Pedro says that the accessories he imports were not well-known in Miami before he started importing them, but he has been successful in selling them. His wife chooses the inventory and gets the best deal possible, and he sells it to responsible distributors in Miami and other metro areas such as NY, LA, Houston, and Atlanta.<P>\r\n\r\nPedro will use this loan to increase his inventory, and he says that clients have requested more products that he does not have at the moment. He says the loan will also help him increase his inventory in preparation for increased demand during the holiday season. In the future, he hopes to start importing items from other countries, such as Peru and Mexico, directly from the local craftsmen and women who make them.<P>\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\nAbout U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA<P>\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated 10 million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis.\u201d Microfinance institutions like ACCION USA support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education. <P>\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since

Ana is requesting a new loan of 9,500 PHP which will be used to purchase livestock feed & other supplies. This will be the 2nd loan taken out by Ana from PMPC.

Many people these days are refrained by daily routine and daily needs and do not have high objectives toward which they would aspire. This is not the case with the heroes of our story. They represent the middle\u2013income or even lower middle\u2013income class and do not seem to be distinguished from other people except that they all have high objectives and the determination to achieve them.\r\n<p>\r\nAsylkan Y. is the group leader. She is a widow and lives with her son (16 years), grandson and daughter-in-law. Asylkan works as an accountant and also raises cattle. Two and half years ago, she bought a cow and since then she has been trying to increase the population of her livestock. \r\n<p>\r\nNow her accountant's salary is a little over 80 USD a month. She would like to have income from selling milk and trading in cattle during weekends at a cattle market. She has decided to apply for a loan to buy two lambs, pay a shepherd for grazing, and buy forage for them. In the future she hopes to buy a car for her son and furniture for her home.\r\n<p>\r\nGulzaira T., 49, is a widow. Her son works in a resort and earns a salary of 185 USD. Gulzaira does odd jobs in some factory. She hopes to obtain this loan to buy a big carpet and some clothes.\r\n<p>\r\nAnarkul A., 41, is single. She keeps some cattle at her parent\u2019s and works as a laborer in \u201cPAT\u201d factory. With her loan she hopes to help her sister prepare the dowry of her daughter.\r\n<p>\r\nApal C., 48, is a widow. Her son works as a baker and has a salary of 95 USD.

Her greatest wish is to buy another vehicle, and she is saving up for it. This is her fourth loan with MFP, and she will be punctual with repayments. She is grateful to those who support her loan, and knows it will be very useful in the growth of her business. With the requested loan, she will invest in the purchase of replacement parts for the maintenance of her vehicle.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":700,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":700,"image":{"id":546455,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","themes":null,"use":"Replacement parts for vehicle maintenance","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2010-06-01T19:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":700,"lender_count":16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Zenaida ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-05-13T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":10,"loan_amount":700,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-07-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-08-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-13T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":700}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":700,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:02Z","rounded_local_amount":2011.8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191462938}],"funded_date":"2010-06-07T03:38:19Z","paid_date":"2011-02-16T04:41:02Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":208136,"name":"Sarah","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Sarah is married with seven children, all of them in school, and also looks after her granddaughter.

She also lives with their two children, ages 11 and 8.\r\n\r\nSince her husband's salary is very low, Dinora decided eight years ago to open her own business, which allows her to contribute to all the household expenses along with her husband.  This is why she invested her savings in a perishable goods store, which was born from her initiative to have more economic stability.  Dinora is asking for a loan so she can invest more in her store, buying products like sausages, detergents, bread and other products.  She hopes to do this with the loan, since although she has had the shop for several years she has not had the money to invest in it because most of her earnings go toward household expenses.<br

In a plan to improve her profit margin, Yokunda has decided to add some items in her shop that her competitors do not have. She also plans to open another shop on the next street. These new strategies require additional capital. From her own savings, Yokunda cannot finance her business plan. She is in need of an additional USD 1000 to implement her plan.

Yalcou\u00e9, age 40, lives in a polygamous family with her husband, co-wives, and seven children (four boys and three girls) in Banconi, one of the outlying districts of the city of Sikasso (third administrative region of the Republic of Mali).  After having tried several kinds of work without success, she opted to become initiated eight years ago in the commerce of 'Wax' pagnes (highly prized cloth in West Africa), embroidered fabrics, bedsheets, and 'Super'  basins.  She works at the marketplace of her district in Sikasso where she is in high demand by her customers, thanks to the quality of her goods. \r\n\r\nTo satisfy her burgeoning customer base, she decided to join the micro-finance institution Soro Yiriwaso five years ago.  After five solidarity loans (group loans) with a women's association of her district (Association Benkadi de Banconi), she is now on her fourth individual loan.  All of the preceding loans have been correctly repaid. \r\n\r\nShe intends to use this loan to buy:  10 lengths of 'Wax' pagnes, 10 sets of embroidered fabrics, 10 sets of sheets, and 10 sets of 'Super' basins.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. <P>\r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. <P>\r\n\r\nIMON's History<P>\r\n\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

This is 48-year-old Farida O. from Mwanza. She is divorced, with three children between the ages of 14 and 19 years old.\n\nFarida has been running a soda business since 2007. It is said that Pepsi is one of the most recognized symbols in the world, and it\u2019s true. Even in the most remote villages in Africa, there is usually some kind of shop selling Coke, Fanta, and Guinness. The hot weather makes soft drinks all the more appealing - a very cheap marketing tool! All of which explains why selling soft drinks is such a popular venture.\n\nFarida works at the business for twelve hours per day, six days per week and currently earns about 150 USD from her business. She is requesting a loan of 325 USD in order to purchase more soda to sell to her customers. In the future, she plans to expand her business. Farida thanks you for your support!\n\n\nAbout SELFINA: \nSELFINA has taken a lead role as a pioneer of micro-credit in Tanzania through Micro-Leasing. The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility.\n\nCustoms and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":350596,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Soft

Teodosia has been engaged in her business for more than five years and earns approximately 1,500 Philippine pesos (about $32) a month for these activities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Teodosia joined PMPC to gain access to financial services to help improve her living situation and ability to engage in business activities. Teodosia has successfully repaid a previous loan of 14,000 PHP from PMPC. Teodosia is requesting a new loan of 10,000 PHP, which will be used to purchase additional products to sell. This will be the eighth loan taken out by Teodosia from PMPC. She plans to use the additional revenue generated from the business to improve the general living conditions of her family. \r\n\r\nAbout PMPC:\r\n\r\nPaglaum Multi-Purpose Cooperative (PMPC) is one of the most progressive cooperatives in northwestern Mindanao.

This business yields her about seven hundred som ($15) per month.  She is the leader of this group.  Begaim spent most of her life living in a rural area and involved in agriculture.  After her marriage, her parents left her two cows to start her own household.  Twenty-seven years have passed since then.  Begaim became a mother herself and had five children.  Two daughters already got married and live separately.  The son (he is twenty-four) also became involved in agriculture and actively helps Begaim take care of livestock.  One other son (he is fifteen years old) is in eighth grade, and the youngest son is in second grade.  Begaim\u2019s husband always takes care of the household side-by-side with Begaim and helps his wife raise the children, and, together with his son, tries to constantly increase livestock headcount.  Their income does not only come from the sale of eggs, but also from sale of milk and reaches up to two thousand som ($40) per month.  Daily duties do not tire Begaim at all.  On the contrary, she is eager to keep more livestock and increase her family income.  And life gets more expensive every day and makes it necessary to make some hard decisions and push forward.  Begaim decided to request this loan because it will let her buy a cow for fattening and milk sales, and several sheep for resale in the autumn.\r\n\r\nKanatbek A. is forty-six years old.  His wife does not work and stays home with the youngest son.  Kanatbek has four children.  In order to support the family, he is involved in breeding livestock and earns about three thousand som per month.  He hopes to obtain this loan and buy one cow and four sheep for fattening.\r\n\r\nMayramkul S. is forty-eight.  She sells seven to eight liters of milk per day and earns about four thousand som per month.  Throughout the thirty years of marriage, she raised six children.

It has 5 members who know each other and are neighbours. Miss Tita A. M. is a member of the La Parota group. She is 44 and studied up to high school, obtaining her certificate. She has 5 children: Bonifacio is 21 and works; Juan is 19, married and works; Antonio is 13 and in high school; Gloria is 10 and is in elementary school; and Ana is 8 and is in elementary school. Tita requested this loan for the purchase of thread and clasps to have material for her industrial workshop. She manufactures orders from T\u00e9tela del Volc\u00e1n and takes pre-cut uniforms which she stitches and finishes up. Once they are ready, customers come from T\u00e9tela del Volc\u00e1n to pick them up at her house. In 15 to 20 days she has finished uniforms for San Luis Potos\u00ed and M\u00e9xico. \r\nShe started her business 4 years ago, sewing on a pedal machine, and later she bought her industrial machines, paying 50% in cash. She has been paying the other half with loans that she has received. She makes school uniforms, police uniforms, bulletproof vests, and riot police uniforms. She makes clothing for school dances for her customers in Jantetelco. She uses her earnings for this business to feed her children, repay her loans, and invest in thread and clasps. \r\nThe group members are Tita Gloria A. M., who will buy thread, clasps, fabric etc with her loan for her clothing, to provide better service;  Amelia E. Jayesi, who will buy board games to put with her video games; Maria Geomara E. Arag\u00f3n who will buy rabbits and alfalfa to raise and sell them; Jhanet Guti\u00e9rrez V., who will buy vegetables, bread, meat for hamburgers and teleras for her Mexican delicacy business; and Martina H. P., who will purchase underwear to sell through catalogues. \r\nThe group m embers want to tell Kiva and Fundacion Realidad \"to increase the amount you lend to us and lower our interest in order to help us expand our businesses\". Tita's sister and brother-in-law help her to sew, and she would like to buy 4 other different machines to make better products. The business is important because this is how they eat and maintain their children. Her favourite part of working in this business is sewing the uniforms and getting paid. She wants to open a larger store for the machines. Her dreams are to see her children grown with careers. The village of Jantetelco is a peaceful village. There are no problems. They make crystallized candy and baked fruit which are small baked goods.\r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Christine Cooper, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1975,"image":{"id":599804,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cloth & Dressmaking Supplies","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"the purchase of thread, clasps, and fabrics for her clothes-making","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MX","country":"Mexico","town":"JANTETELCO MORELOS","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"23 -102","type":"point"}},"partner_id":130,"posted_date":"2010-09-27T16:20:06Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":1975,"lender_count":72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Tita Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Amelia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maria Geomara","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jhanet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Martina ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-09-03T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MXN","disbursal_amount":25000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":5,"loan_amount":1975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-09-17T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2010-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2010-11-26T08:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2010-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":3125},{"due_date":"2010-12-24T08:00:00Z","amount":3125}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":246.88},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.87},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.88},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.87},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.88},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.87},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.88},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":246.87}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":246.88,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-20T08:27:02Z","rounded_local_amount":3155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172121210},{"amount":246.87,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:25:37Z","rounded_local_amount":3155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415373},{"amount":246.88,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2010-10-15T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:03Z","rounded_local_amount":3155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415374},{"amount":246.87,"local_amount":3125,"processed_date":"2010-10-29T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-15T14:26:30Z","rounded_local_amount":3155,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177415375},{"amount":493.75,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-12-15T14:16:10Z","rounded_local_amount":6310.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182554967},{"amount":493.75,"local_amount":6250,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:38Z","rounded_local_amount":6310,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188691457}],"funded_date":"2010-09-28T00:32:33Z","paid_date":"2011-01-15T13:17:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Christine Cooper","image":1766620}},{"id":236830,"name":"Soledad","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"\nLa socia pertenece al banco comunal \u201cCAMINEMOS JUNTAS\u201d; este banco est\u00e1 situado en el distrito de Huanchac, en la provincia de Cusco y departamento de Cusco.\n\nLa socia es la Sra.

There are people who earned a big amount and has an investment but there are some who are not successful and later they only found out the fortune that they looked for is in their own place. That\u2019s what happened to Jocelyn M., one of the active members of ASHI Antique North Branch. She is from Caridad, Culasi, Antique Philippines, she is already 41 years old and a single businesswoman. She is living with her elder brother Johny M., a fisherman.\r\n\r\nBefore her life in ASHI, she was experienced work in another country. She doesn\u2019t have any comment for her employer because they treat her as their family. Her salary was only enough for the needs of the family until she decided to go back here in Philippines without any savings. She decided to join ASHI last 2002.\r\n\r\nAt very start, she has been wise in utilizing her capital for her business, with her first loan in ASHI amounted to Php.5,000.00, she started to put a small variety store in their community. Little by little her business is improving and she earned it. Her income from this business really helps her to sustain her basic needs and to invest in some equipment like refrigerator and television.\r\n\r\nAs her loan increases, her project is also improving. Her variety store is expanding and she almost sell grocery items in there. She also put up small refreshment near her store. \r\n\r\nAs of now she wanted to repair the store so that it is convenient and more comfortable to the costumers and she is now proposing Php.25,000.00 for her next loan to realize these dream. \r\n\r\nShe is aspiring that someday, she will become financially stable so that she could also help her nephews and relatives.

She lives in a community in the Municipality of Tela, Atl\u00e1ntida.\r\n\r\nPaula\u2019s economic activity is baking \u2018pan de coco\u2019 bread which is made based on coconut milk.  The \u2018pan de coco\u2019 is a traditional product typical of the Gar\u00edfuna culture and is this ethnic group\u2019s main food staple.\r\n\r\nShe started this business through a group of women who baked bread to generate income.  Later, the group disbanded and she decided to continue producing and selling the product because the profits she obtained were attractive.  At present, she hires two people to help her distribute the bread.\r\n\r\nPaula has requested a loan to buy a stove with a large oven and to buy supplies like coconuts, flour, sugar and margarine as well as kitchen utensils that will facilitate production.  In the future, she plans to use profits to expand the business and do some home improvements.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":921880,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bakery","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"to buy a stove, supplies and kitchen utensils.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"HN","country":"Honduras","town":"Tela, Atlantida","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"15 -86.5","type":"point"}},"partner_id":201,"posted_date":"2011-12-01T08:02:33Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Paula ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2011-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"HNL","disbursal_amount":12000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2011-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-04-11T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2012-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":800},{"due_date":"2013-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":800}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2012-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2012-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2012-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2012-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2012-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2012-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2012-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2012-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2012-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2012-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2012-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2013-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2013-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.33},{"due_date":"2013-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":43.34},{"due_date":"2013-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":86.67,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2011-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-01-15T11:05:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1642.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":250854569},{"amount":43.33,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2012-02-29T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-03-15T10:45:45Z","rounded_local_amount":821.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":263405542},{"amount":43.33,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2012-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-04-16T08:38:24Z","rounded_local_amount":821.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":270120004},{"amount":86.67,"local_amount":1600,"processed_date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-05-15T10:48:59Z","rounded_local_amount":1642.33,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":276737061},{"amount":43.33,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2012-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-07-15T10:01:50Z","rounded_local_amount":821.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":287376371},{"amount":130,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2012-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-09-15T11:17:23Z","rounded_local_amount":2463.5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":301482644},{"amount":43.33,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2012-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2012-12-15T16:05:52Z","rounded_local_amount":821.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":323082924},{"amount":43.33,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2012-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-01-19T10:53:58Z","rounded_local_amount":821.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":332034704},{"amount":130.01,"local_amount":2400,"processed_date":"2013-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-02-15T17:47:21Z","rounded_local_amount":2463.49,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":339605422}],"funded_date":"2011-12-03T15:19:53Z","paid_date":"2013-02-15T17:47:21Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Polliz","image":1745056}},{"id":363903,"name":"Jitahidi Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Greetings from Jitahidi Group in Western Kenya!

In addition to her main business of buying and selling \u201cyayi boyi,\u201d she runs a business buying and selling incense.\r\nShe operates out of Sikasso\u2019s main market where she is much in demand and appreciated due to the quality of her products. \r\nTo satisfy her ever-increasing clientele, she decided, just five months ago, to rejoin the microfinance institution Soro Yiriwaso and is on her first individual loan. \r\nShe plans to use this first loan to buy 4 metric tons of \"yayi boyi\" dried fish in Dakar (Senegal) from wholesalers who sell to order.\r\nShe makes her own sales for cash or on credit to a clientele made up of women (from the city and especially stall holders). \r\nShe expects to make a monthly profit of CFA 100,000 which will mainly be used to increase her working capital, contribute towards the family expenses and pay the interest on the loan. The remainder will be invested in the business. \r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Sarah Llewellyn, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":230459,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Fish Selling","sector":"Food","themes":["Rural Exclusion","Conflict Zones"],"use":"To buy dried fish called \u201cYAYI BOYI\u201d.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"ML","country":"Mali","town":"Sikasso","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"11.316667 -5.666667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":78,"posted_date":"2008-12-01T08:00:46Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":12,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Sali ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-11-07T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":200000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.33},{"due_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","amount":33333.35}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-02-16T08:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.67},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.65}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2008-12-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-01-16T03:27:00Z","rounded_local_amount":34400.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":9974118},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-01-05T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-02-15T15:26:36Z","rounded_local_amount":34400.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":14889494},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-02-04T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-03-16T21:12:17Z","rounded_local_amount":34400.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":20440287},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-03-06T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T22:07:56Z","rounded_local_amount":34400.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27135655},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.33,"processed_date":"2009-04-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:28:21Z","rounded_local_amount":34400.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36033456},{"amount":66.66,"local_amount":33333.35,"processed_date":"2009-05-05T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:59Z","rounded_local_amount":34400.79,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44620823}],"funded_date":"2008-12-02T18:00:53Z","paid_date":"2009-06-16T02:38:59Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Sarah Llewellyn","image":44015}},{"id":80314,"name":"Leang","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Leang T. lives in Angk village in Kandal province.

Desde muy joven se ha dedicado al labrado de la tierra, con sumo cuidado cultiv\u00f3 sus plantas prest\u00e1ndole los cuidados necesarios para que fructifiquen sus c\u00edtricos, ahora se ha propuesto sembrar caf\u00e9 en dos cuadras y media. Cuando no hay trabajo que realizar en sus tierras, trabaja en chacras ajenas, por las que le pagan diario 15 soles, dinero que le sirve para la subsistencia de su hogar. Apolinario es un hombre muy activo, no le gusta estar sin trabajo, tiene muchas ganas de progresar y ahora est\u00e1 muy contento porque ya le toca cosechar pl\u00e1tanos de isla, tiene que preparar de 80 a 100 arrobas, que es igual a 12 kilos en el mercado. Pero para que pueda cosechar buenos frutos de este producto requiere mucha inversi\u00f3n de dinero y tiempo, por ello tiene que fumigar cada 20 d\u00edas a los plantones de pl\u00e1tano, y otro tanto, tiene que ir abonando para que la tierra empobrecida pueda brotar con buenos frutos y bien sazonados como lo cotiza el mercado. Apolinario es uno de los socios que no falla a las reuniones programadas por el analista de cr\u00e9dito, todo este tiempo ha pagado en la fecha indicada su cr\u00e9dito, y esta es la segunda vez que MFP le viene facilitando un pr\u00e9stamo, por lo cual est\u00e1 muy agradecido.

","en":"Apolinario, 30, lives with his partner of 9 years and their 3 children in a house near his farm.  He's worked on farms since he was a young boy, carefully tending his fields so that they would provide a bounty of the citrus fruits that he cultivates.  He now wants to grow coffee on two and a half \"cuadras\".  When there's not enough work to keep him busy on his own farm, he does farm work for others at 15 soles--about US$5--a day, money that is needed to pay the family's basic expenses.  Apolinario is an active man and he doesn't like to be without work.  He very much wants to get ahead and he's happy because he'll next harvest 80 to 100 \"arrobas\"--a local unit of measure--or roughly 12 kilograms of platanos for sale in the market.  Growing platanos, though, requires a large investment of both time and money.  The plants have to be sprayed every 20 days and the fields have to be fertilized so that the poor soil might produce the kind of fruit required by the market.  Apolinario is among those who never fails to miss a meeting with his credit analyst.  This is his second MFP loan and he always paid on the dates required by his past loan.  He's very grateful for the loans.  He will use this loan to buy fertilizers for his platanos fields.  He will also buy insecticides and other things that he needs for the farm.<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Jere Wiseman, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":650,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":650,"image":{"id":257057,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","themes":null,"use":"Buy fertilizer and insecticide for farming business.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"TARMA","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.419722 -75.690833","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-01-17T01:30:11Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":650,"lender_count":22,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Apolinario","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2008-12-22T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":2000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":650,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-01-21T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-02-20T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-03-22T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-21T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","amount":2000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-04-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":650}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":650,"local_amount":2000,"processed_date":"2009-06-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:52Z","rounded_local_amount":2057.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":52989663}],"funded_date":"2009-01-17T01:59:49Z","paid_date":"2009-07-15T22:42:52Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Jere Wiseman","image":30736}},{"id":88506,"name":"Flora","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mambo from Tanzania!

This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. <P>\r\n\r\nOne of the primary advantages of micro-leasing is that it allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":270252,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"To buy materials for making clothes","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-12T20:10:09Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Flora","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":7,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":100000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:56:00Z","rounded_local_amount":105599.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130734},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:08Z","rounded_local_amount":105599.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027522},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:35Z","rounded_local_amount":105599.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613523},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:43Z","rounded_local_amount":105599.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010602},{"amount":80,"local_amount":100000,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:16Z","rounded_local_amount":105600.01,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232888}],"funded_date":"2009-02-12T21:23:30Z","paid_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:16Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":92602,"name":"Adiara","description":{"languages":["fr","en"],"texts":{"fr":"Mademoiselle   Adiara    Samak\u00e9   est \u00e2g\u00e9 de 19 ans, c\u00e9libataire et m\u00e8re d\u2019un enfant, elle  vit chez son oncle maternelle au quartier Bougoufi\u00e9 de la ville de S\u00e9gou (quatri\u00e8me r\u00e9gion administrative de la r\u00e9publique du Mali).\nAyant vite abandonn\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9cole pour faire le commerce aupr\u00e8s d\u2019une de ses tantes qui faisait le commerce entre la r\u00e9publique du Togo et la r\u00e9publique du Mali, Adiara apr\u00e8s des ann\u00e9es d\u2019apprentissage fut impr\u00e9gn\u00e9e des tenants et aboutissants des activit\u00e9s commerciales.

She believes that if you love your family, you must do everything for their sake. This is the reason why she works so hard - to help her husband provide for the needs of their six children between ages 1 and 11.  The three oldest already attend school. Her aspirations are to provide a comfortable life for her family and send her children to school to prepare them for a better future.\r\n\r\nTo help her husband make their dream a reality, she started a general store.  Even with a small income, she knew she was helping her husband, so she continued her efforts and tried to offer more goods to her customers. To further increase her income potential, she started with a door-to-door vending business selling different kinds of root crops, vegetables, and fruits because these were abundant in her locality.\r\n\r\nWhen demand for her goods increased, she realized that she needed additional capital just to be able to maintain enough inventory, so she joined NWTF-Project Dungganon in 2002. With the help of successive loans which she was able to pay off quickly, her business improved even further, and she was able to earn a net monthly income of PHP 18,000 on average. She has started to set aside some of her income for the future of her children.\r\n\r\nFor her 13th cycle loan she borrowed PHP 22,000 which was utilized as additional capital for her general store and door-to-door vending. Her loan was paid on a weekly basis and it was fully paid without any delay. Now she is borrowing for her 14th cycle, the amount of PHP 23,000, as additional capital for her business once again. The income she earns from it will be used to make improvements to her general store structure and as additional capital for her door-to-door vending.\r\n\r\nAbout NWTF:\r\nIn a world full of challenges, Negros Women for Tomorrow Foundation (NWTF), is making a difference in the lives of thousands of women through Project Dungganon (a Hiligaynon word that means Honorable). Through the alleviation program, NWTF is empowering these women to progress out of earning less than $1 a day to achieving realities that surpass even their dreams. They have taken a life path that will ultimately make them Dungganon - a title of esteem that is bestowed to a member of a community who has earned the respect through a lifetime of hard and honest work.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":500,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":500,"image":{"id":429463,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"General Store","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"To make improvements to her general store.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Binalbagan, Negros Occidental","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":145,"posted_date":"2009-11-21T07:50:10Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":500,"lender_count":20,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Rosanna","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-11-11T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":23000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":500,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-16T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.24},{"due_date":"2009-11-23T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-04T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2010-01-25T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2010-02-08T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2010-02-15T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1769.23}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.47},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.47},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.46}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":115.38,"local_amount":5308,"processed_date":"2009-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:08:53Z","rounded_local_amount":5396.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103849023},{"amount":76.93,"local_amount":3538.16,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:01:12Z","rounded_local_amount":3597.39,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110739691},{"amount":153.84,"local_amount":7076.92,"processed_date":"2010-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-02-15T12:14:55Z","rounded_local_amount":7195.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":118129111},{"amount":115.39,"local_amount":5307.69,"processed_date":"2010-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:54:01Z","rounded_local_amount":5396.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123965907},{"amount":38.46,"local_amount":1769.23,"processed_date":"2010-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":1798.85,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128997820}],"funded_date":"2009-11-21T16:19:05Z","paid_date":"2010-04-15T09:37:30Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Stacy Beard","image":316373}},{"id":158355,"name":"Geyling De La Concepcion","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Geyling was working for a local factory when she lost her job.

A., 24, lives in Sacacoyo, located in the La Libertad department.  She lives with her husband, who works as an employee for a private company, and with her small daughter who is 5 months old.  Lorena has her own bakery, where she is responsible for making the bread and later selling it.  She sells some of the bread from her home, where the bakery is located, and she also takes the bread to distribute to some of her customers.  She has the advantage of having many customers who put in orders for large quantities, and who are loyal to her business.  Lorena requests a loan which she will use to buy flour at wholesale so that she can get it at a lower cost, as well as butter, sugar, honey, yeast and other products that are very important for making bread. Although developing her business has been fairly difficult, she has stood strong with the desire to grow as a small businesswoman and in this way provide a better future for her daughter.<br

He has worked at the same company for the last nine years. He works from 7.30 to 17.30 with a one-hour lunch break. He is able to provide for his family but not able to save anything because he needs his entire income to feed his family and continue building a house for them to live in.\r\n\r\nArmando is applying for a loan to buy cement, sand, stone and other construction materials for the partially-completed house he lives in with his family. He learned about the possibility of getting a loan from Kiva through his neighbors.\r\n\r\nWith that help, he dreams of finishing work on his house.

Marc is married to DJOSSOU F\u00e9licit\u00e9, housewife. The couple is raising four children, of whom two are their biological children. All the children are enrolled in school. \r\n\r\nMarc has been living for about seven years in Danmin, in the township of S\u00e8m\u00e8-Podji, with his wife and children. The couple share in covering the expenses of the family. Marc was not able to attend school for very long and afterwards learned the miller's trade. He has been working in this trade for about eleven years. Secondarily, he raises livestock at their home. He buys his products in Cotonou, economic capital of B\u00e9nin. \r\n\r\nThis is the first time that Marc is requesting from ALID\u00e9 a loan intended to bolster his business and acquire two other mills, one for maize and another for manioc. This will allow him to better serve his clientele. <br \/><p><strong>Translated from French by Teresa Kramer, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":950,"image":{"id":546512,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Services","sector":"Services","themes":null,"use":"purchase of a mill for manioc and another for maize","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BJ","country":"Benin","town":"SEME-PODJI","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"6.383333 2.616667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":104,"posted_date":"2010-05-27T16:20:04Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":950,"lender_count":24,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marc ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2010-04-28T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"XOF","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":15,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-11-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2010-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.67},{"due_date":"2011-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":41666.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2010-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2010-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2011-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2011-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2011-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2011-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":79.23,"local_amount":41700,"processed_date":"2010-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-07-15T09:08:43Z","rounded_local_amount":42289.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":151835718},{"amount":79.1,"local_amount":41633.34,"processed_date":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-08-15T09:10:14Z","rounded_local_amount":42222.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":159576115},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-09-30T08:14:35Z","rounded_local_amount":42255.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":166954629},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":41666.67,"processed_date":"2010-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-10-29T09:13:32Z","rounded_local_amount":42255.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":172056286},{"amount":79.48,"local_amount":41833.32,"processed_date":"2010-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-11-28T09:31:21Z","rounded_local_amount":42424.82,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":177347821},{"amount":79.23,"local_amount":41700,"processed_date":"2010-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:28Z","rounded_local_amount":42289.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":182482857},{"amount":79.23,"local_amount":41700,"processed_date":"2010-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-01-15T11:57:50Z","rounded_local_amount":42289.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":188617672},{"amount":79.23,"local_amount":41700,"processed_date":"2011-01-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-26T09:06:19Z","rounded_local_amount":42289.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":191361069},{"amount":79.23,"local_amount":41700,"processed_date":"2011-02-28T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-03-27T09:14:40Z","rounded_local_amount":42289.61,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":195779769},{"amount":236.93,"local_amount":124700,"processed_date":"2011-03-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:20Z","rounded_local_amount":126463.21,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":201401575}],"funded_date":"2010-05-28T01:15:52Z","paid_date":"2011-04-16T08:08:20Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"teresa kramer","image":1940938}},{"id":208168,"name":"Nazia's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nazia is wife of A. and lives in Multan, a city of sweetmeats in Pakistan.

It has also produced great thinkers, philosophers, scientists and poets, including Rudaki, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Jomi, and Rumi. The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC. And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions.\n\nBut Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics. The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy. In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable. These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia. While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty.\n\nIMON's History\n\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition. Funds raised through Kiva have already been distributed to thousands of IMON International's clients and will continue to provide thousands more with permanent access to the varied financial services they need.

Especially remarkable are Senegal\u2019s networks of rotating savings and credit associations, known as tontines. Commonly organized by groups of twenty to thirty housewives who live in the same village, the tontines provide poor women throughout the country with small loans to finance modest income-generating activities. Repayment rates within these associations are excellent, because they are based on local reputation and personal trust between the members. However, their financial resources are limited to the contributions of their members, frequently subsistence farmers with very little disposable income. This has prevented the traditional tontines from meeting the demand for rural microenterprise loans and restricted their impact on the economic development of their communities.

The organization is engaged in the economic empowerment of women in Tanzania through the provision of a leasing and leaseback microfinance facility. Customs and traditions in Tanzania make it difficult for women to own land and assets, thus they are termed non-creditworthy by financial institutions. This leads to poor financial support and poor access to basic needs and services for women with low incomes. One of the primary advantages of micro leasing is that is allows clients to use the equipment as collateral for future loans with SELFINA, thus enabling them to borrow larger sums in the future.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":400,"image":{"id":270290,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cereals","sector":"Food","themes":null,"use":"To purchase more grains like beans, rice, and maize flour","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TZ","country":"Tanzania","town":"Mwanza","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-2.516667 32.9","type":"point"}},"partner_id":90,"posted_date":"2009-02-12T06:50:05Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lucia","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-02-25T08:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TZS","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50000},{"due_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","amount":50000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2009-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-03-24T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-04-15T21:55:59Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":27130739},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-04-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-05-15T23:24:04Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":36027527},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-05-23T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-06-16T02:13:34Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":44613528},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-06-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-07-16T00:01:42Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":53010607},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-07-22T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-08-15T18:38:16Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":63232893},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-08-21T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-09-15T21:52:24Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":73664690},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-09-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-10-16T02:45:46Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":87105417},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-10-20T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-11-16T06:26:41Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":97022562},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-11-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T14:41:39Z","rounded_local_amount":52544,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103867811},{"amount":40,"local_amount":50000,"processed_date":"2009-12-19T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:33Z","rounded_local_amount":52543.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110757012}],"funded_date":"2009-02-13T04:12:21Z","paid_date":"2010-01-15T16:44:33Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"June Blender","image":123338}},{"id":92618,"name":"Gulsarakhon","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"M.

The country is home to communities that still speak the ancient Sogdian language, epic mountain passes, and a civilization that dates back to the 4th millennium BC.  And, even today, it is a complex mixture of the Islamic faith, Soviet culture, New West culture and Central Asian traditions. \r\n\r\nBut, Tajikistan is also the poorest of the former Soviet republics.  The civil war, which ignited soon after its independence from the U.S.S.R., further damaged the already weak economy.  In addition, 93% of the country is mountainous and only 7% of the land is arable.  These conditions have resulted in high levels of unemployment and have forced hundreds of thousands to seek work in other countries, mainly Russia.  While the people of Tajikistan are working to improve its agricultural production and manufacturing sector, nearly two-thirds of the population still live in abject poverty. \r\n\r\nIMON's History\r\nSince December 2007, IMON International has worked closely with Kiva and Kiva lenders to ensure that poor and low income clients represent a viable business proposition.

She also support her parents, who live in Boane, and to whom she sends 1.000,00MT each month, and her nephew, who lives with her in her home. <p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\nAfter her father lost his job, Francilia's live was very difficult, as she no longer had money for transportation to get to school and had to traverse long distances on foot. When she was attending 6th grade classes in the old system she was sick for 2 years in the hospital and unable to go to school. Years later, she entered the Red Cross of Mozambique where she worked at first as a servant and, because of her dedication, she earned a scholarship to take a course in the Institute of Social Action. She was assigned to Nampula where she married her late husband. Because of her husband's death, she asked to be transferred and she was assigned to Namacha as a technician in the District Service of Women's Health and Social Action, where she has worked for more than 10 years from 7:30 a.m. until 3:30 p.m., except on Mondays and Thursdays when she provides services to the municipality of the same district, earning 3.324,00MT. <p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\nBesides being a technician for Social Action, she has also been a member of the Municipal Assembly for the past 8 months, earning a monthly salary of 5.314MT in a 5 year contract. \r\n<p\/>\r\n<p\/>\r\nAs she is tired of living in a house of the Institute, she approached Hluvuku and Kiva, looking for her first loan to secure the title to her land for the amount of 5.000,00MT.

Pero como ya que estamos pr\u00f3ximos al verano, Margarita es conciente que la demanda de sus chocotejas bajar\u00e1, es por ello que piensa invertir en la compra de m\u00e1s productos de belleza, su otro negocio, el cual le gusta tanto como la elaboraci\u00f3n de los chocolates. \nMargarita siempre ha trabajado y le ha puesto muchas ganas a lo que hace, es por ello que al negocio que se dedique le resultar\u00e1 satisfactorio, pues como ella dice: \u201csi uno se dedica bien al trabajo, \u00e9ste le corresponde\u201d.\n\nEste es su primer pr\u00e9stamo con MFP con su nuevo grupo solidario, ya que anteriormente perteneci\u00f3 a otro grupo y ahora espera ser tan puntual como lo fue con sus anteriores cr\u00e9ditos. Con el dinero que ahora solicita comprar\u00e1 mayor cantidad de productos de belleza y as\u00ed lograr\u00e1 buenos ingresos este verano. \n","en":"Margarita, 42, lives in her own house with her life partner and their three children.  She adores them, and they are her motivation to get ahead.\r\n\r\nFor five years she has been selling beauty products and making rich \u201cchocotejas\u201d (chocolates).  These are very popular in the winter and spring because the inclement cold makes people want to warm themselves by eating this rich sweet.  Now that we are close to summer, Margarita is aware the demand for her chocotejas will go down.  That is why she plans to buy more beauty products for her other business, which she likes as much as making chocolates.\r\n\r\nMargarita has always worked and put much effort into what she does.  That is why the business she devotes herself to is satisfactory.  As she says, \u201cIf one devotes themselves well to their work, the work will respond in kind.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is her first loan with MFP with her new supportive group.  She previously belonged to a different group.  She now expects to be punctual like was with her previous loans.  She will use the money she is now asking for to buy beauty products.  That way she will get good income this summer. \r\n\r\n<br \/><p><strong>Translated from Spanish by Ginny Kalish, Kiva Volunteer<\/strong><\/p>"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":325,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":325,"image":{"id":420932,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cosmetics Sales","sector":"Retail","themes":null,"use":"Increase merchandise","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Lima","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.05 -77.05","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2009-11-06T15:01:15Z","planned_expiration_date":null,"loan_amount":325,"lender_count":11,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"tags":[],"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Margarita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2009-10-14T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":900,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":325,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2009-12-14T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-01-14T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","amount":150},{"due_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2010-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17},{"due_date":"2010-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.16},{"due_date":"2010-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"partner","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.2}},"payments":[{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2009-11-14T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2009-12-15T13:54:39Z","rounded_local_amount":157.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":103843166},{"amount":108.33,"local_amount":300,"processed_date":"2009-12-31T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-01-15T21:06:23Z","rounded_local_amount":314.17,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":110734748},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-02-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-03-15T10:48:58Z","rounded_local_amount":157.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":123959813},{"amount":54.16,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-03-13T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-04-15T09:32:50Z","rounded_local_amount":157.09,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":128992658},{"amount":54.17,"local_amount":150,"processed_date":"2010-04-14T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:24Z","rounded_local_amount":157.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":136717441}],"funded_date":"2009-11-09T20:15:33Z","paid_date":"2010-05-15T11:37:24Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0},"translator":{"byline":"Ginny Kalish"}},{"id":154236,"name":"Hayfa'a","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Hayfa'a is married with seven members in her family.

excellent service. He began his career by working for another barber, and saved his money to go out on his own. Lazaro now has his own store and a loyal clientele base. He also rents chairs in his shop to other barbers. Lazaro is proud to create employment opportunities for others in his community.\r\n\r\nThe proceeds from Lazaro\u2019s ACCION USA loan will allow him to remodel and modernize his shop, including several \"green\" improvements. With the help and support of his parents, this Cuban-born entrepreneur is determined to continue succeeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b> About U.S. Microfinance and ACCION USA:<\/b>\r\nHave you ever thought about how the cute new caf\u00e9 on your corner or the salon you frequent every month got the financial resources to start their business? Chances are, they drummed up support from their friends and family, dipped into their personal savings, used a high-interest credit card, or all of the above. An estimated ten million small businesses in the U.S. face difficulty obtaining loans from traditional banks, even prior to the current \u201ccredit crisis\u201d. Microfinance institutions, like ACCION USA, support these \u201cunbanked\u201d small businesses by giving them access to fairly-priced capital and business education.\r\n\r\nSmall businesses also help stabilize low- to moderate-income neighborhoods and rebuild our economy through income growth and job creation. Self-employment provides workers with a way to increase their incomes, support their families, and strengthen their communities. As unemployment rises in the U.S., more and more people are turning to self-employment and start-up enterprises as a way to take control of their economic futures and provide employment opportunities in their communities. The need for support of small businesses in the U.S. is great, and it is one that ACCION USA has been striving to meet since 1991.\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10000,"image":{"id":500305,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Barber

Her customers are usually friends, neighbors and residents. She hopes to expand her business in the future. She loves this business because she is able to help her husband with meeting the basic needs of the family.  \r\n\r\nShe is 38 years old and married with two children.

This time, for her 18th loan, she is borrowing PHP 18,000 to pay for repairs of her pump boat and purchase another pump boat so that she can continue to save up for future family needs.
